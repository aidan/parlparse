<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Fréchette</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Mr. President, allow me first to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of October. As usual, your firm hand is providing steady leadership for Council proceedings this month. Let me also thank your predecessor, Ambassador Yañez-Barnuevo for his effective leadership during the month of September.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Today, President Aristide returned to Haiti. It is with great pleasure that I join with you, other members of the Security Council, the international community, but above all with the people of Haiti, in celebrating this historic occasion. This afternoon, in the presence of thousands of his fellow citizens and representatives from many countries, including my own Foreign Minister, President Aristide resumed office.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">With this event, three long years of brutality have ended. We salute the courage of all those in Haiti who fought to bring democracy back to their country, and the memory of those, both well-known and unsung, who perished in the struggle. Their aspirations have prevailed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The restoration of President Aristide to office is a success for the international community. The commitment and the combined efforts of individuals, groups and international organizations have been key to attaining this outcome. As one of the group of Friends of Haiti, Canada shares with tremendous satisfaction the realization of our common objectives.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Fréchette</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">The peaceful deployment of the multinational coalition under the authority of the United Nations has played a decisive role in establishing conditions which have allowed the return of President Aristide. We commend the coalition for its efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">Canada supports a rapid transition from the multinational operation to the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) when a secure and stable climate has been established in Haiti. We reiterate our commitment to take part in UNMIH, which will help Haitians to consolidate peace and democracy and to build a stable society. We welcome the return of the joint United Nations/Organization of American States Civilian Mission, which also has an important role to play in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">Haitians are already working to achieve these objectives. The Haitian Parliament is sitting once again and democratic leaders are resuming their duties. Canada firmly supports the appeal of President Aristide for cooperation and reconciliation at a time when Haiti is once again embarking upon the road to democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">President Aristide has asked the international community to support reconstruction efforts in Haiti. Haiti will need quick and considerable support. Last week, a group of donors, including Canada, worked together to eliminate arrears in Haitian debt to international financial institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">Canada intends to make a considerable contribution to the reconstruction efforts. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada today announced in Port-au-Prince that Canada will devote $30 million to this end in the next six months.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">No one denies the dangers that still exist, the challenges that lie ahead, or the set-backs that might be experienced as Haiti finds its way. However, let us at least for today focus on what has been achieved: President Aristide has returned, democracy is being restored. Finally, Haitians can feel with confidence that they are leaving behind a dark episode and working towards a better future.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">I thank the representative of Canada for her kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Haiti. Before calling on him, may I just say in my own name my greatest congratulations on this very momentous day for his country. I now call on him.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Longchamp</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">Just a few hours ago, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to Haiti after three years of enforced exile in order to resume his duties and pursue the mandate entrusted to him by the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">This is a great day for the Haitian people who, for three long years, have heroically resisted and fought to ensure that the military dictatorship did not become permanently installed in Haiti. This is a great day for Haiti because with peace restored, the people can devote itself to reconstruction and economic development. This is a great day for the international community, which put forth tremendous efforts to provide a solution to the tragic situation that the <i>coup d'état </i>had produced in Haiti. Finally, it is a great day for democracy, for which we all struggle, because this victory represents progress for democracy throughout the world.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">The return of President Aristide once again demonstrates that when consensus is reached, the international community has the means to have its decisions implemented. A first step has been successfully taken. Much remains to be done to establish that democracy once and for all.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa04">As you well know, democracy and development are related and there can be no true peace if the living conditions of the population are not improved. In that respect, we appeal to the international community to help us to rebuild a country that three years of depredations by a military regime have virtually ruined. We rely on the generous assistance of all our friends and international partners to enable us at least to cope with the obligations that are before us.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa05">To conclude, let me once again, on behalf of the Haitian people and my Government, express heartfelt thanks to the international community, which has contributed so largely to the dawning of this day.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa03">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa01">I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of October. My delegation feels reassured by your experience and skill that we shall have fruitful results from our deliberations this month.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa02">We wish also to thank Ambassador Yañez-Barnuevo of Spain for the very able leadership he provided the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa03">In 1991 the fledgling democratic process which brought President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the highest office in Haiti was brutally halted by the force of arms. Constitutional rule was trampled on by a junta, and appalling scenes of violence against human dignity became routine. The <i>coup d'état </i>against the constitutional President received the strongest condemnation from the Brazilian Government. We consistently supported the diplomatic efforts pursued by the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) and promptly implemented the embargo against the de facto authorities aimed at the re-establishment of democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa04">Today we warmly welcome the return of President Aristide to Haiti. We are particularly honoured by the words that President Aristide expressed personally to our representative to the OAS in appreciation for Brazil's stance in the course of the process.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa05">At the time of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 940 (1994)</a> the Brazilian delegation stated the view that the issue of using force under Chapter VII in relation to a country of the Western Hemisphere was a matter we regarded with the utmost seriousness. Our main reservations related to authorization for the establishment and deployment of a multinational force with a broad and vague mandate. Reservations were also expressed by Latin American countries non-members of the Security Council at the formal meeting when <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a> was adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa06">The draft resolution before us today contains concepts that my delegation cannot support. To do so would be inconsistent with the position taken by my delegation in relation to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>, particularly in view of our respect for the principle of non-intervention contained in the Constitution of Brazil. We are not prepared to give retroactive endorsement to provisions of a draft resolution about which we have expressed reservations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa07">With the re-establishment of constitutional order in Haiti the challenging task of political and economic reconstruction is at the top of the agenda of the legitimate Government and will certainly require the firm support of the international community. Brazil stands ready to contribute actively in this effort.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Brazil for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ayewah</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Permit me to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. You have already demonstrated your well-known diplomatic skills in the efficient and admirable manner in which you have been conducting the affairs of the Council. Please be assured of my delegation's cooperation in the discharge of your important assignment.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">I should also like to convey my delegation's gratitude to Ambassador Yañez-Barnuevo of Spain for the skilful and efficient manner in which he conducted the affairs of the Council during the month of September.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">My delegation welcomes the return today to Haiti of President Aristide. His peaceful return is due to the tremendous efforts of the United Nations, its Secretary-General, the regional organization and other Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">My delegation has been encouraged by the fact that the activities of the multinational force are creating the conditions under which the relevant Security Council resolutions and the provisions of the Governors Island Agreement are being implemented. We hope that the full and peaceful implementation of the Governors Island Agreement, freely entered into by the former military leaders and President Aristide, will now proceed expeditiously. This development gives my delegation the assurance that the prospects for peacefully resolving the Haitian crisis are better today than they would have been had forceful military intervention proceeded as planned.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Indeed, when my delegation supported <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a> it was not our judgement that, as of that time, the status of the problem justified forceful military intervention. That would have led to wanton loss of life and destruction of property in Haiti. Fortunately, wise counsel prevailed and the situation has now been resolved peacefully.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">We hope that, with President Aristide's return, the processes of rehabilitation, reconstruction and, more important, national reconciliation will begin, with the support and encouragement of a determined people and the assistance of the international community. Our hope and wish is to see a Haiti that is at peace with itself, able to pursue its development in peace and dignity.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">In the light of this expectation, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before the Council.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">My delegation wishes to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the Security Council for this month. I should like to take this opportunity also to thank the Ambassador of Spain for the competence and wisdom with which he conducted the Council's affairs last month.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The Rwandese delegation wishes to join with others in expressing joy at the return of President Aristide to his country and, hence, at the restoration of democracy in Haiti. We take this opportunity to congratulate the coalition of countries of the region, and other friends of Haiti, that have cooperated in the achievement of this objective. My delegation wishes peace and democracy to reign and become rooted in Haiti, and wishes the Haitians and their descendants to enjoy their benefits for a long time to come.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">To this end we think that other steps should be taken so that Haiti will be able to reach the point of no return in peace and democracy. As is well known, there is neither peace nor democracy without development. Haiti, while it belongs to the Northern Hemisphere, has a population that is facing an economic situation which cannot be compared to that of the other countries of the region. Peace in poverty, democracy with a subjugated population: that is difficult for any Government, even the most democratic one, to deal with. That is why my delegation appeals to the countries of the region, which have just safeguarded democracy in Haiti, to replace military cooperation with lasting economic cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">My delegation is convinced that this is the only way the people of Haiti and its Government will be able to enjoy democracy and lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">I shall vote for this draft resolution, considering it as fostering the beginning of new development for Haiti.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa01">Let me congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency. We look forward to a month of hard work led clearly and diplomatically. I would also like to thank the Permanent Representative of Spain for the excellent job he did during the preceding month.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa02">Today, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has returned to Haiti. To President Aristide we say: <i>Bienvenue, Monsieur le Président</i>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa03">This is indeed a happy occasion. With the return of Haiti's freely elected leader to rightful rule, the first essential step has been completed towards national renewal under democratic government. This Council can and should rightfully take satisfaction from this success. For three years, the United Nations and the Organization of American States have toiled to achieve this moment. On behalf of my Government, I commend all those who have worked so hard for so long.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa04">These years have seen moments of hope, as with the signing of the Governors Island Agreement, and moments of infamy, as with assassinations in Haiti of Guy Malary, Georges Ismery and Fr. Jean-Marie Vincent. Today we must remember the many thousands of Haitians who lost their lives during the years of brutal dictatorship.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa05">Today, however, does not belong to the international community, not even to President Aristide. Today belongs to the people of Haiti. Today we must share their joy and celebrate the end of their oppression.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa06">Our hopes and our prayers are with the people of Haiti as they begin to rebuild their country, as they begin to recover their fragile freedom, as they begin to restore an interrupted democracy and, most importantly, as they begin to reconcile, in the words of President Aristide, Haitians with Haiti. To the people of Haiti we say: We are with you and we will help you.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa07">I must pay a special tribute to the personnel of the Multinational Force (MNF) in Haiti for their exemplary contribution in bringing Haiti to this day. These valiant women and men represent the finest traditions of the 30 nations from this region and other regions which are participating in this peaceful effort to bring democracy to Haiti. To the MNF we say: Well done, and thank you.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa08">The hard work is not over. Today's triumph must not obscure tomorrow's tasks. The international community, and especially the United Nations, stand with the people of Haiti to assist their efforts at restoration, reconciliation and reconstruction. But let us not forget that it is only the people of Haiti who can ensure the success of democracy and the promise of prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa09">In some months, the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), as authorized by this Council under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>, will replace the MNF to continue the work already begun in Haiti. We look forward to that day and to a Haitian future of peace and democracy.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">The adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-948(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 948 (1994)</a> by the Security Council fills us with very special satisfaction. My country has been involved from the first in various aspects of the lengthy and at times painful resolution of the Haitian crisis: in the political efforts in the framework of the Organization of American States (OAS); in the group of Friends of the Secretary-General, where we worked and continue to work with the United States, France, Canada and fraternal Venezuela; and in terms of our participation in this organ of the United Nations; in the special task force entrusted with monitoring the sanctions imposed by the Council through the presence for many months of vessels of the Argentine Navy; in the group of observers along the Haitian-Dominican border through the presence of personnel from our national police force; in the Multinational Force (MNF), with 100 or so monitors from our police force and military support personnel, who are cooperating with the many other countries of the Caribbean and the rest of the region also at work in the MNF.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">We shall continue to contribute personnel to the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) and, indirectly, through the presence of the former Special Envoy of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the OAS, Mr. Dante Caputo, to whom we pay a tribute for the courage and the tenacity he has shown in his efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">The Argentine presence at the national, regional and multinational levels through the various turns in the resolution of the Haitian crisis did not and will not have any other goal than the return to the process of democracy by that sister nation, its pacification and its dignified restoration to a community of nations in which democratic values and the respect and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms prevail.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">That multiple goal is of the greatest importance, and it should of course prevail over any rhetoric. Despite advances, setbacks, and turns in the process of resolution of the Haitian crisis that was carried out with firmness through three years of dictatorial regime, we thought that, after the signing of the Governors Island Agreement, we were closer to a solution; but the stubbornness, lack of good faith and failure to keep their word of the de facto authorities who had seized power in Haiti extended and worsened the suffering of the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">Nevertheless, we in this Council did not falter in our efforts. We continued to exert pressure: at first, through a regime of sanctions, until an unsustainable situation of violence and barbarism by the de facto authorities against the people of Haiti demonstrated that it was absolutely necessary to set in motion under the United Nations Charter, in conformity with its Articles, the machinery provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>. These peaceful goals prevailed, and this led to a rebirth of hope among a people that had suffered so much and yet through all of this adversity had borne its burden with the utmost dignity.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">Without the support of the members of the Council which made possible the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>, the present situation would not have come about. To all of them, we offer our appreciation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">It remains only for me to renew Argentina's commitment to continue working in support of Haiti with the same conviction and spirit that have motivated us thus far, and to express a heartfelt tribute to all the individuals who have committed their efforts to this noble cause, from the personnel of the International Civilian Mission (MICIVIH), who went through such difficult moments in the field, to the humanitarian aid organizations and the staff of the Secretariat, who on more than one occasion risked their safety in this common endeavour. We hail especially the personnel of the Multinational Force in Haiti, and the countries of the region and outside it that are standing there with us, each playing its role, but all with the same objective: to return to the people of Haiti the sovereignty that has been taken from them. All of these groups have fully carried out the mandate of the international community and have done so with a sense of responsibility in keeping with the circumstances they have had to face.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">Today, we come to the end of a chapter that some believed could not be finished. It fuelled the hope of a people that today, along with its martyrs, is celebrating the rediscovery of freedom. To President Aristide, we say: &quot;Welcome home.&quot; We also welcome his clearly conciliatory attitude. However, today certainly does not mark the end of the task to which we have committed ourselves on behalf of the people of Haiti and for the reconstruction of that country.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, the French delegation would like to express to you its pleasure at seeing you leading the work of the Council for this month with your well-known skill. I should also like to tell the Ambassador of Spain how grateful we are to him for the manner in which he performed his duties as President last month.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">My delegation voted with a very great sense of satisfaction in favour of the resolution welcoming the return of President Aristide to Haiti and recognizing the efforts of the Multinational Force that, in fact, made his return possible. This is a major success for the international community and for the Security Council, which, notwithstanding the many setbacks, has pursued the goal embodied in the Governors Island Agreement and reaffirmed in all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">I am pleased that after these three long years Ambassador Longchamp is here with us today to share in this success.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">In this connection my delegation regrets that the Council was not able to hail this clear success of the international community with unanimity. Whatever reservations were expressed when <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a> was adopted, no one can now refuse to acknowledge that without the deployment of the Multinational Force in Haiti President Aristide would not have returned to his country today and the Haitian people would have continued to suffer military dictatorship and to live in poverty. Hope has thus been restored to the people of Haiti, along with their ability freely to choose their own future.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">My delegation would like once again to pay a tribute to the leaders of the Multinational Force and all those participating in it. I would reiterate that my country will contribute substantially to the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), which we hope will take up its functions as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa01">I should like at the outset to express to you, Mr. President, the Spanish delegation's satisfaction at seeing you leading the Council's work with your accustomed ability and authority. I need hardly say that you will at all times have my delegation's full cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa02">I should also like to thank you, on behalf of my delegation, for the kind words you addressed to me at an earlier meeting with reference to Spain's presidency during the month of September and to express my gratitude for similar kind words voiced by other members today.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa03">Today is a day of celebration for the Haitian people, for the United Nations and for the international community as a whole. Accordingly, my delegation extends heartfelt congratulations to the Permanent Representative of Haiti, Ambassador Longchamp of Haiti. Indeed, we can all feel great satisfaction at what has taken place today in Port-au-Prince.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa04">Just over three years ago, on 30 September 1991, a <i>coup d'état </i>led by the head of the Haitian armed forces, a man appointed by President Aristide himself, expelled the legitimate President from the country, a President who had been elected months earlier with the overwhelming support of the Haitian people. With that, there came to a temporary end a promising chapter in Haiti's history, one that had begun with the holding of open, democratic elections recognized as such by the United Nations and other international observers.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa05">Unfortunately, it began to seem that at each turn in Haiti's history a new threat loomed on its horizon. At the end of the long Duvalier dictatorship, the military leaders who succeeded him showed contempt for the will of the Haitian people, and, after the return to democracy with the election of President Aristide, another military junta emerged to subjugate and exploit the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa06">Since that time, the international community has stood alongside the Haitian people in their attempts to return to the constitutional order wrested from them by force of arms. The situation in Haiti has not been critical only for that country's people, since, owing to the exceptional circumstances inherent in this case, the entire region has risked destabilization because of a humanitarian crisis that has led, at times, to massive displacements of population.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa07">In light of that situation, the Organization of American States recommended the adoption of measures that, in essence, constituted a trade embargo. The United Nations General Assembly, which has been seized of this matter since the moment the <i>coup d'état </i>occurred, beginning in October 1991 adopted a series of resolutions condemning the military regime and calling for a return to constitutional legality. On 3 July 1993 we also witnessed the signing of the Governors Island Agreement. Earlier, the Security Council had adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-841(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 841 (1993)</a>, which provided for a set of sanctions to oblige the de facto authorities to come to the negotiating table, thereby leading to that Agreement, the implementation of which then became the cornerstone of the international community's efforts. Today, 15 months later, we can say that those efforts have been crowned with success.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa08">The contributions of many States and international organizations, as well as of many people both within and outside Haiti, have enabled President Aristide, a few hours ago, 11 days after his address to the United Nations General Assembly, to fulfil the promise he made when he stated: &quot;In 11 days I shall be in Haiti&quot; <i>(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary meetings, 17th meeting (<a href="../html/A-49-PV.17.html">A/49/PV.17</a>)). </i>And so he is.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa09">In the last few hours the Haitian people have recovered their legitimate institutions and the President they democratically elected three years ago. Within a few hours, most of the sanctions imposed by the Security Council will have been definitely lifted.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa10">This is not the end of the road. Haiti's journey is just beginning. Today, the Haitian people, with the support and assistance of the international community, must now bend themselves to the task of consolidating democracy, of national reconciliation, of economic development and of social justice.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa11">In his recent address to the General Assembly, President Aristide described an ambitious programme of reconstruction leading up to the bicentenary of Haiti's independence in the year 2004, within a decade. The fulfilment of that programme presupposes and requires the help and cooperation of the international community, an international community that has placed the military and police forces contributed to the Multinational Force by 30 countries - the large part, I would emphasize, by the United States - at the service of restoring democracy to Haiti; an international community that will soon be deploying monitors in the International Civilian Mission made up jointly by the United Nations and the Organization of American States to supervise respect for human rights in Haiti; an international community that will later proceed to help Haiti make its police and armed forces more modern and professional through the deployment of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, in which Spain intends to participate.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa12">All those endeavours form part of the letter and the spirit of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-948(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 948 (1994)</a>, which the Council has just adopted. For that reason Spain joined the group of Friends of the United Nations Secretary-General for Haiti and other members of the Council in sponsoring the resolution, and not only because it reviews a past that has had a successful outcome, but also because it contains the beginnings of a future that we foretell will be better for the Haitian people.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I should like, first, on behalf of the delegation of the Russian Federation, to congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Security Council and to wish you success in your responsible work.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">Likewise, I express our gratitude to the Ambassador of Spain for his successful work as President of the Council during September.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">The Russian delegation would like to express its satisfaction over an important event in the life of the Haitian people - the return to Haiti of the country's legitimate President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. This event marks the beginning of a new, promising stage in the achievement of a settlement for this long-suffering country, which we hope will now be able to overcome the legacy of military dictatorship and restore democratic institutions in a spirit of true national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">In this connection, we think it important that the Council's decision today demonstrates its support for the efforts of President Aristide and those of the legitimate Government of Haiti, which are aimed at bringing Haiti out of its crisis to become a fully fledged member of the community of democratic States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">We also draw attention to the efforts of the Multinational Force in Haiti in the establishment of a secure and stable environment - a key factor for Haiti's return to normal life. We hope that the Multinational Force will carry out its mandate in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 940 (1994)</a>. We proceed on the basis that in due course the Council will have to analyse the situation in connection with the requirements of paragraph 8 of that resolution, a necessary condition for a decision by the Council to proceed to the second stage of the United Nations operation. Like other delegations in the Council, the Russian delegation intends, in this regard, to give special attention to the criteria for conducting peace-keeping operations - criteria that are becoming a regular feature of the Council's consideration of such problems.</p>
