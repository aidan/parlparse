<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2004-927.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2004/927</a>, which contains a letter dated 26 November 2004 from the Permanent Representative of the Netherlands concerning the establishment of a trust fund in connection with the security arrangements for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Members of the Council also have before them the draft of a letter, which I, as President of the Security Council, propose to send to the Secretary-General, informing him that the Council specifically endorses the creation of the trust fund envisioned in his letter of 26 November 2004 to the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, annexed to the aforementioned letter from the Permanent Representative of the Netherlands and requesting him to establish such a fund without delay and no later than 3 December.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">In the absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees that I should send the letter as drafted to the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">It is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">The letter will be issued as a document of the Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-2004-929.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/929</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">Let me just say that it is unclear whether the Security Council will have a meeting this afternoon. If it does not, this will be the last meeting of the United States presidency, and I want to thank all members of the Council for their excellent cooperation during what I think has been a very, very eventful month, especially because of the unusual nature of our meeting in Nairobi. It really took a lot of mutual effort. My view is that it was the United Nations and the Security Council at its very best.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">I would also like to express my appreciation for the assistance of the Secretariat during this month, especially in planning and executing the trip to Nairobi, but also in everything else we have done this month. I do express my appreciation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
