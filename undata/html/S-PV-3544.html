	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan, documents <a href="../pdf/S-1995-472.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/472</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-472-Corr.1.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/472/Corr.1</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1995-472-Add.1.pdf" class="nolink">S/1995/472/Add.1</a>.

	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sidorov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">The Russian delegation attaches great importance to the adoption by the Security Council of the draft resolution on extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT). The Mission's activities are an important factor stabilizing the situation in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border, and are facilitating the successful implementation of the inter-Tajik agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">The Russian Federation believes that there is a need to further reinforce the Mission's capabilities, as this would enable it to carry out its allotted tasks more effectively. We in particular intend to return to the question of an increase in the number of UNMOT personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">The Russian Federation actively supports the Secretary-General's proposal to deploy, with the agreement of the Afghan authorities, a special UNMOT unit in northern Afghanistan to allow for more direct liaison with the Tajik opposition and to establish a base for investigating, on both sides of the Tajik-Afghan border, violations of the agreement on a temporary cease-fire and the cessation of other hostile acts of 17 September 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">I should like once again to draw members' attention to the repeated appeals the leadership of Tajikistan and by the States contributing troops to the Peace-keeping Force of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) for a fully-fledged United Nations operation to be deployed in Tajikistan. As is well known, this idea is supported by the Tajik opposition too.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa05">We note that the draft resolution expresses satisfaction at the close liaison between UNMOT, the CIS Peace-keeping Forces and the border troops in Tajikistan. In the view of the Russian Federation, this close cooperation between the United Nations Mission and the CIS Peace-keeping force is an important factor for stabilizing the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa06">We are satisfied with the draft resolution submitted today for adoption by the Council, primarily because it directs the parties to search energetically for ways to achieve national reconciliation with a view to the fastest possible achievement of agreements on fundamental issues relating to Tajikistan's future political and constitutional order.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa07">The Russian Federation, as one of the observer States at the inter-Tajik talks held under United Nations auspices, is making its contribution to moving the peace process forward. It is clear, however, that only unswerving and full implementation by the parties of all the obligations they have undertaken can create a climate conducive to dialogue on the fundamental constitutional and political issues. The continuing acts of provocation in some areas along the Tajik-Afghan border by militant opposition die-hards by no means helps establish such a climate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa08">The Russian Federation expects that the Security-Council's urgent appeals will be heeded by the Tajik parties and will provide a significant boost to their efforts to seek ways to achieve national reconciliation.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Menzione</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">My delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) by six months, essentially because we take a positive view of the developments of recent weeks, despite the shadows still hanging over some areas of the inter-Tajik negotiating process.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The two primary factors allowing the mandate to be extended are firstly, the renewal of the agreement on a temporary cease-fire until 15 August 1995, and secondly, the decision by the Council of Heads of State of the Commonwealth of Independent States to extend the mandate of the Peace-keeping Force until the end of 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Italy is confident that the truce may actually last longer than the currently agreed period. In our view, the necessary conditions for the UNMOT Mission are the existence of the cease-fire and the maintenance of a certain momentum in the negotiations. Whatever their highs and lows, the inter-Tajik negotiations as a whole -- since the first round -- have seemed to follow a rather positive trend. Now they are enriched by the proactive participation of neighbouring countries and of the two organizations most directly interested, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">The conditions that the parties had set at various for continuing the negotiations -- regarding, for example, the agenda and the venue for the talks -- appear to have become less stringent over the past two months. We should not underestimate the work done by the Secretary-General's Special Envoy in facilitating, at various junctures, a dialogue that has finally been consolidated, especially through the meeting in Kabul between President Rakhmonov and the leader of the opposition, Mr. Nuri.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">While the fourth round of negotiations in Almaty did not produce the breakthrough that many had hoped for, it still scored strong points in favour of national reconciliation. Firstly, both sides seemed to have displayed a more flexible attitude, at least in the initial phase. Secondly, the session was characterized by broad participation, both governmental and intergovernmental, which showed how, in some cases, formulas that expand consensus are not necessarily an impediment to the momentum of negotiations. Thirdly, the political commitment of the parties, along with confidence-building and humanitarian measures, contributed to re-establishing what is, in our opinion, a very important factor: overcoming the psychological barriers between the leaders, who have shown that they can establish a concrete and direct dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">That this was the case in the meeting between the President of the Tajik Republic and the leader of the Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan is demonstrated by the communiqué they issued, which stated that they had committed themselves to continuing search for a solution to the problems that determine the fate of Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">My delegation takes note of this commitment, which is the best response to the appeal to the parties by the Head of State of the Russian Federation and by all the Central Asian republics, which emphasized that, while it is clear that the principal responsibility lies with the Tajik parties themselves, the burden of mutual mistrust and enmity complicates efforts to achieve real national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">In Kabul in mid-April and in Almaty in mid-May, steps were indeed taken in this direction. The international community, starting with the United Nations, is committed to democratic rehabilitation in Tajikistan. A significant contribution can be made by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the regional organization that in our opinion has a particular vocation to the promote democratic institutions and human rights. The excellent work being performed by the OSCE Mission in Dushanbe and the participation of the OSCE in the fourth round of negotiations in Almaty are further signs of this commitment.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wibisono</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Let me begin by conveying the Indonesian delegation's sincere appreciation to you, Mr. President, for preparing the draft resolution on Tajikistan now before the Council for adoption. I should like also to convey our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his informative report on the present situation in Tajikistan. We also wish to thank Ambassador Ramiro Píriz-Ballón, the Secretary-General's Special Envoy to Tajikistan, for his perseverance in his endeavours to promote the attainment of a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">During the course of our consultations, my delegation has made its position clear: the resolution of the conflict in Tajikistan can best be achieved through a peace process leading towards national reconciliation, within a framework that preserves the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tajikistan. We note with appreciation that this process has reached a stage at which the parties have started in-depth discussions on fundamental institutional issues and on the consolidation of Tajikistan's statehood, and have confirmed their readiness to search for practical solutions.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">With particular reference to the joint statement of May 1995 by the President of Tajikistan and the Chairman of the Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan, we are very much encouraged by the fact that both sides have confirmed their willingness to solve the inter-Tajik conflict through political means, to repatriate all refugees to their places of origin, to stabilize the political situation in Tajikistan fully and to extend the agreement on a temporary cease-fire and cessation of hostilities -- the Tehran Agreement of 17 September 1994 -- for another three months, until 26 August 1995. Moreover, other practical steps aimed at strengthening confidence-building measures have also been agreed by both sides.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">My delegation is therefore pleased to note that all these understandings and agreements arrived at by the two Tajik sides have been incorporated into the draft resolution and welcomed by the Council as measures to further the achievement of national reconciliation in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The convening of the fourth round of inter-Tajik talks on national reconciliation in Almaty under United Nations auspices, was in our view a most encouraging development. At that round of talks, the two Tajik sides conducted, for the first time, an in-depth discussion of fundamental institutional and political issues. My delegation considers that approach to be the best way towards achieving a comprehensive political settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">In this context, we draw particular attention to the call upon the parties to agree to the early convening of a further round of inter-Tajik talks with a view to resolving the remaining issues and to implement without delay all confidence-building measures agreed to by them -- <i>inter alia</i>, on the exchange of detainees and prisoners of war and on intensification of the efforts to ensure the voluntary return, in dignity and safety, of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">We most certainly encourage the continuation of direct political dialogue, which could lead towards genuine national reconciliation and to the restoration of peace in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">From the outset Indonesia has believed that the primary responsibility for resolving the conflict rests primarily with the Tajik parties themselves; all that the international community can do is provide only necessary assistance towards that end, it cannot impose a solution. In this regard, the presence of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) in the country has had a positive impact and has indeed contributed as a stabilizing factor. Its close contacts with the parties, as well as its close liaison with the Peace-keeping Force of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the border forces and the Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has been instrumental in containing the intensity of conflict and preventing it from spreading.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">It is in this light that my delegation supports the recommendation of the Secretary-General to extend the mandate of UNMOT for another six months, until 16 December 1995. It is our sincere hope that this will allow the parties to keep up their commitment to an effective cease-fire, national reconciliation and the promotion of democracy. Of course, it is imperative that the parties should continue to cooperate with UNMOT and to ensure the safety and freedom of movement of United Nations personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">Notwithstanding these positive developments, my delegation is particularly concerned to note from the report that the situation on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan remains tense and that the deepening economic crisis continues to have a negative impact on the efforts to achieve political stability. In this regard, we underline the urgency of ceasing all hostile acts and call on States and others concerned to discourage activities that would pose a hindrance to the peace process in Tajikistan as a whole. In this context, we look forward to the report of the Secretary-General on the discussions to be conducted with the Afghan authorities on the possible deployment of a small United Nations team in northern Afghanistan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">In conclusion, it is the hope of the Indonesian delegation that the draft resolution that we are about to adopt will create a climate conducive to accelerating the peace process towards genuine national reconciliation and the restoration of peace in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">In light of these considerations, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martínez Blanco</span> <span class="nation">Honduras</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">My delegation wishes to express its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his report dated 10 June 1995 on the situation in Tajikistan and the activities carried out by the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT).</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">My delegation believes that the conflict in Tajikistan must be resolved through peaceful means. Consequently, we welcomed the results of the fourth round of talks between the parties, held in Almaty from 22 May to 1 June this year, where, while the parties were unable to reach mutually acceptable solutions in the political and institutional sphere, they did achieve important agreements on the exchange of detainees and prisoners of war and on the voluntary return of refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">We also welcome the decision taken in Kabul on 19 May by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan and the leader of the Islamic Revival Movement to extend the Tehran Agreement on a cease-fire until 26 August this year.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">My delegation believes that direct dialogue between the Tajik parties is essential for reaching a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict. We therefore urge the parties to continue their dialogue so that they can overcome the outstanding problems and make substantive progress on institutional issues in order to consolidate Tajikistan's statehood. We also urge them to cooperate fully with UNMOT, the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, the Commonwealth of Independent States Peace-keeping Force, the Russian border forces and the Mission to Tajikistan of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">With regard to confidence-building measures, we believe that the voluntary return of refugees is an important element for establishing the necessary favourable climate for national reconciliation. We are therefore pleased to see that the Government of Tajikistan has committed itself to assisting the return and reintegration of refugees and displaced persons in dignity and safety. In this context, it is important for international organizations and States to provide the refugees and the Joint Commission with the necessary financial and material support.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">Finally, we wish to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General, his Special Envoy and the regional organizations that have fostered the dialogue between the Tajik parties for their renewed efforts for peace in Tajikistan. My delegation supports the Secretary-General's recommendation to extend UNMOT's mandate for an additional period until 16 December 1995, on condition that the parties keep up their commitments to an effective cease-fire, national reconciliation and the promotion of democracy. We also support his recommendation to deploy a group of observers in northern Afghanistan, in the way he suggests. My delegation will therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution before the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Qin Huasun</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">The Chinese delegation has been following developments in Tajikistan very closely, including Tajikistan's political settlement process. In our view, a settlement to the conflict in Tajikistan depends principally on the efforts by the parties in Tajikistan and on the effective implementation by the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) of the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council; that effective implementation also depends on the political will of the parties concerned towards a settlement to the conflict, and on what progress is actually made towards a political settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">In this connection, we have noted that President Rakhmonov of Tajikistan and the Chairman of the Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan, Mr. Nuri, held a bilateral meeting in mid May and that the two sides held a fourth round of talks on national reconciliation at Almaty from 22 May to 1 June 1995; during these talks, they conducted, for the first time, an in-depth discussion of fundamental institutional issues and on consolidating Tajikistan's statehood, and they reached agreements and adopted a joint statement on extending the cease-fire, exchanging prisoners of war and repatriating refugees. The Chinese delegation welcomes these positive developments.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">We sincerely hope that the parties, in order to accelerate the process of political settlement in Tajikistan, will implement in earnest the agreements reached in the fourth round of inter-Tajik talks; will continue to observe strictly and implement fully the Tehran Agreement, particularly the provisions for a cease-fire; will strengthen the supervisory and investigatory role of the Joint Commission in this connection; and will cooperate fully with UNMOT so as to facilitate stability in Tajikistan. We hope also that the parties will take effective measures to ease tensions along the Tajik-Afghan border.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">There is a Chinese saying that peace brings benefits to both sides while fighting hurts them both. The key to a fundamental solution to the Tajik conflict lies in the achievement of broad-based national reconciliation, and the only way to achieve national reconciliation is to give up using military means and seek a solution that both can accept through dialogue and negotiation. To this end, we urge President Rakhmonov and Mr. Nuri to continue their direct dialogue in order to build mutual confidence further, so advancing the process of achieving a comprehensive political settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">UNMOT has played a positive role in containing the conflict by assisting in the implementation of the cease-fire and in building mutual confidence. It has also maintained good relations with the Peace-keeping Force of the Commonwealth of Independent States. We hope that UNMOT's continued presence will help advance further the process of political settlement in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The draft resolution exactly reflects the laudable desire of the international community to provide the parties in Tajikistan with further assistance in order to achieve a lasting peace at an early date. The Chinese delegation will therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Legwaila</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">We have read with interest the Secretary-General's report on the situation in Tajikistan. It is encouraging to note that, after many months of prevarications, the parties have finally been able to break the deadlock and meet for the fourth round of the inter-Tajik talks on national reconciliation. This is a welcome development, even though the two sides could not reach agreement on a comprehensive political settlement. It is worth noting that the talks were held in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. My delegation hopes that the agreements reached at Almaty on the release of political prisoners and a safe return of refugees to their homes will pave the way for an overall settlement to the crisis in Tajikistan and bring about national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">There is no doubt that the presence of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) has served as a stabilizing factor and has provided an enabling environment for a peaceful settlement to the conflict. It is for this reason that my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">I wish, however, to emphasize the importance we attach to operative paragraph 2, which links the continued presence of UNMOT in Tajikistan to a commitment by both parties to an effective cease-fire, to national reconciliation and to the promotion of democracy. We are seriously concerned that, after four rounds of talks, no progress has been achieved on institutional matters. It is our hope that the parties will make full use of the presence of UNMOT in their country over the next six months and will cooperate with the Secretary-General's Special Envoy in his endeavour to promote a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">The international community has demonstrated its readiness to assist the people of Tajikistan. However, the international community can help only where the parties are in all seriousness ready and willing to resolve their differences. The ultimate responsibility for a peaceful settlement and national reconciliation lies with no one else but the people of Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">We have noted that an agreement has been reached to extend the cease-fire by three months. Our preference would have been for an indefinite extension.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">We appeal to the two parties to adhere strictly to the spirit and letter of the cease-fire. The resumption and intensification of hostilities during the month of April, in violation of the cease-fire agreement, and the resulting heavy casualties have not helped the peace process. We hope there will be no repetition.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, my delegation wishes to pay a special tribute to the positive and facilitative role played by the Russian Federation and other countries in the region -- and by the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe -- and to their efforts to bring about reconciliation between the two parties in conflict in Tajikistan. I should also like to extend my delegation's sincere appreciation to Ambassador Píriz-Ballón, the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, for his untiring efforts in the search for peace in Tajikistan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Khussaiby</span> <span class="nation">Oman</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">At the outset, allow me, Sir, to extend, on behalf of the delegation of Oman, our sincere thanks to the Secretary-General for his lucid report on the situation in Tajikistan. We take this opportunity to extend our support to him and to his Special Envoy, Mr. Píriz-Ballón, for the role they are playing in trying to help the Tajik parties achieve national reconciliation and to bring about a peaceful end to their conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">While we welcome the positive results arising from the Kabul meeting between the President of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, and the leader of the Tajik opposition, Mr. Abdullo Nuri, and the convening of a fourth round of talks in Almaty from 22 May to 1 June 1995, we particularly welcome the decision taken by parties to extend the agreement on a temporary cease-fire and cessation of other hostile acts.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">My Government concurs with the views expressed by the Secretary-General in his report to the effect that, despite the efforts exerted in this regard, the parties are still some way away from reaching a comprehensive settlement or addressing the substantive political issues, even though 14 months have passed since the first round of talks was convened.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">We therefore commend the Secretary-General's initiative in calling on the two parties to spare no time in making progress towards national reconciliation in Tajikistan through direct talks and candid cooperation. This is the only means to build mutual confidence between the parties, thus paving the way for the achievement of a comprehensive political solution to the crisis, given that the Tajik parties themselves must assume the responsibility for resolving the conflict and that the United Nations can play only a conciliatory and facilitating role in assisting them to achieve practical solutions. We call upon all parties to refrain from any act that could cause a deterioration of the situation, and we stress the need to respect international borders.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">There is no doubt that the Joint Commission established to monitor and verify violations of the cease-fire agreement has been functioning in a way that is not up to our expectations and not in accordance with the mandate assigned it by the protocol to the Tehran Agreement. We hope that the parties will give the Commission the required attention and will cooperate with it in a manner that will enable it to discharge its tasks more effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">We join the consensus prevailing among the members of the Security Council, who share the opinion today that there is a need to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT), as recommended by the Secretary-General, and we appreciate the positive role the Mission has been playing. My delegation will therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution before the Council.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Albright</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa01">The United States was pleased to support this resolution extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT). In many ways, this Mission demonstrates the flexibility of United Nations peace-keeping and its continued usefulness in conflicts around the world. With a small but influential presence, the United Nations has helped the parties to maintain an effective cease-fire and, through that, lay the groundwork for political reconciliation. We pay special tribute to the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Ambassador Píriz-Ballón.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa02">As the Secretary-General has reported, both parties to the conflict have recognized the instrumental role UNMOT has played in containing the conflict. But the limited cease-fire extensions and chronic incidents along the Tajik-Afghan border indicate that there is still much to be done to bring peace and prosperity to Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa03">While the Security Council has, through this resolution, extended UNMOT's mandate until December of this year, the resolution firmly and unambiguously links that mandate to the existence of an effective cease-fire and other conditions. UNMOT cannot function without a cease-fire: the parties must lay down their arms or the Council may be forced to take a decision to withdraw the Mission. But a cease-fire is just a beginning; the parties must move towards national reconciliation based on democratic principles. The parties have taken a first step in discussing, in Almaty, fundamental political and institutional questions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa04">Although progress towards national reconciliation still has far to go, the Secretary-General's report cites a few instances of a positive nature, which I would like to recall. President Rakhmonov met for the first time with the Chairman of the Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan, Abdullo Nuri, in Kabul. They were able to extend the cease-fire and agree to future meetings, raising expectations for the Almaty talks. The negotiators in Almaty were able to agree to implement confidence-building mechanisms such as the exchange of prisoners and detainees. On this point, I would like to stress the necessity of allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Joint Commission full access to places where prisoners and detainees are being held.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa05">In Almaty, the parties began to discuss mechanisms for a political settlement. Unfortunately, they were unable to reach agreement on the fundamental questions. We encourage the parties to redouble their efforts. The time has come for the parties to work towards the outline of a political accord. We look forward to an announcement of the date, place and venue of the next round of talks to build on the momentum of Kabul and Almaty. The United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and countries of the region stand ready to support and help implement an agreement. But the international community cannot make peace or move towards national reconciliation; it is the parties themselves who must take this responsibility, and take it soon.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Germany.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">My Government welcomes the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-999(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 999 (1995)</a> extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) for a period of up to six months. UNMOT is a small mission, but one to which we attach great importance. I would like to take this opportunity to thank its members for doing an excellent job under difficult conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">UNMOT, as the Secretary-General notes in his report, plays a key role in containing the conflict in Tajikistan. It does so by monitoring the cease-fire. At the same time, it provides vital support for the peacemaking efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Ambassador Píriz-Ballón.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">My delegation welcomes the fact that, after a long period of stagnation, dialogue between the Tajik parties has finally resumed. We would like to thank the Special Envoy, Ambassador Píriz-Ballón, as well as the observer countries for their contribution to the results achieved in the recent meetings at Kabul and Almaty. These results, though modest, represent badly needed progress. The parties must understand that the United Nations role, and UNMOT's presence in particular, depend not only on a cease-fire but also on a viable political process aimed at national reconciliation and the promotion of democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Germany remains concerned at the continued fighting on the Tajik-Afghan border. As the Secretary-General points out, this fighting involves the parties as well as Russian border forces. Against this background, we have taken careful note of the recent statement of the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation recognizing the validity of the cease-fire agreement for the Russian forces in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We believe that a United Nations presence in northern Afghanistan, as requested by both parties, could contribute to a lessening of tensions in the border area. Clearly, the attitude of the relevant Afghan authorities on this issue will be crucial. We hope that the Secretary-General will be able to persuade them of the utility of such a presence.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">Reporting to the Council in August 1993, the Secretary-General observed that the situation in Tajikistan</p>
	<blockquote id="pg008-bk01-pa08">"contains the seeds of a major threat to peace and security for Central Asia and beyond." (<i><a href="../pdf/S-26311.pdf" class="nolink">S/26311</a>, para. 35</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">My Government believes that that assessment remains true. That is why we encourage the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts with regard to a political settlement. My Government is ready to lend its full support to these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">There are no further speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
