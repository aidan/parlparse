<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">As the General Assembly begins its consideration of the question of implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, I have the honour to present the report of the Special Committee on decolonization on its activities during 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">The report is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/57/23</a> and consists of three parts. Part I of the report provides information on the history, organization and various aspects of the work of the Committee. It describes the matters on the Committee's agenda and its interaction with other United Nations bodies, as well as with intergovernmental, non-governmental and regional organizations. Part I also provides a review of the work of the Committee during the reporting period. I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to section J, in particular, which contains the projections for future work of the Committee in 2003, subject to the approval of this body.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">Part II of the report presents detailed information on the activities of the Committee with respect to the items on its agenda. It gives an account of its deliberations on such issues as the dissemination of information on decolonization; the question of sending visiting missions to the Territories; economic and other activities that affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories; military activities carried out by the administering Powers in the Territories; the implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and international institutions; and information transmitted under Article 73 (e) of the United Nations Charter. In addition, that part of the report includes a brief summary of the Special Committee's deliberations related to the 16 remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">Part III of the report contains the recommendations of the Committee, in the form of draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa05">The year under review was marked by a significant and outstanding event for the Special Committee on Decolonization and, indeed, for the United Nations. One of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, namely, East Timor, became an independent State. On 1 May 2002, the General Assembly, by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-282.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 56/282</a>, decided to remove East Timor from the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, upon its accession to independence. In September 2002, Timor-Leste joined the United Nations family as a new Member of the Organization. I take this opportunity to reiterate our warm congratulations to the Government and the people of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa06">During the period under review, the Special Committee continued to work within the framework of the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism and its Plan of Action. The Committee focused its efforts on two main areas: the continued review of the developments in the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and the development of programmes of work for specific Territories. Regarding information on the Territories, the Committee benefited considerably from the participation of the representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and experts in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa07">Regarding the development of programmes of work, the Committee continued to emphasize the need for constructive cooperation with the administering Powers for the successful completion of the decolonization process in all the Territories. The report of the Committee indicates that France participated in the work of the Committee during its consideration of the question of New Caledonia, while the delegations of the United Kingdom and the United States continued informal consultations with the Committee. The Special Committee is determined to intensify its efforts and to work with the administering Powers towards the development of work programmes for specific Territories under their administration.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa08">Nowhere has that cooperation been more productive than in the case of Tokelau, where the representatives of the administering Power, New Zealand, alongside Tokelau, have had fruitful discussions that have allowed us to achieve further progress in formulating the work programme for the Territory's decolonization. The meetings among the three parties, held in New York in 2001 and 2002, improved understanding of the tasks at hand. As a further development, in August 2002 a visiting mission of the Committee travelled to Tokelau. Once again, we should like to express our gratitude and appreciation to the Government of New Zealand and to the United Nations Development Programme, which organized and facilitated the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa09">The annex to Chapter II of Part I of the report contains information concerning the Pacific Regional Seminar held by the Committee in Fiji in May 2002. The participants in this year's Seminar included the delegation of the Special Committee; the United Kingdom, France and New Zealand, as administering Powers; other United Nations Member States; representatives of the Territories; and non-governmental and regional organizations, as well as experts. The Seminar provided a unique opportunity for direct interaction and exchange of views between Committee members and representatives of the Territories. It generated a fruitful and constructive discussion on political, economic and social issues. Its conclusions and recommendations represent an invaluable contribution to the future work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa10">As I noted earlier, during the past year, the Committee continued to consider the information transmitted under Article 73 (e) of the Charter by the administering Powers. With respect to economic activities affecting the interests of the peoples of the Territories, the Special Committee reaffirmed the legitimate right of the peoples of the Territories to their natural resources. On the issue of military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in the Territories, the Committee called on the administering Powers not to involve the Territories in any offensive acts or interference directed against other States. The Committee also considered the activities of the specialized agencies and of other international organizations in Non-Self-Governing Territories. The Special Committee reiterated the importance of the dissemination of information on decolonization and noted with appreciation the new brochure on decolonization produced in 2002 by the Department of Public Information in cooperation with the Department of Political Affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa11">The Committee has continued to devote special attention to political, economic and social issues related to the small island Territories. It has followed the situation in American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guam, Montserrat, Pitcairn, St. Helena, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands, as well as Tokelau and New Caledonia. The report also reflects the Special Committee's consideration of the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Gibraltar, the question of Western Sahara and the decision concerning Puerto Rico. The Special Committee's consideration of the developments in the Non-Self-Governing Territories has been facilitated by the working papers on each Territory prepared by the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, I should like to express the gratitude of the Special Committee to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his unconditional support of the Special Committee's efforts aimed at the eradication of colonialism. I should also like to highlight with appreciation the substantive political support and advice provided by the Department of Political Affairs, whose input has been invaluable in the work of the Committee and in the implementation of its mandate. I should also like to refer to the excellent technical Secretariat services provided by the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Acting President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01"> I now call on the Vice-Chairman of the Special Committee, Mr. Bernard Tanoh-Boutchoué of Côte d'Ivoire, to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-57-L.52.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/57/L.52</a> on behalf of the Chairman of the Special Committee.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tanoh-Boutchoué</span> <span class="nation">Cote d'Ivoire</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">I have the great honour, in my capacity as interim Chairman of the Special Committee, to address the General Assembly as it considers the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The Rapporteur, Mr. Fayssal Mekdad, has just presented to Members the report of the Special Committee (<a href="../pdf/A-57-23.pdf" class="nolink">A/57/23</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">On behalf of the Chairman of the Committee, who unfortunately was unable to be here today, I should like to present a few points regarding the activities carried out by the Committee during the past year, to introduce the draft resolution now before the Assembly (<a href="../pdf/A-57-L.52.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/L.52</a>) and to give Members an idea of the challenges that we shall all have to address together.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">As the Assembly is aware, despite the progress achieved since 1960, when the Declaration was adopted, the decolonization process continues because it has not yet attained all its goals. Two years ago, the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism began, and 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories remain on the United Nations list. Over the course of the year, in accordance with our mandate, we analysed the information that we had received from the administering Powers, in conformity with Article 73 (e) of the Charter, and the working papers drawn up by the Secretariat on each of the Territories. We also studied the statements made by the representatives of the Territories, by various officials, by petitioners and by non-governmental organizations. In June, at the end of its session, the Committee adopted a draft decision and nine draft resolutions by consensus. It also unanimously adopted a draft resolution on Puerto Rico.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">In parallel with that work, we have constantly stressed the need to work together with the Economic and Social Council. In that regard, the Council adopted a draft resolution last June on the implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies. In May 2002 in Fiji, the Special Committee held its regional seminar for the Pacific region. This was its opportunity to communicate with the representatives and the people of the Territories, and also to answer questions regarding its work. In particular, we stressed the Committee's desire to urge the administering Powers to develop decolonization plans in the form of special work programmes for each Territory. We also emphasized the fact that throughout the process we considered the opinions of the people of the Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Clearly, in order to make progress in carrying out its mandate, the Special Committee needs to be able to count on unreserved cooperation from the administering Powers. With this in mind, we should emphasize that in 2002 we were able to benefit from the constructive cooperation of New Zealand, which I will mention again later on.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">France also participated in our seminar. The United Kingdom and the United States attended some meetings informally and I would like to emphasize that the United Kingdom attended our regional seminar for the second year in a row. Our work relations with all of the administering Powers will, we hope, strengthen next year, so that we will be able to make constructive progress in our consideration of the needs and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">In this connection, a good example of what can be achieved when a constructive dialogue is created with an administering Power is provided by the work relations we have been cultivating with New Zealand regarding the future of Tokelau. This year, in 2002, we have continued to work side by side with the representatives of New Zealand and Tokelau in order to move forward with the work programme that is to lead to the decolonization of the Territory.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">Last summer, the chairman of the Special Committee made a visit at the invitation of the authorities of New Zealand and Tokelau. The report of this mission, which just appeared in document <a href="../pdf/A-AC.109-2002-31.pdf" class="nolink">A/AC.109/2002/31</a>, shows quite clearly that there is nothing more useful for our work than direct knowledge of what is happening in a Territory.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">Moreover, through its presence alone, the Visiting Mission of the United Nations to the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Tokelau and New Zealand has had a positive effect on the decolonization process by giving rise to a lively debate between the three parties.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">As the report of the Mission indicates, Tokelau and New Zealand maintain constructive relations and are making resolute progress towards the expansion of the autonomy of the Territory, while maintaining the quality of the public administration and the vitality of the economic development of the Territory. The result of the meetings in Wellington, devoted to setting a framework for the relations between the two countries, will be decisive from the standpoint of items still pending, for example, the circumstances in which New Zealand will provide administrative and economic assistance to the Territory, as well as assistance with security and defence, participation in regional and international affairs and the decolonization process itself.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">In this regard, the Mission states in its report that the population of Tokelau as a whole should be better informed of its options for self-determination, as well as their consequences. It recommends that Tokelau and New Zealand launch an education campaign and that they conduct a study of the various options and their consequences, under the auspices of and with the assistance of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">The case of Tokelau shows the considerable value of decolonization programmes and their importance for a given Territory when they are carried out with the goodwill of all parties involved.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">I ask for the support of the Assembly for the draft resolution in <a href="../pdf/A-57-L.52.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/L.52</a> on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which I shall now introduce. Beforehand, I would like to mention that the following countries have joined the list of sponsors: Côte d'Ivoire and Fiji.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa14">The text of the draft you have before you is nearly analogous to the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its last session. It recalls the proclamation of the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, and reaffirms that colonialism is incompatible with the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration on Decolonization of 1960. It also reaffirms the determination of the General Assembly to eliminate colonialism quickly and completely from the history of humankind.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa15">The General Assembly declares, once again, that it supports the aspirations of people subjected to colonial domination who wish to assert their right to self-determination, including independence, pursuant to United Nations resolutions on decolonization.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa16">The draft resolution asks the administering Powers to complete before the end of 2003 the preparation of constructive work programmes suitable to each Non-Self-Governing Territory, in order to facilitate the implementation of the mandate of the Special Committee, and the implementation of the relevant decolonization resolutions, especially those bearing on certain specific Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa17">In this regard, wording has been added in paragraph 7, new wording compared to previous texts. It welcomes the consultations between the Special Committee and the representatives of the New Zealand Government and the people of Tokelau with a view to advancing a programme of work on the question of Tokelau. It also welcomes the report of the United Nations Mission that I mentioned a moment ago.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa18">Subject to some minor editorial changes, paragraph 8 contains, as before, provisions on the work programme of the Special Committee. The Special Committee is asked to find specific ways to put an end to colonialism and to continue to monitor the manner in which Member States are implementing resolutions that the General Assembly has adopted in this regard; to continue to study the political, economic and social situation of Non-Self-Governing Territories; to conclude before the end of 2003 the preparation of a work programme in each and every case of a Non-Self-Governing Territory; and to continue to send visiting missions, organize seminars, mobilize support throughout the world for decolonization and finally, to commemorate every year a Week of Solidarity with the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa19">The draft resolution also contains paragraphs devoted specifically to economic activities, the exploitation of natural resources and military activities and arrangements within the Territories. The General Assembly urges Member States and specialized agencies to lend moral and material assistance to the people of these territories and requests that administering Powers make effective use of bilateral and multilateral assistance in the strengthening of the economies of those Territories. The text reaffirms the effectiveness of visiting missions to the Territories and asks the administering Powers to facilitate them. Those who have not officially taken part in the work of the Committee should do so at its 2003 session.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa20">In conclusion, the Secretary-General, specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system are asked to provide assistance to Non-Self Governing Territories, especially in the economic and social sphere, and that they continue to do so as appropriate after these Territories have exercised their right of self-determination, including independence.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa21">The text before the Committee is the culmination of consultations held by interested delegations in the spirit of accommodation and consensus. Therefore I urge delegations in the General Assembly to consider favourably the recommendations submitted to them by the Special Committee. This will enable it to continue its mission, which is to promote the rights and interests of the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa22">This Special Committee is determined to have a decisive influence on the assistance given to peoples of Non-Self Governing Territories so that they may be able to exercise their right to self-determination, pursuant to the resolutions of this Assembly. But the Committee cannot do so if we confine ourselves to adopting, year after year, the same resolutions without action. The Committee must carry out its mission and play an active role in decolonization by creating special work programmes and other diverse activities. It is absolutely necessary that administering Powers work along with it, in a constructive and transparent manner, in an attempt to achieve this noble objective. It is also absolutely necessary that the representatives of these Territories take part in these activities at every stage.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa23">Next year will be decisive for the actions undertaken by the Special Committee on Decolonization. Not only do we hope that our dialogue, which has just began with New Zealand on Tokelau, will continue, but we also hope to get into a relationship at the beginning of 2003 with other administering Powers, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, in order to draw up a work programme for each Territory. If we all wish to put an end to such a complex process as decolonization, all the parties involved must show special sincerity in the effort.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa24">Before concluding, on behalf of the Chairman of the Special Committee, may I thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the efficiency with which the Secretariat has provided us with intellectual and technical support throughout the session. The Chairman has also asked me to express his gratitude to the bureau of the Special Committee for the cooperation and support it gave him during the session. He has also instructed me to commend the effectiveness of the Secretariat staff dealing with decolonization.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa02">During this first part of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, the Fourth Committee held a total of 23 formal meetings. The Committee continued its practice of having an informal interactive meeting under agenda item 78, "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects". An open-ended working group established by the Committee under item 75, "International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space", also held a number of informal meetings.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa03">At this stage of its work, the Special Political and Decolonization Committee adopted 24 draft resolutions and 3 draft decisions, of which 11 draft resolutions and 3 draft decisions were adopted without a vote.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa07">In the draft resolution, the General Assembly would, among other things, endorse the work programmes of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and of its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and Legal Subcommittee. The Assembly would also agree that its 2004 review and appraisal of implementation of the recommendations of the 1999 Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III) should be conducted in plenary meetings under a separate agenda item entitled, "Review of the implementation of the recommendations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space". The General Assembly would also decide to accept, on an exceptional basis, Algeria's membership in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. On behalf of the Fourth Committee, I recommend this draft resolution to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa08">The third report, submitted under agenda item 76, "United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-520.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/520</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report of the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-13.pdf" class="nolink">document A/57/13</a>, as well as the report of the Working Group on the Financing of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-462.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/462</a>, and other relevant reports by the Secretary-General. Under this item, the Committee adopted seven draft resolutions related to various aspects of the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Their adoption would ensure the continuation of the important work of UNRWA in alleviating the sufferings of the Palestine refugees. These draft resolutions are contained in paragraph 23 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends the adoption of these draft resolutions to the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa09">The fourth report, submitted under agenda item 77, "Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-521.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/521</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report of the Special Committee concerning the protection and promotion of the human rights of the Palestinian people and other Arab inhabitants of the occupied territories, as well as other reports by the Secretary-General submitted under this item. Throughout the debate on this item, the activities of the Special Committee were widely supported and appreciated by many States. Meanwhile, some delegations also expressed concern about the nature of the activities of the Special Committee. Under this item, the Fourth Committee adopted five draft resolutions, which can be found in paragraph 24 of its report. The Fourth Committee recommends these draft resolutions to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa10">The fifth report, relating to agenda item 78, "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-522.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/522</a>. The Fourth Committee heard a comprehensive introductory statement by the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno and held a general debate under this item. It also held informal interactive discussions with the Under-Secretary-General and other senior officials of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Many of the issues raised during the general debate and the interactive discussions will be further considered by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations in its coming session early next year. One draft resolution was submitted under this item, as contained in paragraph 9 of the report. In the draft resolution, the General Assembly would designate 29 May as the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers. The Fourth Committee recommends this draft resolution to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa11">The sixth report, submitted under agenda item 79, "Questions relating to information", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-523.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/523</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report submitted by the Committee on Information, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-21.pdf" class="nolink">document A/57/21</a>, and the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/A-57-157.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/157</a>). The Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information, Mr. Shashi Tharoor, made a comprehensive introductory statement and responded to questions raised by delegations during the general debate on the ongoing and fundamental reorientation of the focus and structure of the Department of Public Information. The Fourth Committee adopted, without a vote, two draft resolutions and one draft decision, which are contained in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Committee's report.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa12">In draft resolution A, the Assembly would be asked, inter alia, to enhance regional efforts and cooperation among developing countries, as well as cooperation between developed and developing countries; to strengthen communication capacities; and to improve the media infrastructure and communication technology in the developing countries, especially in the areas of training and dissemination of information.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa13">In draft resolution B, the Assembly would, among other things, ask the Department of Public Information to maintain and improve its activities, through its reorientation, in the areas of special interest to developing countries and other countries with special needs, including countries in transition. The draft decision would also appoint Saudi Arabia to be the 99th member of the Committee on Information.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa14">The Special Political and Decolonization Committee thus recommends that the General Assembly adopt both draft resolutions and the draft decision.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa15">With regard to the cluster of items on Non-Self-Governing Territories and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which includes agenda items 80, 81, 82, 83, 12 and 19, the Fourth Committee considered these items together. The Committee had one single general debate on the cluster of items and heard three representatives and 16 petitioners from various Non-Self-Governing Territories. Under those items, the General Assembly has before it five reports.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa16">The report submitted under agenda item 80, "Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-524.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/524</a>. The draft resolution submitted under this item appears in paragraph seven of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa17">The report relating to agenda items 81 and 19, "Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories" and "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-525.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/525</a>. Under these two items, the Fourth Committee adopted one draft resolution entitled "Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories" and one draft decision entitled "Military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration". They are contained in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the report, respectively. The Fourth Committee recommends this draft resolution and the draft decision to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa18">The report relating to agenda item 82, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations" and item 12, "Report of the Economic and Social Council", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-526.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/526</a>. In paragraph 7 of the report, the Fourth Committee recommends one draft resolution to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa19">The report relating to agenda item 83, "Offers by Member States of study and training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-527.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/527</a>. Under this item, the Fourth Committee recommends one draft resolution, which is contained in paragraph six of the report, for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa20">The report submitted under agenda item 19, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-528.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/528</a>, which contains the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to specific Territories not covered by other agenda items.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa21">In this context, the Fourth Committee adopted four draft resolutions and one draft decision. The draft resolutions on the "Question of Western Sahara", "Question of New Caledonia", "Question of Tokelau", the consolidated omnibus draft resolution concerning the eleven territories, as well as the draft decision on the "Question of Gibraltar", were all adopted without a vote by the Fourth Committee. The four draft resolutions are contained in paragraph 25 of the report and the draft decision is contained in paragraph 26. The Fourth Committee recommends that the General Assembly adopt these draft resolutions and the draft decision.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa22">Before concluding, I should like to stress the high level of cooperation prevailing in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee. This enabled it to fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by the Assembly and to complete its work effectively and constructively despite time constraints occasioned by the changes in its work schedule.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa23">I should also like to express, on behalf of the Bureau of the Fourth Committee, our profound appreciation to those delegations that coordinated the drafting of the resolutions adopted by the Committee. I should also like to thank all delegations that participated in our efforts to reach consensus on many draft resolutions and decisions.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa24">I should like to pay particular tribute here to the Chairman of the Fourth Committee, Mr. Graham Maitland of South Africa, whose knowledge and experience in multilateral forums, enhanced by his consummate diplomatic skills, enabled the Committee to consider in depth all the agenda items allocated to it by the General Assembly. This was particularly important given the wide-ranging and often difficult issues assigned to this Committee. The Vice-Chairpersons -- Ambassador  Margaret  Hughes  Ferrari of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Ms. Debra Price of Canada and Mr. Mansour Ayyad Al-Otaibi of Kuwait -- with whom I had the pleasure of working, also contributed to the successful conclusion of the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa25">I should also like to place on record our appreciation for the able and efficient cooperation provided by Ms. Lesley Wilkinson, the Secretary of the Committee, and her very competent team from the Secretariat. It is through their efforts that the work of the Committee always proceeded smoothly and in an atmosphere of genuine cordiality and efficiency. We are indeed grateful to them for ensuring that we completed our work successfully.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa26">I now have the honour to submit to the General Assembly for its consideration and adoption the recommendations of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, contained in the reports contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-57-518.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/518</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-57-528.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/528</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa03">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa04">May I also remind delegations that, in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa05">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified to the contrary in advance. This means that, where recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we will proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ovia</span> <span class="nation">Papua New Guinea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk08-pa01">As everyone in this Assembly is well aware, Papua New Guinea's policy on the inalienable rights of all peoples to self-determination, including those of the Palestinian people, remains firm and unwavering. However, we also believe that this inalienable right must be exercised through peaceful means and without any duress and violence.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk08-pa02">For the Middle East region, we believe that the two States of Israel and Palestine have a right to exist as sovereign States side by side and within secured borders. The statement of Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, to the General Assembly during the general debate this year further reaffirmed that position.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk08-pa03">The current state of violence on both sides of the Middle East conflict cannot and must not be condoned by the international community, including Papua New Guinea. We condemn the violent methods employed by some amongst the Palestinian population to achieve these aims. We appeal to them to cease these methods and to take the peaceful route of dialogue and negotiations. At the same time, we call for fair treatment of innocent Palestinian people by the Israeli army in its attempts to catch those individuals, organizations and leaders responsible for the violence.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk08-pa04">The delegation of Papua New Guinea has in recent times further observed that many resolutions on Palestine and the Middle East question are not fair and balanced. They condemn Israel for taking action to protect its citizens and bring to justice those responsible for taking the lives of innocent people, including children. At the same time, the resolutions say little or nothing about Palestinian suicide bombing and other methods used to try to send a message and/or achieve the intended goal of freedom.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk08-pa05">Papua New Guinea, like others in our subregion, believes that dialogue and negotiations with our rivals and even those who do not necessarily agree with us are always the best way forward. We believe therefore that peace and harmony will come to the Middle East region by very hard and constructive discussions and decisions. We call on both Israel and the Palestinian authorities to come to the negotiating table to discuss their differences and the difficult questions.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk08-pa06">Papua New Guinea will therefore vote in favour of most of the draft resolutions, but abstain in the voting on others.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk08-pa03">At the same time, my delegation wishes to recall that, in the particular colonial situation presented by the question of the Malvinas Islands, the principle of territorial integrity applies in order to prevent any attempt to disrupt the national unity and the territorial integrity of the Argentine Republic, in conformity with resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2625 (XXV) and with the subsequent resolutions of the Assembly and of the Special Committee on decolonization on that question.

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Marsh</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk13-pa01">Unfortunately, the United States cannot support <a href="../pdf/A-57-L.52.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/57/L.52</a>, on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. By adopting a narrow definition of decolonization, the draft resolution fails to take into account the complex reality of Non-Self-Governing Territories. For the United States, the very term "non-self-governing" seems inappropriate for those who can establish their own constitution, elect their own public officers, have representation in Washington and choose their own economic path. One of the territories under our administration, for example, held elections just last month.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk13-pa02">In particular, the United States disagrees with the draft resolution's request for studies on the implications of each of the options of self-determination for the Non-Self-Governing Territories. We believe that United Nations funding would be better allocated elsewhere. The United States also disagrees with the draft resolution's contention that the mere presence of military activities and bases in the Non-Self-Governing Territories is harmful to the rights and interests of the peoples of the territories. We do not support the notion that administering Powers do not have the right to take actions in accordance with their national security interests.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk13-pa03">Furthermore, with regard to the draft resolution recommended in Part III, chapter XIII, section G of <a href="../pdf/A-57-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/57/23</a>, on dissemination of information on decolonization, I should like to say that the United States finds that it burdens the Secretariat of the United Nations and its resources unreasonably.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk13-pa04">The United States fully supports countries that choose independence, and we are proud to welcome them as equal and sovereign partners. Not all territories choose independence, however, and we equally support their right to a full measure of self-government, including the rights to integration and to free association. The world encompasses a variety of peoples, places and political circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk13-pa05">That richness does not allow for just one path. The United States believes that a single standard should not be applied to every territory, and we call upon all Member States to respect the choices made by residents of Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Harrison</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa01">I should like to explain the United Kingdom's votes on the resolutions on the dissemination of information on decolonization and on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. As Members will have seen, the United Kingdom voted against both those resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa02">With regard to the resolution on the dissemination of information on decolonization, the United Kingdom remains of the view that the obligation that this text places on the Secretariat to publicize decolonization issues represents an unwarranted drain on the scarce resources of the United Nations. The resolution is therefore unacceptable to the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa03">The United Kingdom continues to find some elements of the text of the resolution on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to be unacceptable. Those elements include, but are not limited to, paragraph 12, which calls on the Administering Powers to eliminate the remaining military bases in the Non-Self-Governing Territories. This language is drawn from <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-525.pdf" class="nolink">decision 57/525</a>, on military activities, which we also voted against this year.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa04">Despite our negative votes on those resolutions, the United Kingdom delegation remains sincerely committed to furthering the process of informal dialogue with the Special Committee of 24 over the coming year.</p>
