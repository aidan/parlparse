	<p id="docA52PV69-pg001-bk03-pa01">Before turning to the items on our agenda for this afternoon, I would like to recall that today is Human Rights Day; by commemorating this international Human Rights Day, we mark the beginning of the fiftieth anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg001-bk03-pa02">Promotion of human rights has been at the core of United Nations activities since the inception of our Organization. At the very outset the United Nations Charter reaffirmed faith in "fundamental human rights" and in the "dignity and worth of the human person". Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights only three years after the establishment of the United Nations reflected a common understanding that fundamental freedoms and respect for human dignity provide the most solid foundation for peace, democracy, development and fruitful international cooperation in every field of human activity.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg001-bk03-pa03">As we look back today at the United Nations work in the field of human rights, we can be proud of what has been accomplished, in particular in standard-setting and human rights advocacy. We cannot pretend, however, that the gap has been bridged between aspirations and achievements. Arbitrary arrests, torture, imprisonment without trial, exploitation of children, denial of equal rights to women, discrimination on the basis of race -- these violations of human rights continue to be a sad reality in today's world and to call for our urgent and decisive action.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg001-bk03-pa04">As we are launching today the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let us renew our commitment to the ideals enshrined in this historic document. Let us make sure that 1998 becomes a milestone in the long struggle for the achievement of one of the most noble purposes of the United Nations.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span><span class="nation">Syria</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to present to the General Assembly for its consideration the report of the Special Committee covering its work during 1997, which is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-52-23.pdf">A/52/23</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa02">The report is submitted in accordance with paragraph 11 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-146.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 51/146</a> on the implementation of the Declaration, by which the Assembly requested the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration; to carry out those actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that had not yet exercised their right to self-determination; and, in particular, to formulate specific proposals for the elimination of the remaining manifestations of colonialism.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa03">At its forty-sixth session the General Assembly, by adopting <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/181</a>, entitled "International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism", and the plan of action, mandated the Special Committee to undertake a series of activities during the Decade including organizing during the Decade seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific regions alternately.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa04">During this year the Special Committee was able to discharge the tasks entrusted to it by the Assembly and to submit appropriate recommendations on all the items referred to it for consideration and report, by meeting between January and July and by holding extensive consultations among its members throughout the year.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa05">Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-146.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 51/146</a>, the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and to promoting the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa06">In addition, the Special Committee submitted recommendations specifically relating to economic and other activities that affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories; military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration; the implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations; and information transmitted under Article 73 e of the Charter. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of Members to the fact that the text of the draft resolution on economic and other activities is a result of the consultations between the Special Committee of 24 and the European Union, and has been updated in order to fully reflect the realities and a general understanding among Member States concerning decolonization.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa07">During the year, the Special Committee devoted considerable attention to the decolonization of the small island Territories. In that connection, the Special Committee was especially mindful of the fact that the United Nations visiting missions had provided an effective means of assessing and ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of those Territories regarding their future status. Accordingly, it once again stressed the importance of dispatching such missions to colonial Territories in order to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration. In that respect, the Committee will continue to seek the full cooperation of the administering Powers so that visiting missions to Territories under their administration can be undertaken.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa08">On the question of publicity to be given to the work of the United Nations in the field of decolonization, and as reflected in chapter III of its report, the Committee again reiterated the importance of effecting the widest possible dissemination of information on decolonization as an instrument for furthering the purposes and principles of the Charter and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and for mobilizing world public opinion in support of the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories in their efforts to achieve self-determination, freedom and independence.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa09">Bearing in mind the important role being played by non-governmental organizations in the decolonization process and the dissemination of information on the situation in all the remaining small island Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Special Committee requested the Department of Political Affairs and the Department of Public Information to continue their cooperation with those organizations in the dissemination of information on decolonization issues.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa10">I have the honour to introduce for adoption by the General Assembly the draft resolution on dissemination of information on decolonization, contained in paragraph 10, chapter III, Part II of document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-52-23.pdf">A/52/23</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa11">During the year, in the light of the constructive results achieved and in keeping with related decisions of the Assembly, the Committee decided to continue to maintain close contact with the organizations concerned and to participate in the conferences arranged by those organizations, as well as by other United Nations bodies. The objective of those contacts was to facilitate the effective implementation of the decisions of the various United Nations bodies and to foster cooperation between the specialized agencies and those regional organizations in their assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories in those regions.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa12">I should like to draw members' attention to the proposals outlined in section J of chapter I, entitled "Future work", which, the Committee hopes, will meet with the Assembly's approval in order to enable the Committee to proceed with the effective discharge of the task that remains to be completed. It should be noted that, during 1997, the Special Committee undertook important decisions aimed at streamlining its work and increasing its transparency. We have integrated the Subcommittee with the Special Committee. We have also abolished the Working Group, whose functions are now being performed by the Committee's Bureau, which has become open-ended.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa13">The Special Committee recommended that the General Assembly renew its appeal to the administering Powers concerned to take all necessary steps for the implementation of the Declaration and the relevant United Nations resolutions, in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. In that connection, the Special Committee, bearing in mind the useful results achieved as a consequence of the active participation of the administering Powers, recommended that the Assembly again request the administering Powers to resume formal cooperation or continue to cooperate with the Special Committee in the discharge of its mandate and, in particular, to participate actively in its work relating to the Territories under their respective administration.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa14">The General Assembly may also wish to renew its appeal to all States, the specialized agencies and other organizations within the United Nations system to meet various requests addressed to them by the United Nations in its resolutions on the question of decolonization.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa15">The Special Committee devoted considerable time to discussing the question of the decolonization programme in the United Nations system. It is gratifying that the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in his letter addressed to the Chairman of the Special Committee of 24, as contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-531.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/531</a>, reaffirmed his commitment to the full implementation of subprogramme 1.6 of the medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001. We hope that this commitment of the Secretary-General will be fully implemented, without any delay, and that the stand-alone Decolonization Unit in the Department of Political Affairs will be adequately staffed. This would assist the Special Committee in continuing efficiently to discharge its noble mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa16">On behalf of the Committee, I commend the report to the attention of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa17">Before concluding, allow me to express to all the members of the Special Committee and, in particular, to Ambassador Utula Utuoc Samana of Papua New Guinea, Chairman of the Special Committee, Ambassador Bruno Rodríguez Parilla of Cuba and Ambassador Moctar Ouane of Mali, Vice-Chairmen, my deep gratitude for their cooperation and support.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg002-bk02-pa18">I also thank Mr. Amer Araim, the Secretary of the Special Committee, and his colleagues and other associated members of the Secretariat for their assistance, which facilitated my task as Rapporteur.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Ovia</span><span class="nation">Papua New Guinea</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa01">As this is my maiden address to this Assembly, it gives me great pleasure to address the General Assembly on behalf of my Permanent Representative, Ambassador Utula Samana, Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa02">I am speaking today to introduce the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.64.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.64</a> on the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which is sponsored by Côte d'Ivoire, Cuba, Fiji, Grenada, Indonesia, Mali, Saint Lucia, the Syrian Arab Republic and my own country, Papua New Guinea.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa03">After some consultations, the sponsors have agreed to revise operative paragraph 15 to reflect some of the concerns that have been expressed to us.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa04">While adhering to the principles inherent in the Declaration, the Special Committee has in recent years considered the question of decolonization in a more realistic and pragmatic manner, taking into account the prevailing international situation, as well as recognizing the specific conditions in the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa05">It is universally recognized that decolonization is one of the greatest achievements of our Organization. The vast majority of the States here today are here because of the Special Committee. Should this world body, after having achieved so much in the field of decolonization, ignore the plight of the peoples of the remaining 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories? Should we, at this juncture in the work of the United Nations, ignore our moral responsibilities to assist the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories to have the opportunity to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, in conformity with the international legal norms we are obligated to uphold? The answer is definitely no.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa06">On the basis of the existing mandate of the United Nations and the moral responsibilities incumbent upon us, the agenda on decolonization deserves adequate recognition and priority with respect to the defence of the rights of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. I am sure that the General Assembly will continue to stand firm, as it has always done, in fulfilling its obligations in the field of decolonization.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa07">The peoples of the remaining 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, through their elected representatives, have consistently and rightfully called upon the United Nations to maintain vigilance and, specifically, to urge the international community to focus particularly on the social, economic and political developments of their Territories in a manner that will facilitate their progress towards self-determination.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa08">The international community, and the administering Powers in particular, have an obligation under the legal and customary norms of the United Nations to implement the goals of the Declaration. Where administering Powers have cooperated in the work of the Special Committee, both in terms of participating in its formal sessions and in allowing visiting missions to visit Territories to ensure transparency in the implementation of the requirements of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, much progress has been achieved in assisting the constitutional, political and economic development of the Territories, thereby enabling the peoples of the Territories to gain greater autonomy and responsibility in governing themselves.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa09">Some have argued that, given the changing international climate and the difficulties faced by these Territories, complete independence may not be viable and that therefore the question of decolonization may be a non-priority, and that the international community may be wasting time and energy in considering these issues. However, the great majority of the Assembly is committed to seeing to it that the goals of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism are achieved by the year 2000.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa10">It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories -- most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size, isolation, vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources, including problems of accessibility to international credit markets -- that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa11">The Special Committee is fully aware of the impediments that may limit the options for full and complete independence, but they should not therefore be used as a rationale for maintaining colonial situations. They should not be used as an excuse to undermine and deprive the peoples of the Territories concerned of their ability to gain their rightful political status and autonomy, to control and develop their resources and to pursue development goals and objectives suited to their political, economic and cultural interests. The Special Committee, however, made serious efforts, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1541 (XV), to look at options that are more suited to responding to the circumstances of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories. This would not have been possible without the product of the work of the regional seminars.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa12">The principles inherent in the Declaration are specific and clear on the question of the right of peoples freely to determine their political status in accordance with their own wishes. Within the framework of the Declaration, the Special Committee is entrusted with the task of continuously seeking suitable ways and means of implementing requirements of the Declaration, with the cooperation of the administering Powers.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa13">The Special Committee has continued to carry out its mandate judiciously and faithfully. Over the years it has diligently pursued its task of reviewing the situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories, hearing petitioners, sending visiting missions to the Territories, disseminating information on decolonization with a view to mobilizing public opinion and making suggestions and recommendations on the progress and the extent of the implementation of the Declaration and reporting to the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa14">This noble mission of eradicating colonialism remains unaccomplished. The Special Committee has constantly reviewed its approaches and rationalized its methods of work, improving its efficiency and making adjustments where appropriate in response to the changing circumstances and in line with the new developments in the international community.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa15">In its endeavour to keep up with changing circumstances and situations, the Special Committee, however, has remained conscious of its ultimate responsibility for safeguarding and protecting the interests and welfare of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, guided by their specific needs and aspirations.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa16">The adoption by the General Assembly in 1991 of a Plan of Action for the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism gave further impetus to the work of the United Nations in the process of eradicating colonialism. The International Decade's specific Plan of Action is aimed at ushering in a world free of colonialism in the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa17">While the General Assembly has repeatedly reaffirmed that such factors as population size and remoteness should not prevent the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories from freely exercising their rights to self-determination, the Special Committee is cognizant of the fact that complete decolonization by the year 2000 will require innovative and realistic solutions that can be achieved only with the cooperation and active participation of the administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee. The Special Committee will continue to open its doors to dialogue and consultation in order to reach consensus and cooperation with the administering Powers, which we all believe are critical in facilitating speedy progress towards achieving the objectives of decolonization.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa18">However, such dialogue and consultation must have a clear objective of serving the interests of the peoples concerned, interests that the international community is obligated to uphold. Dialogue and consultation must focus on how best we can collectively pursue the process of decolonization within the framework of the legal and customary norms of the United Nations, and must not be aimed at redefining and shifting basic principles to suit other interests that may be contrary to the wishes of the peoples.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa19">It is extremely important that the cooperation between the Special Committee and the administering Powers play a critical role in the search for specific measures that would promote the kind of development that will eventually enable the peoples of those Territories to exercise their right to self-determination.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa20">The sponsors of this draft resolution are concerned about the attempts to prevent the implementation of a decision of the Secretary-General contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-531.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/531</a>, thereby diminishing the decolonization programme in the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa21">The recently published document <a href="../pdf/A-52-303-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/303/Add.1</a> does not reflect the commitment of the Secretary-General regarding the full implementation of subprogramme 1.6 of the medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001. It is therefore our understanding that the implementation of the medium-term plan entails that the stand-alone Decolonization Unit be maintained in the Department of Political Affairs and that it be viable and properly staffed -- including by the Secretary of the Special Committee and officers at the P-5 and P-4 levels. At this critical juncture of the global efforts to eradicate colonialism by the year 2000, the Decolonization Unit should be availed of all the resources required by the programme, in accordance with the medium-term plan, which without any doubt would enhance our progress towards a world free from colonialism and better for all.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa22">In conclusion, I should like to propose that the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, which is the same as the previous year's, with the minor revisions that I will present. And in the light of the changing mood to improve cooperation and consultations between all parties, I should like to urge that we adopt this draft resolution without a vote.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa23">The revisions that I will introduce refer to operative paragraph 15 of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.64.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.64</a>. The revisions are as follows:</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa24">"<i>Welcomes </i>the decision of the Secretary-General on 27 October 1997:</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa25">(a) that the substantive responsibilities for the Decolonization Programme will be maintained in the Department of Political Affairs;</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa26">(b) to establish a stand-alone Decolonization Unit with the necessary resources to provide substantive input for the work of the Special Committee of 24;</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa27">(c) that the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services will be responsible for the technical secretariat servicing relating to the Decolonization Programme, as outlined in his letter of 17 March 1997;</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa28">(d) and his commitment to implement subprogramme 1.6 of the medium-term plan, 1998-2001".</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg003-bk02-pa29">These revisions are necessary because of the difficulties that some delegations encountered during the consultations.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV69-pg006-bk02-pa01">The decolonization of peoples under colonial domination is one of the areas in which the United Nations has accomplished praiseworthy work. Since the adoption in 1960 of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, many States have attained independence and swelled the ranks of our Organization.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg006-bk02-pa02">But we cannot remain satisfied with what has been achieved so far. We are commemorating today the forty-ninth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which regards the right to self-determination as an inalienable human right. But regrettably, as we stand today on the threshold of the twenty-first century, many peoples are being denied that right. Year after year, dozens of petitioners come to seek the assistance and help of the United Nations in their struggle to exercise the right to self-determination and independence, and we cannot close our eyes to this fact.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg006-bk02-pa03">We note with satisfaction the dialogue that took place last year between the members of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee and certain administering Powers. This is a positive sign, but the dialogue must be established on a formal basis, and its results must yield tangible benefits for the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg006-bk02-pa04">The United Nations has a responsibility to discharge in this area, and the machinery available to us for this purpose is the Decolonization Committee. It is for that reason that we attach key importance to strengthening the Decolonization Committee and to the need to endow it with the resources it vitally needs for its work.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg006-bk02-pa05">The report submitted to us by the Committee is clear and precise. It is very important to promote its activities by means, among other things, of holding seminars on decolonization issues and by sending visiting missions to the Non-Self-Governing Territories, making it possible to obtain firsthand information concerning the real state of affairs there.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg006-bk02-pa06">Decolonization activities, by their very nature, are essentially political. For this reason, we note with satisfaction the Secretary-General's decision to keep the Decolonization Unit in the Department of Political Affairs and to provide it with all the necessary resources, in accordance with the medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg006-bk02-pa07">In order to achieve this objective and to make the work of the United Nations in the area of decolonization genuinely effective, the human and financial resources earmarked for the execution of the activities of sub-programme 1.6 of the medium-term plan, as well as those associated with the activities of the Decolonization Committee, must be retained in the Department of Political Affairs. The Cuban delegation accordingly hopes that a clear-cut decision to this effect will be taken in the context of the negotiations to be held on the programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa01">It is my pleasant duty to present to the General Assembly the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) for its consideration and approval.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa02">This year the Assembly allocated agenda items 12, 18, and 84 to 94 -- that is 13 agenda items -- to the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) for its consideration. The Committee held 25 meetings and concluded its work on Wednesday, 26 November 1997, thereby responding to the Assembly's appeal that it conduct the work of this session in a new spirit of rationalization and in a way making better use of the Organization's conference resources and facilities. This result was possible thanks to various factors including the spirit of open cooperation and conciliation that prevailed in the Committee.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa03">It is my pleasure now to introduce the following reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) to the General Assembly for its consideration and approval.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa04">Under agenda item 18, entitled "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", the Fourth Committee recommends, in paragraph 31 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-613.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/613</a>, the adoption of 16 draft resolutions. In this connection, I wish to draw attention to a minor technical error in that document. The heading "Consideration of proposals", which precedes paragraph 11, should be enumerated "II", and the following line, "Draft resolution A/C.452/L.4 and Rev.1", should be enumerated "A".</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa05">Under agenda item 84, entitled "Effects of atomic radiation", the Fourth Committee recommends, in paragraph 8 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-614.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/614</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa06">Under agenda item 85, entitled "International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space", the Fourth Committee recommends, in paragraph 11 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-615.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/615</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa07">Under agenda item 86, entitled "United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East", the Fourth Committee recommends, in paragraph 29 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-616.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/616</a>, the adoption of seven draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa08">Under agenda item 87, entitled "Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories", the Fourth Committee recommends, in paragraph 16 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-617.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/617</a>, the adoption of five draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa09">Under agenda item 88, entitled "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects", the Fourth Committee recommends, in paragraph 9 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-618.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/618</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa10">Under agenda item 89, entitled "Questions relating to information", the Fourth Committee recommends, in paragraphs 8 and 9 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-619.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/619</a>, the adoption of two draft resolutions and one draft decision.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa11">Under agenda item 90, entitled "Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 <i>e </i>of the Charter of the United Nations", the Fourth Committee recommends, in paragraph 7 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-620.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/620</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa12">Under agenda items 91 and 18, entitled respectively "Activities of foreign economic and other interests which impede the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in territories under colonial domination" and "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", the Special Political and Decolonization Committee recommends, in paragraphs 10 and 11 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-621.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/621</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution and one draft decision.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa13">Under agenda items 92 and 12, entitled respectively "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations" and "Report of the Economic and Social Council", the Special Political and Decolonization Committee recommends, in paragraph 7 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-622.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/622</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa14">Under agenda item 93, entitled "Offers by Member States of study and training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories", the Fourth Committee recommends, in paragraph 6 of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-623.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/623</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa15">In connection with agenda item 94, entitled "The situation in the occupied territories of Croatia", the Fourth Committee, on the recommendation of the Chairman and in order to meet the wishes of the sponsor of the item, decided not to take any action on that agenda item. In accordance with that decision, this agenda item will not be included in the agenda of future sessions of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa16">That concludes my presentation of the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee). I may have unduly taxed the patience of the Assembly, but I hope that delegations will agree that the work and the achievements of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee at this session deserved an item-by-item presentation, no matter how sketchy.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa17">Before I leave the rostrum, I should like to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to all those who contributed to the success of the work of the Committee at the fifty-second session. First of all, I wish to congratulate all representatives and colleagues in the Committee, who demonstrated their high professional skills and their willingness to cooperate in reaching mutually satisfactory solutions, and who made it possible for the Committee to carry out its work in a very constructive and efficient manner.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa18">I should like to address a special word of thanks to the Chairman of the Committee, His Excellency Ambassador Machivenyika Tobias Mapuranga, whose diplomatic skills and patience helped the Committee to conduct its deliberations efficiently and in a businesslike manner. The Chairman was assisted by two able Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Petru Dumitriu and Mr. Ravjaa Mounkhou, with whom, in my capacity as Rapporteur, I had the honour to serve in the Bureau of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa19">I should also like to express my appreciation to the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, Mr. Jin Yongjian, for his valuable contribution, and to the Director of the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs Division, Mr. Vadim Perfiliev, for his assistance and contribution.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa20">I also take great pleasure in warmly thanking the Committee Secretary, Mr. Mohammad Sattar, whose ability and vast experience contributed greatly to the successful and timely conclusion of our work. I should also like to thank all the staff of the secretariat of the Committee, who provided such dedicated services to the Committee and who made a real contribution to the smooth functioning of the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg007-bk03-pa21">Last but not least, my thanks go also to all the interpreters, translators, conference officers and documents officers who contributed to the work of the Committee and to its successful conclusion.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV69-pg009-bk13-pa01">My delegation, which is chairing the Arab Group this month, wishes to make a statement in explanation of vote on draft resolution I, on assistance to Palestine refugees. Despite the fact that we will vote in favour of the draft resolution, we would like to express a reservation about the fourth preambular paragraph, which refers to the Multilateral Working Group on Refugees in the context of the Middle East peace process. This reservation is based on the decision of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers to suspend Arab participation in the multilateral committees until tangible progress is achieved in the peace process, particularly on the bilateral tracks, and until the Israeli Government has fulfilled its commitment to implement the signed agreements and obligations already subscribed to in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and other resolutions.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg009-bk13-pa02">We have strenuously endeavoured to reach agreement on this issue with the sponsors of the draft resolution. However, regrettably, the sponsors insisted on maintaining the paragraph as it was, thus ignoring the Arab position on this issue. As the Arab countries are directly concerned with this question, we had hoped that this paragraph would reflect Arab concerns as well as the fact that these Committees had not met since the stalling and freezing of the peace process because of the behaviour, the measures and the policy adopted by the present Israeli Government, which do not contribute to the achievement of peace, security and stability in the area.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg009-bk13-pa03">Although we highly appreciate European efforts and their continuous support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, we regret that they have not taken into account the positions of the parties directly concerned.

	<p id="docA52PV69-pg016-bk04-pa01">It will be extremely difficult to express the depth of our appreciation to the Member States that sponsored and voted in favour of the draft resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan, whether in the Fourth Committee or in this Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg016-bk04-pa02">This is particularly so since voting in favour of the draft resolution by such an overwhelming majority constitutes a clear message which coincides with today's United Nations commemoration of the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, presided over by you, Mr. President.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg016-bk04-pa03">And it is particularly so in view of the fact that Israel continues to occupy Arab territories, including Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon. The will of the majority in the international Organization is an embodiment of world democracy and is therefore an absolutely clear message addressed to Israel, a message that condemns Israel's violations of the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and requests Israel, as the occupying Power, to put an end to its imposition of Israeli identity cards and nationality on the Syrian citizens in the Golan and to end other repressive measures against the Syrian population there.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg016-bk04-pa04">To support this resolution is indeed to support human rights, which are the basis of our humanity, particularly in view of the fact that human rights are universal and comprehensive and allow human beings to enjoy their true humanity. The struggle for international human rights is a struggle against all forms of oppression and injustice at all times and in all places.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg016-bk04-pa05">It is indeed considered a struggle against colonialism and apartheid. This is what was stated and confirmed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his message today on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="docA52PV69-pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Gomersall</span><span class="nation">United Kingdom</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg024-bk02-pa01">My delegation regrets that it has again found it necessary to vote against the draft resolutions on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and on the dissemination of information on decolonization -- draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.64.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.64</a> and the draft resolution contained in paragraph 10 of part II, chapter III of document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-52-23.pdf">A/52/23</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg024-bk02-pa02">The latter text does contain elements which, as an administering Power, the United Kingdom can welcome. In particular, we note the recognition that self-determination does not automatically equate to independence and that there are other options available. However, my delegation believes that, at a time of ever more acute financial crisis in the United Nations, placing an obligation on the Department of Political Affairs and the Department of Public Information to publicize decolonization issues represents a serious waste of scarce resources. The basic aim of this resolution is therefore unacceptable to the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg024-bk02-pa03">This delegation also regrets that the resolution on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples continues to contain many egregious examples of language and assumptions that do not reflect the present situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories. We do not accept that the presence of military bases could in any way constitute an obstacle to the granting of independence or impede their inhabitants from expressing their views on self-determination. Similarly, the text of the resolution appears to accuse the administering Powers of economic exploitation and even of violations of basic human rights. These are claims which we wholeheartedly reject and are without any foundation.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg024-bk02-pa04">My delegation also finds unacceptable the continued references to colonialism, colonial rule and colonial countries. The presence of such language in this text is all the more regrettable because it is so clearly out of step with the major improvements in other resolutions on decolonization issues over the last year. I am thinking particularly of the so-called omnibus resolution, which has been adopted by consensus for the second year running, and the resolution on economic activities, on which many delegations have been able to change to a more favourable position this year. This delegation's hope would be that the drafters of the two resolutions before us will follow these examples in the future.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg024-bk02-pa05">My delegation joins with others in recognizing that decolonization is one of the great success stories of the first 50 years of the United Nations and that the principles upheld by this Organization have an enduring validity. We pay tribute to those who have worked successfully and with goodwill in this field, and will continue to fulfil our obligations with regard to the United Kingdom's dependent Territories.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg024-bk02-pa06">I have already referred to the recent welcome signs of flexibility and compromise shown by the Special Committee of 24. However, the United Kingdom continues to take a different view of the need for a decolonization programme on the current scale. In our view, this is wholly disproportionate to the real remaining problems. The United Nations has more pressing goals, affecting vastly greater numbers of the world's population, and more relevant to today's needs. The activities and structure of this Organization should reflect the world's present and future priorities and not those of the past.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV69-pg024-bk02-pa07">In conclusion, the two resolutions submitted to this General Assembly do nothing to advance the wishes and interests of the peoples of the remaining dependent Territories, which remain the foundation of my Government's policy towards them.</p>
