<span class="speaker" name="President Portillo Cabrera" nation="" language="Spanish">
	President Portillo Cabrera
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa01">Let me first condemn the monstrous attack on the people and the Government of our host country. In condemning it in the strongest possible terms, we declare ourselves in full solidarity with the people and the Government of the United States, the families of each and every one of the victims, whatever his or her nationality, and the residents of this great city of New York. We also associate ourselves unreservedly with the resolutions adopted last month by the Assembly and the Security Council. We will carry on in our commitment to the elimination of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa02">Before taking up our Government programme and the fulfilment of the Peace Agreements, and our position on certain of the items on the agenda for this session, I wish to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I have no doubt that your well-proven capabilities and your recognized wisdom will enable you to bring our deliberations to a fully successful outcome.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa03">I wish further to join the representatives who have taken the floor before me in commending the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan for his wise leadership. We hail his well-deserved re-election and rejoice at the recognition that both he and the Organization have received, through the award of the Nobel Peace Prize.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa04">I come, like many of those gathered here, from a small country that mirrors the grave problems facing today's world. Today we still do not enjoy the major benefits of the great scientific and technological advances, and we still suffer from great social inequalities. Ours is a small country that is doing its best to attain peace and democracy -- a country that believes in the rewards of economic freedom, but also in social justice. It is a country that has opened itself up to the world, although the world has perhaps not opened itself up reciprocally in the same way. It is a country that works and produces by making great efforts but that, in the present circumstances, is receiving less and less for those efforts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa05">In this context, our contribution to world peace and democracy is diminished to the same extent that inequality, social injustice and poverty imperil our peace and our democracy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa06">Today the struggle against terrorism is the struggle against inequality in international economic relations; it is the struggle against ignorance, injustice, discrimination, intolerance, exclusion and poverty. There will be no peace if we do not eradicate these scourges. A peace that goes hand in hand with inequality, poverty and injustice is a bad peace. And let us not forget that a bad peace is worse than war.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa07">We are making strenuous efforts to advance in implementing our own Peace Agreements, which coincide with our Government programme. The time that has elapsed since I addressed the Millennium Summit has witnessed intensive activities. I can point to significant progress, but I must also admit to some setbacks, which are due primarily to an unfavourable international environment, which has affected the economy in an extremely adverse way. I draw attention to this situation, because full compliance with the commitments contained in the Peace Agreements would be far easier in a context of economic growth than in the framework of serious fiscal restrictions and increasing demands on the Government.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa08">On a different matter, I would like to comment briefly on the United Nations presence in Guatemala. I wish to reiterate how much we appreciate the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA). We trust that its mandate will be extended until the end of 2003 so that we can in a progressive and orderly way transfer its functions both to national institutions and, wherever possible, to the United Nations programmes and agencies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa09">As far as our international relations are concerned, I would like to mention the significant progress made in the process of finding a peaceful resolution to the historical dispute between ourselves and Belize. In keeping with the principles of peaceful settlement of disputes between States, we have confirmed with deeds our commitment to dialogue as the way of settling disputes. The commission of facilitators appointed last year, within the framework of the regional organization to which both States belong, the Organization of American States, will soon submit its report. Its fundamental aim is to work out and prepare courses of action to make progress in resolving the dispute.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa10">We reiterate our firm support for Central American integration and our commitment to the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean. Our Government has supported major initiatives in the area of regional and subregional integration, and is working hard to overcome problems left over from age-old border disputes in Central America.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa11">As to our position on other international conflicts, we voice the hope that the differences or divisions that persist between fraternal peoples in the Middle East, Asia and Africa will yield to resolution peacefully through dialogue. I also wish to take this opportunity to reiterate before this Assembly our concern over the situation of the 23 million citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan, whose aspiration to be represented in international organizations has not yet been fully satisfied. The Central American countries in general, and Guatemala in particular, believe they could indeed make a positive contribution to peace and democracy in the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa12">I would now like to comment briefly on our views regarding the principal issues with which this Assembly will have to deal at the current session. First, I reiterate our full support for the United Nations as the supreme expression of multilateralism. We are convinced that the United Nations will have a crucial role to play in the twenty-first century. It is our view that the Millennium Declaration that our heads of State and Government issued a year ago offers the right agenda for our priorities and for the steps to be taken to attain the goals set.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa13">Second, we agree that it is necessary to adapt the Organization to the exigencies of globalization and to this post-cold-war era. It is up to us, the Member Governments, to further this process of adaptation in various areas, such as intergovernmental forums, the efficiency and efficacy of the Secretariat, the setting of priorities in shaping the programme of activities and the financial strengthening of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa14">Third, of the pending reforms, the one that has received the most attention is that concerning the Security Council. One cannot but be frustrated at the limited progress made in this area at previous sessions of the General Assembly. Now more than ever before we must redouble our efforts to endow that body with greater efficacy, broader representativity and more transparency in its working procedures. To achieve these objectives, we advocate, inter alia, an increase in the number of Council members, as well as a very sparse use of the veto power. We also believe that now more than ever before it is necessary that the Security Council's work be monitored by the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa15">Fourth, deeply shocked by the events that occurred in this country on 11 September, we reiterate our full and complete opposition to terrorism, and we will support any collective action by the international community to combat this scourge. As a matter of fact, we are already working to comply with the spirit and the letter of the undertakings embodied in Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, within the parameters of a democratic society that aspires to guarantee the human rights of its members.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa16">Fifth, we advocate the strengthening of the General Assembly, and we congratulate the President of its fifty-fifth session on his initiative to revitalize its working methods and procedures. We trust that this action will continue under the current presidency and that it will extend to the wider task of reforming the Assembly, in pursuance of the aims of the Millennium Declaration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa17">Sixth, we are convinced of the need to strengthen our collective capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts, both between States and at the national level. We believe that the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations provides an adequate basis for achieving this purpose.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa18">Seventh, as regards general disarmament, we insist on the need for progress towards the total elimination of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, and the use of anti-personnel mines and other explosive devices. In this connection, we support all concrete actions by the United Nations to accomplish these aims, including those that look to the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in all regions of the world. As regards the control of illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, we are of the view that the results of the Conference held last July to deal with this problem, while positive if allowance is made for this being the first step taken at the global level to deal with the matter, are nevertheless inadequate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa19">Eighth, we offer our full support for and active participation in the principal meetings scheduled for the years ahead, among which I wish to highlight the International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held in Monterrey, Mexico, next March, as well as the World Summit on Sustainable Development, to be held in Johannesburg.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa20">Ninth, in a world characterized by ever greater interdependence, multilateral diplomacy plays a crucial role in the fight against environmental degradation. Guatemala, as a party to the main international treaties relating to the environment, reiterates its commitment to the maintenance of ecological balance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa21">Finally, we consider that the United Nations should continue devoting itself to what we call the great unfinished business of the twentieth century -- namely, the elimination of world poverty. Together with the multilateral financial agencies, our Organization should play a crucial role in ensuring that the benefits of globalization are widely shared among all countries, not only among a few of them; this requires action at the level of each country and at the international level.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Given the globalization process the world is going through, we must recognize, as stated by the great Mexican thinker Carlos Fuentes, that unregulated globalization leads to more profound economic and social imbalance. We cannot turn economic policy into a mere balancing of accounts in which human beings and populations are not taken into consideration. How can we make demands on some countries when those demands are not made of others in similar conditions?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Civilization is being put to the test. The question is how to eliminate the universal threat posed by terrorism and at the same time maintain and renew the ethical, political, legal and social bases for ensuring coexistence in a globalized world. The only solution is to focus on fighting for more freedom, more democracy, more tolerance and more justice. In this respect, I would like to share with the Assembly the words of a distinguished Guatemalan poet, Otto René Castillo:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg003-bk02-pa03">"We have suffered in so many places the blows of the executioner and written his name so many times on so little skin, that we cannot die, for liberty has no death".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa04">May God bless and protect us.</div>

	Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa01">On behalf of the State of Kuwait, it gives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo, and his friendly country, the Republic of Korea, on his election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The office he holds undoubtedly carries enormous responsibility. My delegation offers him all the support and cooperation he needs to fulfil his mandate. I wish here to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his efficient stewardship of the last session of the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa02">Let me take this opportunity to warmly congratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan, jointly with the United Nations, on the well-deserved award of the Nobel Peace Prize, and on his unprecedented early re-election to a second term. The renewal of Mr. Annan's mandate by the international community reflects deep confidence in his character and capabilities, in addition to recognition of his past record. We look forward to continuing to see him bring into play his creative perspective in addressing a whole array of complete and interrelated issues facing our world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa03">Many of the questions and challenges facing our countries nowadays involve implications and risks that cut across national borders of sovereign countries. It is little wonder that our world has become a smaller planet where geographical boundaries, cultural diversity, economic status and ethnic multiplicity have become lesser factors in shielding communities against global influences and, by the same token, have provided larger platforms for interaction with others. The fact that the world community is now seized with fighting terrorism is perhaps yet further compelling and clear evidence of the deep interaction among and complexity of States' interests and concerns. The strong condemnation of the heinous terrorist acts committed against the United States of America on 11 September 2001 reflects the international community's recognition that the real target of that assault is the political, economic and social stability of the world order. Indeed, those attacks affected, without discrimination, virtually all nation States, all continents, all civilizations, all religions and all races.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa04">Kuwait, for its part, has had a long-standing and firm position of total and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism, irrespective of its form or manifestation. Thus, only hours after the commission of those criminal acts, which contravene and violate every religious concept and every cultural and humanitarian value system, the Government and people of Kuwait condemned them. I wish to reiterate here our deep sympathies and condolences to the bereaved families and to the friendly people of the United States of America. Let me reaffirm our full backing and support for all the efforts and measures adopted by the international coalition to destroy the dens and bases of terrorism with a view to stamping out its roots, to apprehend the perpetrators of these criminal acts and to bring them to justice. In this regard, we call for the completion of work on the development of a rigorous international legal system with which all countries of the world would comply in good faith to eradicate this evil.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa05">In compliance with Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, Kuwait has enacted specific measures to plug any loopholes that might be abused in charitable fund-raising activities and to ensure that any charity asset is used solely and exclusively for its original legitimate purposes. Our competent authorities are now in the process of taking further enforcement measures to ensure universal and strict compliance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa06">At a time when we condemn all acts of terrorism, we have been truly surprised to hear some voices that have started to mount intense and relentless campaigns linking terrorism with Islam. Those allegations represent an obvious mistreatment of and injustice to a divine faith revealed by God Almighty to humankind to ensure mercy and compassion on this planet. Islam is a faith that advocates peace, calls for tolerance, promotes amity and renounces bigotry and extremism. Suffice it to cite one verse from <i>The Holy Koran</i>:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg004-bk07-pa07">"Invite (all) to the Way Of thy Lord with wisdom And beautiful preaching" (<i>The Holy Koran, XVI:125</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa08">Therefore, we really cannot accept these tendencies in the domestic or international mass media, regardless of any excuse or pretext. Indeed, it is our common responsibility to challenge such pernicious campaigns in the interest of global social harmony.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa09">An effective fight against terrorism requires maximum international cooperation and coordination. It also demands a soul-searching review of our political, economic and social policies and practices in dealing with current global challenges. The aim is to deny evil-doers any reason to carry out their terror schemes to advance their own agendas.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa10">While we stress the importance and relevance of all United Nations resolutions and instruments relating to the suppression of terrorism, Kuwait endorses the call to convene an international conference on terrorism. A key purpose of that proposed meeting would be to set out a clear definition of terrorism that draws a line between terrorism as a phenomenon that strikes at international peace and security and the right of peoples to struggle against occupation with a view to achieving self-determination, in line with the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa11">Kuwait is in full sympathy with the friendly people of Afghanistan, who have endured a great and steady decline in their living conditions for over 20 years. The relentless conflicts and wars that have afflicted Afghanistan for too long have destroyed the infrastructure and resources of that country. In response to the appeal of the Secretary-General seeking resources to meet the severe humanitarian crisis of the Afghan people, the Government of Kuwait has announced a donation of $3 million in support of international humanitarian relief efforts. Three shipments of relief aid have also been sent to the Afghan refugees. These supplies are distributed in coordination with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Furthermore, back in Kuwait, we are organizing a public fund-raising campaign to solicit donations from individuals and private companies to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people. The total yield of that effort now stands at over $8 million.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa12">With regard to the overall situation in Afghanistan, Kuwait maintains that international efforts should be maximized to bring about the long-awaited peace and security. National reconciliation and a national coalition Government, elected by the people of Afghanistan, that represent all factions and ethnic groups are perhaps the most viable means to ensure the sustainability of the country and eventually its recovery of normal status within the region and the world. Only then will the nation of Afghanistan be able to channel its energy and resources towards reconstruction and development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa13">In the meantime, while we express our deep regret for the civilian casualties among the Afghan population, we sincerely hope that the ongoing military operations against the bastions of terrorism and the terrorists will cause no injuries to innocent, unarmed people who are totally powerless and helpless.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa14">Kuwait views the environment as a key common heritage and destiny that must be preserved for future generations. The bitter recent experience of the Gulf region, where two devastating wars took place, has left wide-scale environmental damage. Against this background, Kuwait sponsored a draft resolution submitted to the General Assembly to designate 6 November of each year as the International Day for Preventing the Exploitation of the Environment in War and Armed Conflict. Kuwait is grateful that the resolution was adopted by consensus. It is our hope that this initiative will help to further promote a deeper universal awareness of the need to safeguard our environment, which is the source of human life now and in the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa15">The eyes of the world have been fixed for over one year now on the valiant uprising of the Palestinian people, which arose as a natural and legitimate response to the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and to the backtracking of the Israeli Government from the accords it signed with the Palestinian side.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa16">The obvious policy of the Government of Israel is to reject any Palestinian, regional or international initiative. Instead, it counts as a matter of policy on the use of force; state terrorism and the creation of faits accomplis on the ground. It slams every door that is opened, designs new oppressive measures and triggers one crisis after another. Its overriding goal is to abort the peace promise born in Madrid in 1991. Israel's barbaric practices, its blatant challenge to all United Nations resolutions and its excessive and unwarranted use of lethal force in response to stone-throwing Palestinians have all combined to create an overwhelming sense of despair, frustration and gloom in the Palestinian ranks.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa17">Here one must ponder the hard lessons we have all learned from similar situations of unalloyed gloom and doom. It is precisely against this backdrop that the United Nations, the international community and the United States in particular, as a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process, must assume a special international responsibility to mount an effective and meaningful drive to force Israel to fulfil its undertakings and commitments set forth in its bilateral agreements with the Palestinian Authority, as well as to implement Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, including those relating to the city of Jerusalem, with a view to preserving its Arab and Islamic character and its holy religious identity. Kuwait therefore welcomes the indications of support by the United States for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State. We hope that this declared position will now be translated into concrete steps that will move the whole peace process forward towards its long-awaited outcome.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa18">In this context, let me stress that Kuwait will continue to support our Palestinian brothers and to provide all possible political and material assistance to them until they attain all their legitimate political rights, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on their own territory, with Jerusalem as its capital. In the same vein, Israel must unconditionally withdraw from the Syrian Arab Golan and the Lebanese Shab'a farms.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa19">The main objective of Kuwait's foreign policy is to consolidate security and stability throughout the Arabian Gulf region. This goal will remain unmet unless and until Iraq implements all relevant Security Council resolutions. It is, indeed, regrettable that the Government of Iraq persists in its allegations that it has carried out all its obligations under those resolutions. In addition, that Government continues to pursue its long-standing hostile practices and policies towards Kuwait in order to heighten regional tension and to destabilize security and peace. Kuwait has repeatedly drawn the attention of the Security Council and the Secretary-General to the non-peaceful intentions of Iraq, as exemplified by the recurrent threats made to Kuwait's security and sovereignty by many high-level Iraqi Government officials. Kuwait has also called on the Security Council to bring pressure to bear on the Iraqi Government so that it will honour all its obligations and thereby make it possible to lift the sanctions affecting the brotherly people of Iraq and to permit that country to reclaim its normal status as an active member regionally and internationally.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa20">When we discuss here the suffering of children, women and the elderly, Kuwait cannot but recall its own excruciating experience, endured over the past decade, relating to the question of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and hostages. In fact, this is a key obligation that Iraq has so far failed to fulfil. This issue remains a top national priority for the Government and people of Kuwait.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa21">The humanitarian nature of this long-running issue -- the anguish that it is causing to the immediate families of the prisoners and to our entire population -- means that resolution of the problem cannot be delayed any longer. The Government of Iraq alone bears responsibility for the lack of any meaningful progress in implementing the relevant Security Council resolutions. Those resolutions demand, inter alia, that Iraq cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the high-level Coordinator, Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov, who was appointed by the Secretary-General to facilitate the return of those prisoners and hostages. It is clear that the Government of Iraq is insensitive to the humanitarian dimension of this matter. This insensitivity is borne out by its insistence on boycotting the meetings of the ad hoc Tripartite Commission and its Technical Subcommittee since it walked away from those meetings for unjustifiable political reasons in January 1999. Let me also reiterate our call to Iraq to return our stolen property, in particular the State of Kuwait archives and other official documents.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa22">Over the past few years, the world economic scene has undergone remarkable changes. We have seen the emergence of several new economic phenomena created by the revolution in information technology and the immense scientific progress in communications and trade. These changes and phenomena have made it imperative for many countries, especially the developing nations, to introduce drastic changes to their economic plans and structures in an attempt to benefit from the globalized economy with a view to ensuring development and progress for their societies. Despite the promise of substantial benefits as a result of policies to liberalize world trade and eliminate customs barriers, we still have to make a concerted effort in order to make the globalization process a positive force that benefits all the peoples of the world. This will require the drawing up of regional and international guidelines and standards that protect the nascent economies of the developing nations from economic turbulence and crises that might otherwise have an adverse impact on the living conditions of their peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa23">In the meantime, the developed countries and the international financial institutions should double their financial aid to the developing countries in order to enable them to strengthen the underpinnings of their economic structures. In the long term, this will help to establish more balanced economic relations built on mutual benefit and common interest. With that in mind, Kuwait is pursuing a steadfast policy of support for developmental projects in many developing countries. Most recently, Kuwait has contributed $1 million to the fund established by the Secretary-General to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa24">On a parallel track, Kuwait is contributing to the funding of many developmental programmes and projects in the developing countries through international and regional financial institutions, as well as through many public Kuwaiti charitable organizations. This philanthropy is motivated by a sense of common social responsibility and social interdependence -- values that are embedded in the traditions of our Islamic faith.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa25">Let me close by saying that we look forward to participating actively in the forthcoming celebrations of the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. Hopefully, this will turn out to be another event that underscores our determination to promote and consolidate the concepts of civilized tolerance and understanding among our nations and peoples, who all yearn to live free of self-inflicted conflicts and to enjoy a prosperous life in which good and virtuous human tendencies prevail as a basis for international relations.</div>

	Mr. Malielegaoi (Samoa)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa01">Samoa is very pleased that we are meeting under the presidency of Mr. Han. On behalf of my Government, I extend warm congratulations to the President of the General Assembly and express to him our full confidence and cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa02">Allow me also a moment to pay tribute to his predecessor, President Harri Holkeri, for his outstanding service and leadership during the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, and for the significant achievements of that session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa03">We are delighted with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to our Organization. I want, in particular, to congratulate the Secretary-General and to wish him every success in his new term of office. His personal qualities and extraordinary leadership give shape to the modern face of the United Nations in ways that give force and credibility to the Organization and its performance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa04">The terrorist attacks of 11 September marked a turning point in the history of our era. These terrible events give special significance to this session of the Assembly. We need to send out from this house an unambiguous message.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa05">The clear view of my Government is that there is no room for moral equivocation. The deliberate taking of innocent civilian life, regardless of cause or grievance, is without justification in law and is morally unacceptable. My Government has declared its strong condemnation of the attacks in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, and I want today to underscore that condemnation in unequivocal terms.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa06">On behalf of my country and its citizens, I want to renew to the Government and the people of the United States our profound feelings of sorrow and sympathy and our committed solidarity and support. I also want to say that the leadership, magnificent example and courage shown by the United States demonstrate beyond doubt the extraordinary strengths of that great democracy and the indomitable spirit of its people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa07">This was a most monstrous crime, evil in premeditation and merciless in execution. Thousands of innocent lives were taken, thousands of people murdered without warning. To the families and friends of the victims -- which included citizens of many other countries represented in this Hall -- we extend our warm and heartfelt condolences.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa08">Terrorism is an offence against the core values of the United Nations. It is a direct and most serious threat to democracy, to the free exercise of human rights and to economic and social development. It has no respect for social order, human life and property.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa09">This has never been clearer than in the aftermath of these terrible attacks against the United States. Furthermore, these horrific events not only have served to highlight the need for a concerted and effective international response but have also drawn attention to the inadequacy of the traditional forms of judicial and law enforcement in combating it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa10">There cannot be any question as to the need for an effective response from the international community. Indeed, the Security Council's unanimous and momentous <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, together with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1368(2001).pdf">resolution 1368 (2001)</a>, gives the clearest signal of the international community's determination to take concrete action against the financing, training and movement of terrorists and the need for all States to cooperate in any campaign against them. We believe they provide the necessary basis for securing the broadest possible international support and cooperation for the global campaign against terrorism, in particular through the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa11">I am pleased to announce that as part of its own response in this collective effort, Samoa is taking steps to adhere to additional United Nations conventions on international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa12">We believe, however, that we need to bear in mind that fighting terrorism cannot be separated from the task of preventing organized crime and the spread of small arms and other weapons, and of containing and ending conflict. We also need to ensure that the conditions of poverty and despair, which breed ignorance, hatred, violence and extremism, are properly and effectively addressed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa13">We need, above all, to remain resolute in upholding the rule of law and the principles that underpin the rule of law. The clear affirmation of these principles and of the norms of humanitarian and international law will help deny to the perpetrators of these crimes whatever they seek to gain from violence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa14">We consider it essential to renew efforts to promote the rapid entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. A functioning international criminal court for the prosecution of terrorist acts amounting to crimes against humanity -- as we consider the attacks on the United States to be -- would provide a vital component in the international armoury against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa15">This fifty-sixth session of the Assembly is the first to follow last year's Millennium Summit. It will be the ideal occasion to take up the critical issues and strategies for implementing the Millennium Declaration. May I say in this connection that we warmly welcome and find most useful the road map report of the Secretary-General, setting out in some detail how the Summit commitments could be fulfilled.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa16">We note that most of the targets set by the Millennium Declaration are not really new. They are the determined results of global conferences of the 1990s or are derived from the body of international norms and laws that have been codified over the past 50 years. It follows that the plans of action needed for reaching the targets have, for the most part, already been developed and formally adopted by Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa17">What is needed, therefore, is not more technical or feasibility studies. Rather, as the Secretary-General's report points out, States need to demonstrate the political will to carry out commitments already made and to implement strategies already worked out. In other words, as we move from an era of commitment to an era of implementation, the international community must mobilize the will and the resources needed to fulfil the promises made.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa18">Samoa was honoured recently to host a Pacific regional meeting as part of the preparatory work for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next September. It is important to seek further progress in these preparations, especially in the completion of national assessment reports. We believe the Summit will be a unique opportunity to re-establish international commitment to sustainable development. Our own view is that there is a need to accelerate the comprehensive and targeted implementation of Agenda 21. Efforts to this end should aim to minimize and remove obstacles that impede the implementation of the Rio commitments, especially in capacity-building needs and in the provision of adequate financial and technological support.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa19">We place particular importance on the International Conference on Financing for Development. The agenda of the Conference allows for a full range of substantive issues to be addressed. It would be important to forge broad-based consensus on all these issues, and even more so on the reform of the international financial and trade architecture in a way that would be supportive of the long-term development of developing countries. There should be enhanced opportunities for the representation and participation of developing countries, including small island States, in the major decision-making institutions on global financing, monetary and trade issues.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa20">It is impossible today to visualize progress and development without access to modern information systems. The remarkable growth of information and communication technologies (ICT) is opening up boundless new possibilities for accelerated economic and social development. But the ability to translate the full potential of ICT differs from country to country. I know my country needs to develop its own capacity to do so. Yet we know that, for a developing country like my own, there is no real option but to take full advantage of the digital revolution. We will therefore be supporting every global effort to call attention to the need for bridging the digital divide.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa21">The turn of the millennium has brought new challenges, and with it changes to the character and complexity of the United Nations role in maintaining international peace and security. Samoa is proud to have been able to contribute to the civilian police operations in East Timor. From this experience it is clear to us that if the United Nations is to do its job of maintaining international peace and security, it needs to be given the necessary tools and resources.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa22">We have learned a great deal from the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, and we know that the United Nations needs to improve its capacity to respond to conflicts more effectively. And we need to move forward with the peacekeeping reform process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa23">The recognition implicit in the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations means that more than ever, we need to modernize and strengthen our Organization. We fully support the current efforts to review and revitalize the working methods of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa24">We commend most highly the work of the General Assembly's Open-ended Working Group on reform of the Security Council and its Bureau. Difficult and critical issues remain. But we need to maintain the political momentum provided in the Millennium Summit for comprehensive reform of the Security Council. Membership of the Council, both permanent and non-permanent, needs to be enlarged to reflect the realities of the present time and to enhance its role and effectiveness.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa25">Finally, let me refer to the twenty-second special session of the General Assembly, in 1999, that reviewed the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Since that time, a number of global events, such as the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries have recalled the fragility of small island States in the globalizing economy. We, of course, are grateful for this acknowledgement. However, I believe I reflect the aspiration of all small island States in saying that we need to do much more in terms of concrete actions - actions that will only be meaningful if we are assured of the committed support of the whole international community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa26">Overcoming the well-recognized vulnerability of small island States like my own, and the exposure of island communities to the effects of global climate change, natural disasters, environmental damage and global economic shocks will be an essential element of sustainable development in all small island regions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa27">May I say, in this connection, that Samoa very much welcomes the successful conclusion yesterday in Marrakech of the seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The completion of the operational details of the Kyoto Protocol will, we hope, open the way to widespread ratification by Governments and the Protocol' s early entry into force, perhaps by the time of the Johannesburg World Summit next year.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk07-pa28">The struggle against climate change is not just an environmental issue. It is also a matter of fundamental development. It is so because the adverse impact of climate change endangers economic and social progress. This is most certainly the case for small island States, which are widely acknowledged to be among the most vulnerable and the least able to adapt. The world community's response to climate change therefore requires significant, long-term changes in economic and social behaviour. The United Nations has an urgent and vital responsibility in this task as well.</div>

	Crown Prince Albert (Monaco)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa01">In taking the floor here at the Headquarters of our Organization -- recipient of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize -- meeting in New York, which has been so tragically attacked, I wish naturally, at the outset, to renew to the delegation of the United States and the great country it represents, our friend, and the American people the expression of heartfelt sympathy of the Principality of Monaco. Confronted with insane actions that prompt horror and indignation, we find ourselves in natural solidarity in this ordeal, as well as in the task that now faces the international community of making decisions and working so that our States and societies will be spared other appalling violent acts in the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa02">I would like once again to extend to you, Mr. President, and to all the members of the Bureau our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I am confident that, under your great leadership, our work will be carried out in a way that will best meet the expectations of the international community. I also wish to assure you of the spirit of cooperation of the delegation of Monaco.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa03">I also wish to hail the brilliant re-election of the Secretary-General, a clear sign of the confidence that we have in his intelligence and humanity, which are linked to his profound knowledge of the circumstances in which he must discharge his noble mission regarding world affairs, of which our Organization is seized. We also wish to assure him of the great satisfaction that the Principality of Monaco, my country, shares at the renewal of his mandate and of our full support, which we will continue to offer him.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa04">We are very gratified that the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to him jointly with our Organization, a fully deserved and justified reward that should motivate us -- the States Members of the United Nations -- to work together even more with him to champion peace and to fight the many seeds of conflict that threaten our world, terrorism, human rights violations, underdevelopment and pandemics such as AIDS.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa05">The tragic circumstances in which this session of the General Assembly is taking place make it our duty to contribute with even greater determination than in the past to the struggle against terrorism. Owing to their enormity and to the defiance that is behind them, its manifestations can, as we have seen, pose a grave threat to international peace and security. The Principality of Monaco firmly supports everything the Organization has adopted and implemented to stifle this scourge, which can be so devastating to the principles we all hold. The fact that what a lawyer would call "edged weapons" were enough to bring down one of the most modern and sophisticated symbols of human creativity reminds us of the fragility of our societies, which densely populated urban centres and interdependence in all vital areas make even more vulnerable in the light of the boundless contempt of some for human life and human dignity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa06">Among the most important of the commitments our States have undertaken on behalf of their peoples by signing the Charter of the United Nations are the obligations to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations among nations and to encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms: commitments that a handful of terrorists, in their blind facelessness, rejected with appalling arrogance and savage brutality.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa07">Two months to the day have elapsed since that tragic event. Although emotions have by no means subsided, the healing effects of time are beginning to give us a little of the sense of distance that is so necessary for more objective consideration of this astonishing political challenge and this unacceptable human tragedy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa08">The General Assembly very quickly undertook such consideration through its debate in early October on measures to eliminate international terrorism. For its part, the Security Council had already correctly marked out the initial path and the principal guidelines. And the Secretary-General has repeatedly called on Member States to remain more united than ever, and it appears that his words have been heeded.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa09">Although the nature of terrorism did not change on 11 September, its scale did. The General Assembly decided to respond with a complete cohesiveness that has been rare in its history. By adopting its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the Security Council did not shrink from drawing on the full scope and range of its powers under Chapter VII of the Charter; it took note of the existence of a threat to peace and an act of aggression and thus decided on the exceptional measures that the Principality of Monaco is proud to be implementing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa10">For us, following up on these initiatives with the necessary effectiveness means not only implementing the resolutions that reflect our common determination and our commitment to fight terrorism and formulating additional agreements and conventions, but also, first and foremost, bringing our expertise to the implementation of instruments that have already been concluded and to which we have acceded or intend to accede. Improving the Organization's action in the legal sphere is both indispensable and of top priority; we know this, as does the Government of the Principality. Therefore, yesterday I signed and deposited, on behalf of my father, the sovereign Prince, the instruments of ratification of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. The Principality of Monaco considers it essential that there be coordinated worldwide action against all forms of financing of terrorism, in order to deprive extremist movements of the resources that enable them to do such serious harm to the international community and to its deep-seated aspirations to peace and security. Afghanistan, much of whose territory is occupied and a portion of whose people are today enslaved, is the most telling example of this.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa11">The visionary Millennium Declaration and the outcomes of recent world conferences -- such as the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and the Durban World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance -- also merit special attention. Without question, these latter can contribute greatly to improving, respectively, international security and understanding among peoples. On the fight against racism, the subject of the Durban World Conference, I would note that the Government of the Principality of Monaco has decided to recognize the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, established under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to receive and process communications from individuals or groups of persons charging violations of a right set out in that instrument, to which Monaco is a party.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa12">International economic and financial cooperation, with its inevitable human and social consequences, must also be included in the reflection prompted by these events, which is more necessary than ever in the light of the issues facing us today. Because it is in part the result of the new interdependence, the globalization of trade in products, manufactured goods and services -- disparaged by some and hailed by others -- must also be a part of our urgent intellectual and practical endeavours, so that beyond the constraints and imperatives that guide it, human beings can regain their just, legitimate role. Above all, the economy must serve today's men and women, with respect for their legitimate aspirations, their vital needs and the age-old richness of their diversity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa13">Regional and subregional cooperation is particularly conducive to such a goal. My country is convinced of that; in the Mediterranean area we are engaged in the trade, culture and technological spheres, and are working to promote sustainable development and environmental protection. Nor should we neglect activities which by their nature tend to bring together men and women from different backgrounds, such as artistic and cultural events, academic meetings and sporting competitions. In the Assembly's debate on the agenda item entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal", the delegation of Monaco will recall the irreplaceable role in that connection of physical education and sport, as well as of the Olympic games.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa14">Another way to bring human communities together is the multilingualism for which the United Nations must be a model. That key item is on the Assembly's agenda this year. The Principality of Monaco will state its views on that subject and will stress the remarkable and unquestionable advantages of multilingualism for genuine understanding and mutual respect among peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa15">Alongside modern science and technology, which are moving forward and rapidly becoming universal, thus fostering exchanges among peoples, more traditional forms of communication also have an important role to play. In our view, teaching and information, more than ever before, have a fundamental role in spreading ideas of peace and understanding among men and women in our troubled times. Here, the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization has given us excellent regulatory texts, working documents and programmes that we must revitalize with increased energy in order to provide greater hope to young people, who are often frustrated by the harshness of daily life.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa16">We also, and very often, give thought to the seas and the oceans, which made such a contribution in ancient times to meetings of civilizations and to the spread of knowledge, thus enriching art and culture while developing trade and solidarity. A few days from now, the delegation of Monaco will state its views during the consideration of the agenda item on oceans and the law of the sea. My country has always been devoted to better scientific knowledge and careful protection of the marine environment, an indispensable source for the harmonious flourishing of life.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa17">Thus the Principality of Monaco, with other Member States, requests the Assembly to grant observer status to the International Hydrographic Organization, for which it is the headquarters, in order to allow that institution to strengthen its cooperation with Governments and to advance international initiatives and exchanges in marine cartography -- initiatives and exchanges designed to spread knowledge of seabeds and coastal zones, as well as to make navigation easier and safer.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa18">Respect for the decisions and resolutions taken by our forums and the strengthening of our regulatory actions, as well as the implementation of the declarations and plans of action of our recent global conferences, are significant commitments to which the authorities of the Government of the Principality of Monaco are dedicated. In our difficult times, they represent shared values which prompt us to act together in the interest of our international community, which is also in the interest of each of our countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa19">To close on an optimistic note, allow me to express the hope -- a hope that I believe is shared by many here -- that the wisdom of nations united more than ever before will be able to triumph rapidly over the evil represented by terrorism in its new global and universal form, while extirpating from the world the stubborn roots that fuel it.</div>

These security arrangements are necessitated by the presence of high-ranking participants, including more than 40 heads of State and Government, at a particularly tense period in our host city, in the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist attacks. The law enforcement authorities here have been extremely helpful and efficient in this regard, and on behalf of the General Assembly, I would like to thank them for their assistance.

	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa01">I would like to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea, on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, and to pay high tribute to him for the efficient manner in which he has been guiding this session under unprecedented circumstances. Japan is determined to continue to extend its full support to the President.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa02">I would also like on this occasion to extend my sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the United Nations on being named the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize this year. I believe it is indeed a reflection of the international community's appreciation for the efforts of the United Nations, under the leadership of Secretary-General Annan, for world peace and prosperity. The challenges facing the international community, however, are becoming increasingly diverse and difficult, and Japan will cooperate fully with the activities of the United Nations in responding to these situations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa03">I deeply mourn the deaths of the victims of the series of heinous terrorist attacks against the United States on 11 September, who have left behind loving families and friends in the United States and in many other countries. I extend my sincere condolences to the bereaved families and to all the people and the Government of the United States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa04">It is no exaggeration to say that the terrorist attacks are threats against all humankind and are challenges to democracy and freedom throughout the world. The international community must establish a world-wide circle of cooperation for the elimination of terrorism. In this context, I am encouraged that, in response to the recent attacks, the international community is taking prompt actions at the United Nations and in many other international and regional organizations and forums to prevent and eliminate terrorism. Considering the response to terrorism to be its own responsibility, Japan is determined to make the utmost efforts to prevent and eliminate such acts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa05">Japan has made it clear that the terrorist attacks on the United States must not be linked to Islamic doctrine. It is extremely important that the international community, transcending religious and ethnic differences, take unified actions to eliminate terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa06">There are many things which the United Nations has to do in order to eliminate terrorism. It is imperative that we faithfully and immediately implement Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1368(2001).pdf">1368 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">1373 (2001)</a>. Japan is actively contributing to the work of the Security Council in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is also important that all Member States accede to and fully observe the 12 international conventions relating to terrorism and accelerate the work toward the adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism and an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa07">Moreover, certain biological weapons, such as anthrax, can be produced with more limited funds and less advanced technologies than nuclear and chemical weapons. It is important to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention in order to effectively prevent the production of such weapons.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa08">Japan is itself making various efforts to eliminate terrorism. First, with regard to treaties, there are two treaties concerning terrorism which Japan has either not yet signed or not yet ratified. The International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings has recently been approved by the Diet, and Japan will immediately begin the ratification process. Japan signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism on 30 October and would like to ratify it as soon as possible.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa09">In addition, Japan is ready to cooperate with developing countries in the fields of controlling the financing of terrorism, immigration control, aviation and maritime safety, measures against terrorism through biological and chemical weapons, and so forth.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa10">Moreover, Japan will take more active measures against terrorism by enacting a new law to support the operations of other countries that are trying to eliminate the threat posed by the recent terrorist attacks and to extend assistance to affected people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa11">In view of the importance of ensuring the stability of Afghanistan's neighbours, Japan is extending emergency economic assistance, which includes assistance to Afghan refugees, Pakistan and other neighbouring countries. Japan also decided to provide up to $120 million for Afghan refugee assistance efforts undertaken by United Nations agencies and other humanitarian organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa12">With winter approaching, there is an urgent humanitarian need for the international community to deliver food and other vital goods to the people in Afghanistan. I would like to take this opportunity to call upon the international community to join forces in support of the humanitarian activities of United Nations organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa13">As we look ahead to the future, the achievement of peace and stability in Afghanistan is extremely important not only to eliminate a hotbed of global terrorism but also to lay the foundation for the long-term stability and development of the country and the neighbouring region. Based on this recognition, it is necessary for the international community to tackle this issue from a long-term and broad perspective.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa14">Towards that end, it goes without saying that, first of all, a Government must be established that has the broad support of the Afghan people, represents every ethnic group, adheres to international law and establishes friendly relations with the international community, including with neighbouring countries. However, the realities in Afghanistan do not offer a clear perspective and thus entail many unpredictable elements. Japan fully supports the activities of Secretary-General Annan and his Special Representative for Afghanistan, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, to promote political stability in Afghanistan and will actively cooperate with them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa15">Japan intends to play an active role both in the peace process and in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. We have been calling for holding a conference for peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan since 1996, and I would like on this occasion to reaffirm that Japan is ready to hold such a conference to contribute to that country's peace and reconstruction at as early a time as possible, in cooperation with relevant countries and organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk04-pa16">The United Nations has serious responsibilities for addressing relating to terrorism. Japan will spare no effort in order that this session of the General Assembly can be as fruitful as possible for this purpose.</div>

	Mr. Petersen (Norway)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa01">First, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa02">For more than half a century, the United Nations has helped to settle conflicts and restore peace. We must reinforce these efforts and focus our work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa03">For more than half a century, the United Nations has worked to promote human rights and economic and social development. We must continue to invest in human dignity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa04">For more than half a century, the United Nations has given millions of people hope for a better future. Such hope has never been more important than it is today.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa05">The Nobel Peace Prize could not have been awarded to more deserving candidates than Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the United Nations. Let me once again extend my heartfelt congratulations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa06">The terrorist attacks on 11 September were not only directed at innocent people. They were directed at the very values on which the United Nations is based.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa07">We stand united in our condemnation of these attacks, in our call for international cooperation to prevent and eradicate terrorism and to bring the guilty to justice. We will fight terrorism by all appropriate means: political, diplomatic, legal, financial and military.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa08">Norway pledges its full support to the broad global coalition against terrorism. We are part of the Atlantic Alliance. We fully support the United States in defending itself against international terrorism. We are implementing the provisions of Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by taking concrete steps to dry up the financial resources of terrorist networks.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa09">The Taliban regime has refused to adhere to mandatory Security Council decisions. It is harbouring and supporting terrorists, in blunt contravention of Council resolutions. The Taliban are refusing to cooperate with the international community in our common efforts to eradicate international terrorism. The use of military force is therefore the only option left.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa10">The military operations in Afghanistan are aimed at the terrorists and those who harbour them. They are not aimed at innocent civilians or at Afghanistan as a country. They are aimed at a group of extremists who are exploiting a world religion for their own evil purposes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa11">Afghanistan has suffered misrule and war for decades. While the immediate task is to end terrorism and provide humanitarian support to those in need, we must work in parallel for a political solution. This is primarily the responsibility of the Afghan people themselves, but the international community must assist. The United Nations must have a leading role. Planning and preparations must start now. We strongly support the efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, to help lay the foundation for a broad-based and lasting political solution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa12">We must ensure that the Afghans receive humanitarian assistance both inside Afghanistan and in neighbouring countries. But while seeking to meet immediate needs, we must also focus on the longer-term assistance that will be necessary to rebuild this war-torn society. We must improve respect for human rights and help the Afghan people, in particular women, who have suffered so terribly under Taliban rule. These are issues that Norway will focus on during its chairmanship of the Afghanistan Support Group next year. Only through coordinated efforts can we contribute to security and development in Afghanistan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa13">A year ago, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians appeared to be at hand. Today, the hope for peace and security has given way to disillusion, despair and the murder of civilians.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa14">We are convinced that the only way out of the current stalemate is through the full implementation of the recommendations in the Mitchell report, which have been endorsed by both parties and by the international community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa15">First of all, there must be an immediate end to the violence. Terrorism must be stopped. The cycle of violent action and reaction must be broken. Political leaders on both sides must do everything in their power to halt the violence and reduce the tension.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa16">Secondly, confidence-building measures must be implemented simultaneously. Trust must be rebuilt step by step, since without it there can be no real dialogue or negotiation. The Mitchell report lists several steps for restoring trust. Given the high level of hostility and mistrust, the timing and sequence of these steps are crucial. Decisions must be made now.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa17">Thirdly, the parties must find a way back to the negotiating table. A halt to the violence, the resumption of security cooperation and steps to restore trust cannot be sustained for long without serious negotiations to resolve the underlying causes of the conflict.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa18">Norway will continue to support efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict. As Chair of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, we stand ready to work with other donors to help restore the economic and social infrastructure in the Palestinian areas.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa19">The bulk of the conflicts dealt with by the Security Council are found on the African continent. As a member of the Security Council, Norway is determined to do what it can to promote long-term peace and stability in Africa. Most of the conflicts in Africa clearly demonstrate the close links between peace, good governance and development. The root causes of many of these conflicts are poverty and lack of development, but also violations of human rights and disrespect for basic democratic principles.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa20">Norway stands ready to assist in building a sound foundation for good governance and development in Africa. The developments in Burundi are encouraging, although we recognize that the peace process is still very fragile. The deployment of a multinational security force, on the initiative of South Africa, will, hopefully, improve the situation in Burundi. Norway is ready to support this initiative.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa21">The United Nations is our foremost tool for solving global problems. We should recall that combating terrorism has not removed any of the challenges that were on the global agenda prior to 11 September. Nor has it become less pressing to effectively address these challenges. We must not let the cruelty of terrorists divert attention from the ambitious goals we set for ourselves during the Millennium Summit.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa22">Meeting those objectives must remain right at the top of our agenda, along with our common fight against terrorism. If the United Nations is to be effective in pursuing these tasks, we must all commit ourselves and provide the necessary resources and financial support.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa23">As political leaders, we must show steadfast determination. We will have to make difficult choices and hard decisions, sometimes with painful consequences. But the alternative is even more pain and suffering.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa24">This is true in our common fight against international terrorism. This is true in our struggle to end poverty, eliminate infectious diseases and uphold respect for human rights and the rule of law. This is true if we are to make the United Nations our primary tool for safeguarding our common security.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I call on His Excellency Mr. Dah Ould Abdi, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mauritania.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Ould Abdi" nation="Mauritania" language="Arabic">
	Mr. Ould Abdi (Mauritania)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa01">I am delighted to be able to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are certain that your experience and wisdom will indeed guarantee success at this session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa02">I also avail myself of this opportunity to express my gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his skilful and distinguished guidance of the work of the past session. This is also an opportunity for me to extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Secretary-General and the entire United Nations staff on their tireless efforts to achieve the noble objectives of our Organization. Those efforts have quite rightly been recognized by the Nobel Academy, which decided to award the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the Secretary-General and the United Nations. This distinction reflects the most striking recognition of the efforts undertaken by our Organization to strengthen international peace and security. It also constituted recognition of the personal merits and contributions of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. Moreover, the re-election of the Secretary-General to a second term reflected the satisfaction of the international community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa03">This session is taking place in a climate of sadness in the aftermath of the criminal attacks on New York and on Washington, D.C., with their heavy toll of thousands of innocent lives. The moment they were perpetrated, Mauritania voiced its absolute condemnation of those terrorist acts. My country reaffirms its condolences to the people and the Government of the United States. These tragic events have cast light on a new situation: terrorism is no longer a marginal phenomenon but is rather a key problem that knows no boundaries and that can be combated only by means of a global strategy. Mauritania continues to be an active participant in all regional and international activities aimed at a concerted and comprehensive fight against that phenomenon. In that context, we reaffirm our unreserved support for all relevant resolutions, along with our determination, specifically, to implement Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa04">It is obvious that the role and international legitimacy of the United Nations in bringing about international peace, security and stability must be enhanced. No one must suggest that fighting terrorism is a campaign by one civilization against another, or the supposed supremacy of one civilization over any other. To the contrary, we must act together to show that the endeavour to eliminate terrorism marks a new phase in humankind's march forward, building on the heritage of all civilizations and converging in an expression of our common aspiration to a secure life and a better future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa05">In that connection, my country notes with satisfaction the sustained efforts and the success of repeated appeals to bring peace to the Middle East so that the peoples of that region can live in peace, security and prosperity. We hope that the peace process will be resumed in accordance with the principles enunciated at the Madrid Conference, in keeping with the principle of land for peace, and in conformity with Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-242(1967).pdf">242 (1967)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-338(1973).pdf">338 (1973)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">425 (1978)</a>, thus bringing about the complete withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied in 1967 and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with its capital in the holy city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa06">We express our hope for a return to stability and concord in the Gulf region, consistent with international legality and with respect for the independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait, as well as with respect for the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. In that context, we call for the lifting of the embargo that has been imposed for more than 10 years on the fraternal Iraqi people, who have suffered immensely from that embargo.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa07">With respect to Western Sahara, my country supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and of his Personal Envoy, Mr. James A. Baker III, to guarantee stability in the area through a final solution that would enjoy the support of all parties concerned.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa08">Turning to developments in the Lockerbie crisis, we welcome the success of diplomatic initiatives, but at the same time feel that the Security Council should act to lift the embargo imposed on Libya.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa09">We hail everything that has been done to resolve conflicts and wars on the African continent, which have stymied development efforts there. We welcome the recent all-Africa development initiative and the support it has won from our development partners in terms, inter alia, of sources of financing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa10">It has now been proven that phenomena such as violence and extremism are the outgrowth of poverty and frustration. The international community must therefore go further to demonstrate its solidarity and help achieve social development throughout the world. Developing countries hope for a greater, more reliable spirit of solidarity that is expressed in deeds. They need increased support from the rich countries in the form of greater investment and the opening up of international markets to products from the developing world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa11">We must recall too that debt continues to be among the major obstacles to progress in the economies of developing countries and a handicap to economic development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa12">Notwithstanding the scope of the challenges and the unfavourable international situation, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, under the enlightened leadership of His Excellency President Maaouya Ould Sid' Ahmed Taya, has made major strides towards sustainable development, with a view to improving the standard of living of our people, achieving social advancement and consolidating democracy and the rule of law in a climate of peace, security and stability. Pluralistic democracy has been restored in full with the holding some weeks ago of our fifth municipal elections and our third legislative elections. Among the latest reforms are the introduction of proportional representation, which has made possible the involvement of all parties and which has expanded the voter base and involvement in political life. Observers and opposition parties praised the conduct and the outcome of the elections. The broadest possible participation by the people is the best guarantee of success in the fight against poverty, illiteracy and exclusion. This has strengthened our conviction that true enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms depends on the ability of the people to take part in economic, social and cultural decisions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk02-pa13">A purpose of the Charter of the United Nations is to realize our common goals. Now more than ever, we must make an effort to live up to our Charter commitments in order to bring about a new world based on law and justice, guaranteeing peace, security and solidarity.</div>
	</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Gama" nation="Portugal" language="Portuguese">
	Mr. Gama (Portugal)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa01">It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I also pay tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Harri Holkeri. I renew my respects to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the notable and courageous way in which he has continued to fulfil his mandate and for the well-deserved award of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and to the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa02">My Belgian colleague has already addressed the Assembly on behalf of the 15 States members of the European Union in a statement with which my country aligns itself completely. I would, however, like to reflect upon certain issues on the international agenda.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa03">First, I cannot fail to refer to the tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September against the United States, and in particular against the city of New York and innocent citizens of many nationalities. I reiterate our deep sorrow and reaffirm our complete solidarity with all those who, like us Portuguese, were victimized by the loss of their compatriots and by the suffering of the bereaved families.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa04">We are dealing with violence without a face, violence that kills indiscriminately and that must be confronted by the international community as a whole, irrespective of the religion we practice, the race to which we belong, the ideology we follow or the civilization into which we were born. It falls to each and every State Member of the United Nations to fight this scourge, whose blind hatred has plunged the world into a state of turmoil not seen since the end of the Second World War. What is most shocking to us is the fact that we are faced with a force that ignores or despises the very concept of the right to life.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa05">We must embark on a concerted effort at all levels to submit to justice those guilty of the crimes committed, with a view to avoiding a repetition of the terrorist acts of September. We believe the United Nations has an irreplaceable role to play as the source of legitimacy for the collective effort of the international community in the fight against this common enemy. It is for other forums to complement these actions, orienting and adjusting them in accordance with the concrete needs of their respective mandates.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa06">In this context, I would like to recall that Portugal has supported without reservation the international fight against terrorism here in the United Nations, in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in the European Union, in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and in our bilateral relations with the United States and other countries. I would like to assure the Assembly that in its presidency of the OSCE next year, Portugal will attribute particular priority to this matter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa07">In the light of the current circumstances, I must stress the importance of the entire range of international legislation produced, or awaiting approval, under the aegis of the United Nations in the area of the fight against terrorism: the 12 conventions whose ratification and implementation make them crucial weapons in preventing and fighting against this scourge. Because of its particular significance at this time, I refer specifically to the work of the General Assembly on the draft global convention on terrorism. The great efforts made by the great majority of delegations in search of compromise solutions bear witness to a renewed convergence of wills in pursuit of this common goal. We should take advantage of the current momentum of collective commitment to reach the speedy completion of this essential instrument.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa08">Portugal has already signed 11 of the 12 international conventions against terrorism and is strongly committed to fully implementing their provisions. Yesterday we deposited our instrument of ratification for the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, and shortly we will deposit our instrument of ratification for the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation. We welcome the adoption of Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1368(2001).pdf">1368 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">1373 (2001)</a>, which are fundamental instruments for the cohesion of the international community in its legitimate fight against terrorism. I would also like to highlight the measures contained therein for the fight against terrorist financing -- an absolutely crucial area.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa09">As I have already stated, Portugal has supported from the beginning the international campaign under way in Afghanistan, which has been legitimized by the deliberations of the United Nations. Those responsible for the terrorist acts that claimed the lives of thousands of innocent civilians on 11 September must be captured and tried, and their military infrastructure must be eliminated. In our view, the principles guiding the intervention in Afghanistan should include the preservation of territorial integrity and the unity of the country, as well as the establishment of a broadly supported, multi-ethnic and representative Government.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa10">We believe that, from the very start, the Afghan people should be associated with the reconstruction of their country, which has been devastated in recent years by a brutal regime that is not recognized internationally. The international community should spare no efforts in alleviating the serious humanitarian situation affecting the Afghan people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa11">Finally, let me reiterate that the Portuguese Government unequivocally supports the efforts undertaken by the United Nations, and in particular by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Lakdar Brahimi, in envisioning a transitional governmental structure and in planning a possible United Nations mission on the ground. In a post-Taliban scenario, the United Nations will be called upon to take a decisive role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan as well as in the establishment of peaceful relations between Afghanistan and its neighbours.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa12">The United Nations plays an indispensable role in the prevention of conflicts, the maintenance of international peace and security and the reconstruction of territories devastated by war. Numerous conflicts are awaiting resolution and constitute a considerable challenge to the international community's capacity to guarantee their peaceful and definitive settlement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa13">The situation in the Middle East, specifically in Palestine, is the most worrisome, placing even international security at risk. The international community can spare no efforts to ensure that Israel and the Palestinians return to the path of dialogue. Only there will a solution be found that is just, both for the Palestinian people -- who have fought for decades for the recognition of their homeland, an inalienable and undeniable right, and for dignified living conditions within a sovereign and responsible Palestinian State -- and for Israel, which has an equal right to live in security in the region and at peace with its neighbours.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa14">As another example of international conflicts that drag on, apparently with no definitive resolution in sight, my country profoundly regrets the continuation of the armed conflict in Angola and its severe humanitarian consequences. Portugal reaffirms its commitment to and support for the search for a political solution to this problem, in line with the provisions of the Acordos de Paz, the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. It is essential that the commitments undertaken with regard to the international community, and principally with regard to the Angolan people, be respected. Portugal encourages the Angolan Government to redouble its efforts to achieve national reconciliation. We also encourage the introduction of political and economic reforms in Angola, with a view to reinforcing in particular the legitimacy of its representative and pluralistic institutions and the strengthening of the credibility of its monetary and financial structures.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa15">We also appeal for a return to political means on the part of those -- such as the sector that inspires the more radical line of UNITA -- that have resorted to methods, namely violence against civilians, that have placed them outside the international community. In fact, the absence of constructive proposals -- including with regard to a ceasefire or the cessation of offensive operations -- does not contribute to the implementation of possible platforms for dialogue, which the current situation demands.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa16">We praise the important and increasing contribution made by Angolan society, particularly its churches, to peace and reconciliation. We believe that a United Nations presence in Angola continues to be essential and should be encouraged.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa17">In that vein, I would like to actively encourage the Secretary-General to intensify all possible efforts to relaunch the peace process in Angola with a view to the adequate implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, so that that great country can finally guarantee tranquillity to its citizens and recover its standing and the role to which it is entitled in international life, fully taking part in achieving the objectives of the African renaissance. I am certain that the troika of observer States, as well as the African regional organizations and the European Union, will firmly support the contribution of the Secretary-General to a definitive resolution of the Angolan issue.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa18">When the international community successfully intervenes in a conflict, it should not be turned aside from the consolidation of the solutions reached. The United Nations has the responsibility of maintaining an appropriate level of involvement until the definitive conclusion of the peace process, so as not to put at risk the investments made and expectations created. The United Nations should proceed without hesitation in supporting the creation of viable nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa19">I welcome the Security Council's endorsement of this understanding with regard to East Timor, on 31 October. The international community cannot neglect the consolidation of the solutions achieved in East Timor, whose transition to independence is, in fact, a clear case of success for the United Nations and a special reason for pride for the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. I take this opportunity to underline that this entire process has been conducted in an exemplary manner by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor under the leadership of Sergio Vieira de Mello.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa20">The work of the United Nations towards the consolidation of a new and indisputably sovereign, democratic and economically viable State only reinforces the credibility of the Organization at a time in international life when its inspiration and leadership are more needed than ever before to correctly manage the great global challenges of the twenty-first century.</div>

The tragically terrible terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September are shocking to the human conscience. Those whose perverse and irrational actions took the lives of thousands of innocent people -- including many Ecuadorians -- committed a grave attack on international peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa04">From this rostrum, I wish to affirm to the people and the Government of the United States of America the profound condolences and solidarity of the people and the Government of Ecuador following this immense tragedy and to reiterate our strongest condemnation of those criminal acts, which have done violence to all peoples, as well as to universal principles and values.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa05">That is why Ecuador -- a peace-loving country convinced of the predominant role of the United Nations as the key institution for decisions affecting the world -- praises the action of the General Assembly and the Security Council in response to terrorism, particularly the Council's adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which contains the guidelines for all Member States to work urgently and in concert to prevent and suppress terrorist acts. Likewise, the international community must conclude negotiations on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism to strengthen the relevant judicial framework with concrete measures to prevent, sanction and combat this scourge. Ecuador is committed at the national, regional and international levels to the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa06">In the final years of the twentieth century, great changes took place in the world, which led to new international trends, especially in terms of the process of globalization and threats to international peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa07">The developing countries, such as my own, began adapting their national structures to deal with the demands of a decidedly competitive environment. However, it must be said that it is obvious that the adjustments and changes those countries have made to their policies and strategies are not enough in themselves to achieve complete results as long as the structural causes of the disparity between the level of development of highly industrialized economies and that of economies in need of capital and advanced technology persist. That disparity continues to widen because of financial difficulties caused by unstable short-term capital flows, persistent external debt and obstacles to truly international trade.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa08">There are signs that current international economic trends are far from providing the equilibrium and justice needed to overcome the unfavourable burdens inherited from the twentieth century. Poverty has grown at alarming rates in all regions. International organized crime has exacerbated violence and insecurity in society. Massive international migration towards developed regions continues to increase. These phenomena, along with many others, result from the lack of real, universal agreements to assist the development of human beings.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa09">The problems that the world faces today respect no national borders. They are threats demanding not unilateral action but responses based on solidarity and concerted action. That interdependence is what enabled the heads of Government and State, at the Millennium Assembly, to agree on making the United Nations, the supreme multilateral forum, a suitable and effective instrument to fight for the development of all peoples of the world; to fight against poverty, ignorance and disease; to fight against injustice, violence, terror and crime; and to fight against the deterioration and destruction of the planet. They also committed themselves to freeing all people from the scourge of war, to eradicating the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction and to strengthening respect for the rule of law in national and international affairs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa10">Ecuador, as a country that believes in and practices the peaceful settlement of international disputes, regrets and condemns conflicts between States, as well as those within States caused by civil war, ethnic conflict or other reasons. The Government of Ecuador is concerned by the uncontrolled violence occurring between the peoples of Palestine and Israel, which continues to reap a tragic harvest of death and destruction. We recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a free and independent State, as well as the State of Israel's right to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders. Ecuador reiterates its appeal to both parties to quickly return to peace negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa11">Last August, Ecuador assumed the presidency of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Its leadership is guided by its profound commitment to the cause of general and complete disarmament under effective international control, which would make it possible to foster peace and confidence among nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa12">We are witnessing the intensification of a phenomenon as old as humanity itself, undoubtedly linked to the historical development of civilization. I am referring to the enormous challenge posed by the increase in human migration, especially from the countries of the South towards the North.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa13">While migration has been positive in that it has contributed to fruitful exchange between various peoples and has deepened dialogue processes and mutual enrichment between diverse cultures, in most cases the reason for it stems from the individual's desire to seek better living conditions and broader economic prospects. We cannot think of human history without the constant and ever present phenomenon of migration, and the current era is no exception. In the present age of the globalization of markets and the possibility of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO), the liberalization of the administration of services through the free movement of persons must be emphasized.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa14">Today many developing countries of the world, afflicted by the serious consequences of economic crisis and the prevalence of structural failures that are difficult to overcome, have become net producers of migrants, men and women who feel compelled to seek broader horizons legally. Ecuador is one of those countries because of the most serious economic crisis of its recorded history, exacerbated by external factors that changed the momentum of the national development process. Internal and external factors merged in recent years, deepening this crisis, which we are overcoming in a positive way at enormous sacrifice.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa15">While migration tends to be a positive phenomenon in terms of historic objectives, the consequences for individuals are painful and stir our conscience. Because of that, my country has taken a series of actions to protect the rights of migrants and their families. With the support of the International Organization for Migration, we have held several meetings in which the State and civil society have participated. They have enabled us, on the one hand, to have direct testimony about the serious problems of this group of individuals who have left their countries voluntarily to find better opportunities and, on the other hand, to obtain concrete commitments aimed at protecting and defending human rights. I wish to underline the transnational nature of the migration problem, which requires active cooperation between countries of origin and countries receiving immigrants, as well as international bodies. In this context, I am happy to point out that Ecuador and Spain signed an agreement aimed at regulating migration, which undoubtedly has been beneficial for migrant citizens and signatory countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa16">Ecuador appeals to all Governments and sectors of civil society, but particularly to those of the developed world -- receivers of migrant workers - to redouble their efforts aimed at protecting the rights of this vulnerable sector of society in a non-discriminatory way, conscious of all the positive and fruitful aspects that the migration phenomenon brings to the general development of countries, as demonstrated by European history of recent centuries and the integration of the Americas into the West.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa17">If the twentieth century was the stage for some of the greatest humanitarian tragedies recorded by history, it is true that in that period we also witnessed the birth of a new global awareness of the urgency to protect and promote human rights and to preserve man's home, land and environment.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa18">My country has fully assumed this global challenge. We are signatories to the main instruments on this important item at both the international and the hemispheric level, and we have national tools that enable us to achieve such objectives. The National Plan on Human Rights, adopted as a State policy in June 1998 by civil society and the State, is perhaps the most innovative and visionary instrument that has been developed in our country. We hope that it will enable us to promote a real culture of tolerance and respect between the ethnic, social and cultural groups of our society. With this plan, Ecuador also complied with the mandate of the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa19">In keeping with all the above-mentioned points, Ecuador places importance on one of the mandates of the Carabobo Act, signed in July 2001 by the Presidents of the Andean Community of Nations, and has begun work on a draft Andean Charter of Human Rights, aimed at consolidating the ideas of respect for and the promotion of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual in the specific areas of culture and ethnic plurality characteristic of the Andean subregion. Ecuador was a pioneer in this important matter when, in 1980, within the subregional framework, it spurred on the adoption of the Riobamba Charter, which includes among its postulates the protection of human rights as an international obligation of all States and the condition that legitimate joint action carried out in protecting such rights must not violate the principle of non-intervention. Within this same context, Ecuador signed the Rome Statute of the International Court of Justice of July 1998, and it is taking measures for its prompt ratification.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa20">Turning to the WTO and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), there is no doubt that one of the most important items on the foreign policy agenda of States is international economic relations. Ecuador wishes to express some views on this, at the moment when the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference is taking place in Qatar.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa21">Ecuador deems it fundamental to pursue the process of opening up trade, reducing tariffs and eliminating unnecessary trade barriers. However, my country also shares the doubts of some developing countries about the advantages of launching a new round of multilateral trade negotiations when the commitments of the Uruguay Round have not yet been fully implemented, particularly those relating to the reduction and the elimination of agricultural subsidies and to agreement on special and differential treatment provisions in favour of developing countries. These are priority items of interest for Ecuador, as is the expansion of openness in agricultural trade.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa22">We emphasize the necessary reform required by the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding to strengthen the implementation regime of the decisions of the relevant ad hoc groups and the appeals body. For example, Ecuador was never able to obtain the compensation to which it was entitled, in spite of having won the banana dispute in all the proceedings before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body and an arbitration award of $201.4 million annually, the amount of the damages caused to my country by an illegal import, sales and distribution scheme of that product in Europe.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa23">Given our own experience in this dispute, we believe that compensation must be binding, if we are really speaking about free markets in the full sense of the word, and that retaliatory measures in the same sector or in cross-sectors is not sufficient to repair the damages caused, particularly to the economies of developing countries. It would also be worth evaluating other types of compensation, such as increasing technical cooperation, as a European country is proposing at this time with respect to Ecuador.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa24">Progress in trade negotiations and the fulfilment of commitments already made will make it possible for us to have an international economic and financial climate conducive to investment and to growth of the world economy, which will make a positive contribution to social and human development. These same proposals give us hope in the negotiations of the FTAA -- the Trade Negotiations Committee of which Ecuador is currently president. Our efforts take into account the various positions of countries, as well as their different levels of development and sizes of their economies, since we must seek consensus on decisions in a way that makes all the parties involved feel that their interests are guaranteed. For least developed countries, the establishment of a hemisphere-wide free-trade zone poses a challenge and at the same time offers an exceptional opportunity to be fully integrated into world economy in this new phase.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa25">I turn next to the question of external debt and development financing. The enormous limitations faced by heavily indebted developing countries such as Ecuador, resulting from disproportionately large external-debt servicing costs and from persistent obstacles to marketing our exports, work against national efforts to engender economic stability and sustainable development. Ecuador's total external debt now stands at about 64 per cent of our gross domestic product and nearly 40 per cent of our national budget; this has a negative impact on the financing of social development projects.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa26">External debt is mortgaging the economic present and future of developing countries; it has extremely adverse effects because it devours vast resources that would otherwise be used in the fight against poverty, in promoting public health and education, and in meeting many other urgent social needs. The situation thus has an increasing negative effect on market-oriented national policies and the political and democratic stability of many countries. It is therefore time for the international community to adopt effective, fair, lasting, development-oriented measures so as to make progress in easing this serious problem -- a problem that highly indebted medium-income countries too are facing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa27">Ecuador attaches the greatest importance to the International Conference on Financing for Development to be held next March at Monterrey. It will be a good opportunity to define, from the financing perspective, a new kind of world cooperation that will effectively support development, especially the development of the countries of the South.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa28">I am pleased to announce the conclusion and signature of an agreement between the World Meteorological Organization and the Government of Ecuador on the establishment at Guayaquil of an international centre for research on El Niño. I urgently appeal to the United Nations and its specialized agencies, to the international community and to international and regional financial institutions for resolute cooperation to ensure that the centre begins its work promptly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa29">Finally, as an Ecuadorian, I wish to address the question of the Colombian conflict. I wish to say that my country is following closely the internal political conflict in Colombia and the unfolding of a peace process in that country. In conformity with our policy of promoting dialogue and negotiation as the best way to overcome problems, we have frequently stated our unreserved political support for the Colombian Government's efforts to reach a negotiated peace with armed irregular groups operating in its country. Ecuador applauds the peace initiatives of President Andrés Pastrana and expresses the hope that they will be meet with a matching response from those groups. Peace in Colombia is a top priority throughout the Americas; it should also be a top priority for the international community. It is in the interest of all to help ensure that the Colombian conflict does not spread to the rest of the subregion.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa30">Ecuador has committed itself to a broad and imaginative programme of development for our areas near the Colombian border; these are aimed at substantial improvements in the living conditions of the inhabitants, with a view to eliminating the severe poverty that gives rise to the violence of drug trafficking. That programme has recently received major backing from the international community through the advisory group set up last month at Brussels. I appeal to our brethren and neighbours in Colombia to join with us in similar programmes. I urgently appeal too to developed countries to continue to cooperate with such initiatives, which in the final analysis are the best way to guarantee peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk02-pa31">The challenges facing mankind at the outset of the twenty-first century must be tackled by all countries, jointly and in solidarity. This is the beginning of a new era for major international decisions. The world Organization is the forum in which we can carry out a vast mission: equitably to solve global problems and to buttress collective security. Ecuador again commits itself to work ceaselessly to attain those noble goals.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Belkhadem" nation="Algeria" language="Arabic">
	Mr. Belkhadem (Algeria)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa01">This session is taking place at a time when there is a new international awareness of the global nature of problems of peace, security and development. The barbaric terrorist attacks against the United States on 11 September, and their alarming consequences, made it clear that terrorism is now a factor for worldwide political and economic destabilization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa02">Algeria has conveyed its deepest sympathy to the families of the victims of those horrible acts. It did so with all the more sincerity and feeling because for more than a decade Algeria itself has been enduring the horrors of terrorism. The international reaction to this devastating scourge has been a heartening collective wake-up call. Mobilization and multifaceted action to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is now worldwide. In that regard, Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> unquestionably constituted a major breakthrough. It was adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter and obliges all States unequivocally and dutifully to outlaw terrorist activities and their supporters and sponsors, wherever they may be. Algeria is fully cooperating with the international community in the implementation of that universal collective endeavour. Algeria stresses how important it is that the resolution be strictly implemented and reaffirms the imperative need for universal adherence to existing international anti-terrorism instruments and for the ratification of relevant regional instruments. Algeria believes, inter alia, that the adoption of a comprehensive convention to combat terrorism is essential. For its part, my country is ready to cooperate with other nations to achieve this as quickly as possible.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa03">The dangers that terrorism poses to global peace and security highlight the need for a ruthless struggle against it, in particular through dismantling bases and networks, draining sources of financing, cooperating in exchanging information and providing proper equipment to countries that are victims of terrorism, and reviewing permissive national legislation regarding the right of asylum as well as the justification for murder or planning criminal activities to be committed in third countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa04">While the urgency of this struggle has made it possible to achieve notable progress in a few weeks, we must be unanimous in our determination if we are to confront the roots of terrorism -- that is, we must address the problems that constitute a breeding ground for extremism and intolerance throughout the world. This means that Islam, a religion of peace and tolerance, cannot in any way be associated with terrorism, which is alien to its values. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that the anti-terrorist struggle is not aimed at any one country, religion, culture or civilization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa05">The United Nations, which has often diagnosed and analysed the state of our world, has rightly emphasized that problems tend to be of an economic, political and social nature and that their causes are both national and international. The denial of the right of peoples to self-determination, the exacerbated phenomena of exclusion and poverty, the persistence of economic imbalances, the intensification of social inequalities, the continued deterioration of the environment and the pursuit of the arms race are all problems awaiting solutions and concrete measures that, in many cases, United Nations forums have already defined and adopted in many cases adopted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa06">The commitments undertaken recently to make globalization a factor of integration rather than of exclusion -- in particular the objectives enshrined in the Millennium Declaration -- take on full importance here, since they highlight the urgent need for effective measures to build a stable and united world on a solid foundation. Today, reality amply demonstrates that globalization, despite its enormous potential and opportunities, has not yet yielded the expected results with regard to the universal improvement of living conditions. The processes to which it leads have too often widened the existing cracks within societies and exacerbated differences among nations. This has encouraged marginal groups to exploit the difficult social situations to which many peoples are subject and to promote isolationism and rejection of the other.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa07">The Declaration and Plan of Action adopted by the Durban World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance provide a framework for inspiration and action to build more harmonious and fraternal relations among people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa08">First of all, there is a need at the United Nations level to set aright unacceptable situations of injustice and denial of rights. In Palestine, the serious situation that prevails as a result of the continued Israeli occupation and its oppressive practices requires the attention of the entire international community. It demands urgent action to put an end to the daily trials of the Palestinian people, who are subjected to a deliberate policy by the Israeli army of intimidation, abuse and murder. This policy is likely to endanger the resumption of the peace process, taking the entire region to the brink of a conflagration with incalculable consequences.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa09">Given the situation, Algeria reaffirms its total solidarity with the Palestinian people and their inalienable right to an independent State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital. Algeria urgently calls upon the international community to ensure the protection of the Palestinian people by sending international observers to the region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa10">Algeria wishes to emphasize that only a solution based on international legality -- in particular Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-242(1967).pdf">242 (1967)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-338(1973).pdf">338 (1973)</a> -- as well as on the principle of land for peace, adopted at the Madrid Conference, can ensure just and lasting peace and security for all the peoples of the region, as Chairman Yasser Arafat indicated in his speech this morning. Algeria would also like to reaffirm its solidarity with the brotherly peoples of Syria and Lebanon for the restoration of their lands still under Israeli occupation. In addition, Algeria welcomes the decision of the Security Council to lift the sanctions on the brotherly people of Sudan and seizes the opportunity to renew its appeal for the lifting of the sanctions on the brotherly Iraqi and Libyan peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa11">The situation in the Western Sahara, where the settlement process has been halted for more than a year and a half, is also a source of great concern and a factor of instability in the Maghreb and in Africa as a whole. The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has not been able to continue the implementation of the settlement plan of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), though it had been accepted by the two parties to the conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberación de Saguia el-Hamra y del Río de Oro (POLISARIO), in particular because of the many challenges that followed the identification stage.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa12">Action by the United Nations in the Western Sahara, carried out through MINURSO since 1991, should be commended, and the progress made within the framework of the implementation of the settlement plan -- in particular the identification of the electoral body -- should be maintained and consolidated. Here, the two parties should be reminded of their obligation to cooperate openly and sincerely with MINURSO, to conclude the referendum process and to call upon the bodies of the United Nations that deal with this issue to strictly respect their mandate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa13">The unswerving position of Algeria on the issue of the Western Sahara stems from its dedication to international legality and to respect for the right of people to self-determination. Algeria therefore supports the holding of a free and transparent referendum, organized by the United Nations that will allow this people to decide on its destiny. Any effort or initiative to settle that dispute must be part of the framework of international legality and, in particular, of the resolutions on decolonization adopted by the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa14">Elsewhere on the African continent, the determination of African peoples and leaders and the support of the international community are starting to bear fruit in the areas of conflict prevention and settlement. The Peace Agreement concluded in Algiers in June 2000 between Ethiopia and Eritrea put an end to a devastating two-year war between those two brotherly African countries and opened the way to a peaceful settlement of their dispute. The progress made since the full deployment of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea attests to the commitment of those two countries to strengthening the basis for a lasting peace and for mutually beneficial cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa15">Similarly, the implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which has long been plagued by numerous difficulties, is now well under way. The international community must pursue its efforts to make the settlement process irreversible and to facilitate the inter-Congolese dialogue.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa16">Africa also welcomes the progress made in Sierra Leone in the implementation of its disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, which have been made possible by the courageous and determined action of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa17">Despite the positive developments that have occurred in Angola there, UNITA continues to sow death and destruction among the people of that country. A return to security will require strict respect by all States for the punitive measures laid down by the Security Council against UNITA.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa18">Finally, regarding recent events in Burundi, my country welcomes the decision of the parties to the conflict there to establish a transitional Government that guarantees the participation of all the inhabitants of that country in the management of their own affairs. We hail the important role played by Mr. Nelson Mandela in achieving understanding among the parties in Burundi in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa19">The end of the cold war eased the climate of suspicion and distrust that permeated international relations and was replaced by a measure of optimism based on new prospects. We hope that this optimism will signal an end to outdated doctrines and theories of nuclear deterrence and the balance of terror and that it will open the way to a bold approach to guaranteeing the security of all States. Given this qualitative transformation in international relations, our hope of seeing our planet forever free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is indeed strengthened.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa20">The need to establish renewable international cooperation based on mutual interests and shared duties and responsibilities is more urgent than ever before. This new spirit must become an incentive for launching comprehensive initiatives to seek a genuine understanding of the problems plaguing the entire world. In brief, we must prepare for international governance that truly reflects the requirements of rationality, transparency, justice, democratic participation and responsibility, without which any discussion of a new world order is meaningless and of no use to humanity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa21">The progress that has been achieved at the political and economic levels in several regions and countries must be consolidated and enhanced through the international promotion of good governance. In this respect, the direct and indirect threats to sustainable development that jeopardize the survival of our planet require us all to mobilize on a vast scale in the context of the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Urgent measures must be taken to halt the devastating effects of various means and types of production and consumption that have become untenable. These must be transformed in a qualitative way, taking into account the needs of mankind as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa22">In the same vein, the ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization that opened in Doha two days ago and the International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held in a few months in Mexico, are promising prospects for the lasting resumption of growth in the developing countries and for improving the living standards of their peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa23">Four months ago, African countries, meeting at the 37th Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity in Lusaka, clearly expressed Africa's official response to the new needs and aspirations of its peoples through their solemn launching of the transitional process towards the African Union and their adoption of the New African Initiative. These steps form an integral part of the reform process undertaken over the past few years by the African countries at the national, regional and continental levels to bring Africa into step with an ever-changing world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa24">Aware of the magnitude of the challenges facing the continent and of the need to acquire a global integrated programme for the social and economic recovery of the continent, African leaders at the Lusaka summit adopted a plan that was conceived by and for Africa. Algeria, which actively participated in the creation and drafting of the New Partnership for African Development, believes that this programme will open the way to practical solutions to the economic and social problems of Africa. Thus, in order for our Organization to bolster its credibility and effectiveness, to address the great changes on the international scene and to be more responsive to the aspirations of this global village, it must earnestly pursue its transformation and be more open to the world and to itself.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk01-pa25">It is also necessary to ensure greater democracy and fairness within the United Nations system, in particular in the maintenance of international peace and security. The Security Council incontestably requires a drastic reform of its processes and membership. In a word, the United Nations must serve the great family of mankind as a whole.</div>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Hor Namhong" nation="Cambodia" language="">
	Mr. Hor Namhong (Cambodia)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa01">I wish to join other representatives in congratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your able guidance the work of this General Assembly session will be another milestone on the new international scene, particularly in confronting the new challenges facing our world, especially after the extremely tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa02">I believe that the world has completely changed since the attacks against the United States of America, the deadliest terrorist attacks ever committed, in which so many innocent lives were lost. These acts of terrorism shook the world as the images of destruction were broadcast live. They were undoubtedly crimes against humanity. We must strongly condemn these terrorist acts. We cannot forget those who lost their lives and the families of the victims. In this regard, I wish to extend, on behalf of the people and the Royal Government of Cambodia, our most sincere condolences to the families of the innocent victims and the Government of the United States of America.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa03">Cambodia fully supports the United Nations resolutions condemning the acts of terrorism against the United States. Cambodia also fully endorses the international efforts in combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Cambodia is disturbed, however, over the loss of innocent civilian lives as a result of the bombings in Afghanistan. We must do everything possible to avoid civilian casualties and loss of life.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa04">In order to find solutions to the current problems facing our world, I believe that we need to look into not only the root causes of terrorism but also the other contributing factors that are confronting the world today. First, we need to look for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, in particular a solution to the Palestine problem. We need to respect the fundamental right of self-determination of the Palestinian people. In this regard, Cambodia supports the creation of a Palestinian State as early as possible. One may argue that the present situation in the world may have opened a window of opportunity for finding solutions to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. I believe that all parties concerned should, and I hope that they will, give peace in the region a chance, which is the way to overcome the lingering conflict in the region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa05">Secondly, the increase in poverty in the world is another crucial problem that must be addressed with some sense of urgency and collective responsibility. Poverty is unquestionably one of the major causes of the problems in the world today. I think that all nations must join hands to fight poverty throughout the world. At the same time, we must work to reduce the widening gap between the developed and developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa06">In this regard, it is important for us to recall last year's Millennium Declaration, whose main thrust was a war on poverty in the most comprehensive and most inclusive manner possible. For the developing countries, one of the main challenges in the war on poverty is managing the negative side of an irreversible process of globalization. The key question is how to best integrate ourselves into an ever-accelerating process of globalization so that the developing countries will not be left out or continue to be further marginalized. The process of globalization is a reality without precedent, and no country in this world is immune to, or able to opt out of, the process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa07">At the same time, we should work collectively towards minimizing the negative impact of globalization, which would enable the developing countries to pursue sustainable development and poverty reduction and provide the necessary tools for the people to improve their standards of living. Moreover, we think that if there is no mechanism or principle which is universally accepted in order to manage globalization, the gap between the developed and developing countries will further widen in the future. This is a problem of human security, which the international community must consider finding appropriate ways and means of addressing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa08">Thirdly, another side effect of poverty is the growing epidemic of HIV/AIDS worldwide, across regions and continents, affecting mostly the poor and the developing countries. Therefore, we believe that the rich, developed countries should do more to help in the fight against the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa09">Fourthly, as a contributing factor for combating terrorism, we should attempt to find practical solutions to the growing threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the illegal trade of small arms and light weapons around the globe. In this context, Cambodia fully agrees with the Secretary-General's statement at the Millennium Summit that the issues of nuclear weapons and illicit trade in small arms and light weapons should be given the highest priority on the United Nations agenda in the area of arms control and disarmament. In this context, Cambodia wishes to call upon all countries to respect all the nuclear-weapons-related treaties, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. Cambodia strongly believes that the international community should work towards a gradual reduction of nuclear stockpiles to a minimal level, and non-proliferation and non-production of such weapons in the future, which should be the basis for building and maintaining a peaceful, safe and nuclear-free world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa10">(<i>spoke in French</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa11">As a country that has suffered considerably from the proliferation of small arms, Cambodia welcomes the adoption of the Programme of Action at the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. In this regard, I congratulate the United Nations on taking bold steps in addressing this vitally important issue. Since 1998, the Royal Government of Cambodia has carried out a nationwide campaign to address the problems regarding such arms. So far more that 120,000 small arms and light weapons have been confiscated, and more than 50 percent of them have been destroyed in the framework of an operation named "Flames for Peace."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg026-bk02-pa12">Fifthly, for the United Nations to play a greater role in addressing the increasing number of complex problems that are now arising, the Kingdom of Cambodia is of the view that the General Assembly and the Security Council must be reformed so that they become more effective and more efficient. As we may recall, one of the most important pledges contained in last year's Millennium Declaration was the revitalization of the General Assembly. While progress in the structural and procedural aspects of the General Assembly are vitally important, we must not lose sight of the primary objective of this exercise, which is to return to the General Assembly its original function as the chief deliberative and representative body of the United Nations. In other words, the international community, especially the United Nations as a whole, must play a constructive and proactive role, without exclusivity, including in the struggle against terrorism.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg028-bk02-pa01">I also believe that the current global situation justifies a call for a constructive and timely reform of the Security Council, which must reflect the realities and needs of the world today. The Security Council must be reformed to be made more representative, more democratic and more effective in its decision-making processes. Its membership and structure, passed down since 1945, are inarguably outdated and no longer reflect the political, economic, social and demographic realities of our time or, apparently, the growing issues of human security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg028-bk02-pa02">As the United Nations Charter mandates the Security Council's responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security, it is important for us to ensure that the interests of all nations are sufficiently reflected in the Council's composition and voting procedures. It is unacceptable, however, that the two thirds of the world's population residing in the developing countries are not equitably represented in the Council. Such practices could jeopardize the Council's credibility in the maintenance of international peace and security. In this regard, Cambodia supports the decision of the non-aligned countries in favour of an additional increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent members and in particular reiterates its strong support for Japan, Germany and India as candidates for permanent membership of the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg028-bk02-pa03">In conclusion, it is clear that we are living in a fast-changing world in which the rapid pace of globalization and growing interdependence are the order of the day. Peace, stability and prosperity are interrelated and affect all nations and peoples on this planet, especially following the extremely tragic terrorist attacks in September. It is therefore essential that we work together to build a genuine community of nations in which the gap between the developed and the developing countries is reduced; in which the threat of terrorism and nuclear annihilation are eliminated; in which the danger of a global HIV/AIDS epidemic is mitigated; and in which poverty is alleviated. This can come about only through the development of a more genuine cooperation, the fostering of enhanced mutual respect, the cultivation of greater tolerance, the promotion of better understanding and the emergence of a broader spirit of true union among nations in a world that works on behalf of all.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg028-bk02-pa04">I strongly believe that we can achieve all this through collective will and actions that will help us to usher in a new and brighter future for our world -- a world free of terrorism, a world of stability, peace, security, development and prosperity for all peoples in the twenty-first century.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg028-bk02-pa05">(<i>spoke in English</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg028-bk02-pa06">Finally, I am pleased to express, on behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia, our very warm congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to a second term in the noble post of Secretary-General. I do believe that, with his dedication and long-standing experience in dealing with the many challenges faced by the United Nations, the Secretary-General will certainly achieve more success for the sake of peace and stability for all nations Members of the United Nations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa01">It is with strong feelings that we return today to New York to find it still darkened by mourning yet ever brightened by the aura of freedom. New York is the capital of international diplomacy, a crossroads of cultures and civilizations, a cosmopolitan city in which nations co-exist. New York is a city whose heart will forever hold the memory of the victims of the human folly of 11 September 2001.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa02">To the people and Government of the United States, under the enlightened leadership of President George Bush, we reiterate our deepest condolences. We also thank them warmly for their welcome and for the facilities placed at our disposal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa03">On behalf of the delegation of Madagascar, from this United Nations rostrum I convey to Mr. Han Seung-soo our sincerest congratulations on his election to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. To his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, we pay well-deserved tribute for the success of the Millennium Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa04">To Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of our Organization, we express our pride at the important distinction he has recently been awarded. The Nobel Peace Prize that he has received is both a recognition of his unassailable competence and dedication as well as a reflection of the value of the United Nations and the trust placed in it by the entire world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa05">Our Organization is being confronted with new concerns every day. It is called on to keep up with the pace of international change in order to better fulfil its mission as a regulator of inter-State relations, a facilitator of negotiations and a catalyst of development. The United Nations remains the supreme decision-making body and the main guarantor of world peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa06">Madagascar supports profound reform and a streamlining of the Organization's institutional structure in order to improve its performance. Madagascar remains convinced and confident, however, that our Organization is still a privileged platform for the exchange and harmonization of views.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa07">Creating together a climate of world peace and harmony; struggling in unity against poverty, the AIDS pandemic, transnational crime and environmental degradation; building in concert a better future for the coming generation, our children, who are tomorrow's decision-makers -- these were the expectations voiced at the Millennium Summit in this very Hall. It was an ambitious millennium, given the prospects and programmes of action projected up to the year 2015, and one of multiple challenges, given that objectives remain to be achieved and that we have a long road ahead of us. Above all, it was a millennium for taking stock and moving forward, since the situation of human and economic development calls on us to rise to its expectations and to overcome its hurdles.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa08">A world of well-being is what our children need today and tomorrow above all. The devotion of my country and my people to all questions relating to children is seen in our genuine commitment to international conventions. On 16 July 2001, Madagascar ratified International Labour Organization Convention No. 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The Hague Convention on the Intercountry Adoption of Children is currently being considered by our Parliament. The implementation of the law of 1999 on paedophilia complements the Optional Protocol that we signed in September 2000 regarding the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa09">We welcome enthusiastically the decision to hold in May 2002 the Summit on the future of children. In view of our intention to participate in that event, a national parliament of children has just been established this year.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa10">The family must remain the basic core of society, the foundation of the nation, a source of human dignity and the guarantor of stable social development. Consequently, the family must be protected, as must be the values associated with it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa11">Madagascar, an island in the Indian Ocean, thus far little affected by the AIDS pandemic, is nonetheless not indifferent to this scourge. A strategy and a programme to prevent and combat AIDS, within an established institutional framework, are being pursued by all State and non-State institutions in the country. Having participated actively in the United Nations special session on AIDS in June 2001, Madagascar fully supports the resolutions adopted at that meeting. Since Africa has a wealth of medicinal plants, any research in this connection will benefit from consistent support.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa12">Africa pledges resolutely, and with the full awareness of its responsibilities, to take its own destiny in hand. Positive development indicators are imminent, and are appreciated. Continental integration is underway within an effective African Union. Regional mechanisms for African conflict management and prevention are already operational. The New African Initiative, including long-term development programmes for our continent, has benefited from the support of the international community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa13">Nonetheless, in the context of globalization, the economic and commercial rules of the game are not always in the developing countries' favour. We deplore the widening gap between the economies of the countries of the South and those of the countries of the North. The World Trade Organization, which is meeting right now in Qatar, should further encourage the advanced countries to give greater trade preferences to the developing countries. Given the negative impact of a possible complete liberalization of trade, the economy of the least developed countries must be taken into consideration by the international community, because any new multilateral contract engenders binding obligations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa14">Integration within regional markets will clearly make it possible for our countries to adapt steadily to the demands and constraints of the world market, while promoting intra-regional and South-South exchanges. We expect of regional cooperation a concrete transfer of technology and know-how and a harmonization of standards.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa15">Madagascar's economy has followed the dynamics of growth thanks to steadfast national efforts and an enterprising partnership. Madagascar joined the free trade zone of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), on 31 October 2001. We have benefited from the Initiative of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and from the rescheduling or cancellation of our debts by a number of our creditors. We are signatories of the Cotonou Agreement of July 2001, and are beneficiaries of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). All of this bears witness to the confidence that the international community has in our country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa16">However, out of solidarity with all low-income countries, we believe that there is an urgent need to review international policy regarding official development assistance. We welcome the holding in Brussels last May of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. The time has come for concrete action, so that the objective of reducing poverty by half by the 2015 can become a reality.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa17">Madagascar has always been attentive to and concerned by situations of international conflict, and more particularly those that affect the African continent and the Indian Ocean area. In the framework of the Organization of African Unity and of the International Organization of la Francophonie, we have supported the Camoros in their process of national reconciliation and their return to constitutional normalcy. We welcome the draft constitution prepared by the Tripartite Commission, which included different trends and factions of the three reunited islands, and the decision to hold the referendum next December.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa18">It goes without saying that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict claims our full attention. We believe it is imperative that a special session be convened on this question by the United Nations and also that an international force be deployed to protect the innocent victims. We support the Palestinian people in its struggle for independence and sovereignty. We also welcome the continuation of peace negotiations between the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The principle of land for peace must be respected. This must be done in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa19">Afghanistan, a den of extreme poverty and hotbed of tension, has recently become a site of war. While the fight against terrorism is legitimate and is the responsibility of all States Member of our Organization, support for refugees and the civilian victims of war is a duty that shouts out at all of us. Humanitarian intervention is therefore imperative.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa20">Madagascar reiterates its commitment to disarmament efforts, an essential element of the United Nations strategy for peace and security, according to the Secretary-General's most recent report (<a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-1">A/56/1</a>). My delegation welcomes the holding in July 2001 of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Of course, we support the first global Programme of Action that was adopted. My country reaffirms the urgent need to implement the conventions of the United Nations that condemn the production, proliferation and illicit sale of weapons. Madagascar is a party to several multilateral treaties regarding disarmament. The Treaty of Pelindaba, which makes Africa a nuclear-weapons-free zone, has just been ratified by our Parliament.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa21">Our reunion here in this Hall, in this large United Nations family, reminds us that we are survivors, and that it is only a matter of time before the terrorist sword of Damocles dangerously suspended over our heads, may again perpetrate its odious carnage. The fact that we have been spared compels us to mobilize and to coordinate a united and merciless struggle against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa22">Madagascar, my country and its people, coming from a mixture of many cultural, religious and ethnic backgrounds, reiterates its condemnation of the terrorist barbarity that struck a sister nation, with victims of all nationalities having perished in the attacks of 11 September 2001.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa23">Terrorism is the very negation of everything that we, as leaders of our different nations and institutions gathered here, do to make of this world a universe of law, humanity and lasting peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa24">Madagascar has already begun the process of ratifying the 12 conventions against terrorism, and last October signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Likewise, we will immediately proceed to sign the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms. We support the draft comprehensive convention against terrorism, submitted by India, which is based on existing conventions, with the emphasis placed on concrete measures that member countries would be able to apply.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa25">International cooperation in police and judicial investigations must be consolidated, taking into account exchanges of information on major trafficking activity. This would require harmonization of legislation and the establishment of multilateral operational structures for the prevention and suppression of transnational crimes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa26">The threat of bioterrorism has in recent times created a psychosis of collective fear that has spread throughout the world. This means that the international community must design and urgently put in place effective protective measures against this danger. The Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is now before the Parliament of Madagascar for ratification. It is now imperative that we think deeply and on an ongoing basis about the subject of terrorism. Combating terrorism also means identifying and understanding the causes of this scourge and eradicating the evil at its very roots. In order to halt its ramifications we must remove all sources of support, which involves destroying the many laboratories and bases for logistical backup and cutting off financing, weapons acquisition, fund-raising and proselytizing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa27">On the basis of that conviction, we are pleased that our Organization has adopted the Programme of Action for dialogue among civilizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa28">In accordance with the United Nations resolution making 2001 the International Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, last October Madagascar organized a workshop in which all those involved in our country's development participated. From the discussions emerged the notion that traditional cultures could serve as a point of reference for modern nations to design a code of peaceful behaviour. The prevention of terrorist acts could also be complemented by educational and training programmes and information programmes on the culture of peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa29">We have proposed the establishment at the national level of a non-aggression pact among the country's religious institutions in order to head off any dangers of religious war or other conflicts. This initiative deserves to be expanded to a wider scale in order to ensure a climate of confidence and calm. We must have the courage to denounce the excesses of fanaticism and religious extremism, which endanger our common values.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg029-bk02-pa30">The time has now come for dialogue. It is not too late to become aware of the value of dialogue. Having a dialogue does not mean tolerating misdeeds, nor does it mean any complicity with criminals, who must be punished. Above all, having a dialogue means going beyond terrorism through a new understanding of the concept of enemy. It is now time to hear each other, with mutual respect and in a climate of understanding that takes the other into account. It is now time for shared responsibilities and continued harmonization of views for the establishment of a world of trust.</div>

	Mr. Sangaré (Côte d'Ivoire)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa01">The opening of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly has coincided with tragic events for the host country and for the entire world. On behalf of the Government and the people of Côte d'Ivoire, allow me to take this opportunity to once again express our sincere condolences and sympathy to the Government and the people of the United States and to all the other countries directly affected by this tragedy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa02">The delegation of Côte d'Ivoire is pleased to extend its warm congratulations to the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. We would also like to extend our congratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, who so ably guided the work of the Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa03">Our Organization and its Secretary-General have just been honoured with the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize. The Government and the people of Côte d'Ivoire hail this well-deserved international recognition of the importance and quality of the work done by the Organization under the leadership of the Secretary-General.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa04">My delegation extends to Mr. Kofi Annan its warm and fraternal congratulations on his historic re-election and on the greatly appreciated work he is doing as the head of the United Nations. The recognition he has just received is an illustration of the universal appreciation of his great qualities as a diplomat and statesman, which he has put at the service of peace and development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa05">In organizing the Millennium Summit and in his personal involvement in the holding of the special session on HIV/AIDS, as well as his involvement in the special session on children, the Secretary-General has put back on the agenda the concerns of developing countries in general, including those of Côte d'Ivoire. It is absolutely vital to sensitize the international community on matters related to the fight against poverty and improving protection of the rights of women and children, to mention just two areas. Côte d'Ivoire would like to express its appreciation in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa06">Finally, the Government and the people of Côte d'Ivoire would like to express their gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his great understanding of, and support for, Côte d'Ivoire throughout the very difficult times it has experienced since the end of 1999. He demonstrated this once again by sending a personal representative to the forum on national reconciliation that is now under way. The Government and the people of Côte d'Ivoire and the international community have great hopes for that forum, whose success will help all participants to dispel misunderstandings and help Côte d'Ivoire to resume its economic growth in order to be able to play its proper role.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa07">My Government attaches great importance to a social policy aimed at combating poverty and meeting the needs of all sectors of our population in the areas of health, education, employment and nutrition. As part of that policy, a strategy document on poverty reduction is being prepared.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa08">Beginning in June 2002, a health insurance plan will be in place as part of a national social security system. Through that plan everyone living in Côte d'Ivoire will be able to have health insurance, regardless of social status. The National Assembly adopted the necessary laws to that end on 9 October.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa09">No effort will spared to ensure that we eliminate the most serious social shortcomings as soon as possible. In that regard, our greatest ambition is for development and growth to reach the most remote regions and for the necessary basic services of running water, electricity, schools and health-care centres to be available to all the people in every village of Côte d'Ivoire. It is with this goal in mind that the Government has established a decentralization programme, thanks to which 58 departments of Côte d'Ivoire will be able to administer themselves and oversee their own development on the basis of a budgetary packet granted to them annually through legislative appropriations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa10">In order to attain these various objectives, the macroeconomic framework will have to be improved through rigorous legal and budgetary measures and through good governance. Côte d'Ivoire is strongly determined to do its very best in this area.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa11">Ensuring the well-being of children and the protection of their rights is a priority for my country. The special session on children will take place in a few months, and our Government places great hope in the fact that it will give us an opportunity to clarify the actions we are taking in favour of children, particularly in the fight against cross-border trafficking in children.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa12">Last June, in this very Hall, States adopted new measures and initiatives in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Côte d'Ivoire endorses all of these recommendations and will do everything possible within the framework of a renewal policy to reach as quickly as possible this objective, which is intended to ensure equal opportunity among men and women.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa13">The problem of HIV/AIDS has become one of the major concerns of the world today in general and for Africa in particular. UN/AIDS statistics and those of many other institutions state that throughout the world over 30 million people are infected, of which 1.2 million are children. Africa represents only 10 per cent of the planet's population; nevertheless, since the beginning of this epidemic, 83 per cent of all deaths due to AIDS have fallen to Africa. As the Secretary-General has rightly stressed in his report of 16 February 2001, if the epidemic continues to grow at the present rate, the most affected nations will see a decrease of at least 25 per cent of their estimated economic growth over the next 20 years. For this reason we are very glad to see the setting up of a Global AIDS and Health Fund at the United Nations Secretary-General's initiative. It would also be a good time to set up mechanisms promoting the exchange of experience among those countries which have managed to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS and those which are still seeking solutions to it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa14">No country can flourish if international peace and security are threatened, which is why Côte d'Ivoire is extremely concerned by an arms race which dares not speak its name. As party to the Pelindaba Treaty, Côte d'Ivoire welcomes the increasing number of treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in different regions of the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa15">The illicit proliferation and circulation of small arms is another phenomenon that affects the African continent, and West Africa in particular. This phenomenon constitutes a permanent threat to peace and slows down development in this region, where over 15 million light weapons are circulating illegally. Since the end of the Second World War, the international community's attention has focused on nuclear arms. However, it is conventional small arms that continue to create millions of victims. Here we share the Secretary-General's opinion expressed in his Millennium Report: light weapons are indeed weapons of mass destruction. They exacerbate regional conflicts and contribute largely to the use of child soldiers. They kill women, youth and children. The insecurity that this creates prohibits any possibility of smooth economic development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa16">As Members of the General Assembly know, on 31 October 1998 in Abuja, Nigeria, the Heads of State of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) decreed a moratorium aimed at reducing the proliferation and circulation of light weapons in West Africa. During the recent African summit, which took place in Lusaka in July 2001, this moratorium was extended for a three-year period, starting on 5 July 2001. This struggle can be efficient only if it is led by the international community as a whole, and it has to involve, of course, weapons manufacturers, official users and civil society. The United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, which was held in New York from 9 to 20 July 2001, is in our opinion headed in the right direction. Côte d'Ivoire is greatly interested in the implementation of the Programme of Action adopted by the Conference.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa17">Eight years ago the General Assembly decided to undertake the reform of the Security Council. As it stands at the moment, the Council cannot be seen as a democratic and representative body of all United Nations Member States. The Council's functions have to be reinforced so that it can continue acting efficiently as the United Nations body with the primary role of ensuring the maintenance of international peace and security. In order to do this, it is urgent and right that the number of permanent and non-permanent members be increased so that the composition of the Council is in line with the complexity of a world that has seen great development, both quantitative and qualitative, in international relations, the key aspect being the increased complexity of the problems to be solved.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa18">In our view, the expansion of the Council should aim at re-adapting the whole mechanism of taking and implementing decisions. This is why the exercise of the right of veto, equitable representation and expansion of membership are all problems that have to be solved as soon as possible, bearing in mind the vital urgency of reforming the Security Council so that all nations and regions of the world can be reflected within it. In this regard, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which has now become the African Union, seeks two permanent seats and a total of five non-permanent seats for the African continent. Of course, Côte d'Ivoire supports this position.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa19">To make the reform of the Security Council a reality, it is essential for Member States of the United Nations, particularly the five permanent members of the Council, to demonstrate their firm will and commitment to carry out these reforms. The primary duty of the United Nations, after all, is to preserve and promote peace throughout the world based on democratic principles. But can there be peace without justice or equality in relations between nations?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa20">The world as a whole and the African continent in particular, has been torn apart by regional conflicts and civil wars that threaten international peace and security. Various solutions proposed by the international community for laying down arms and for halting the suffering of civilian populations have not yet, unfortunately, produced the expected results. We need to find innovative and imaginative solutions that are political, not military. In this perspective, we welcome the Brahimi report on peacekeeping operations, and we hope that its recommendations are applied as soon as possible. The impetus that the Brahimi report is intended to give to peacekeeping operations has to be encouraged and maintained.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa21">The events of 11 September 2001 confirm the Côte d'Ivoire in its condemnation of all terrorist acts as criminal and unjustifiable, wherever they may be carried out and whoever the perpetrators may be, particularly those that violate the purposes and principles of the United Nations, pose a threat to international peace and security and jeopardize friendly relations between countries. This is why the Government of Côte d'Ivoire welcomes and firmly encourages the rapid conclusion of a general convention on international terrorism. Such a convention would undoubtedly contribute greatly to fighting against this scourge and would reinforce an international legal regime on terrorism. Côte d'Ivoire will always respect the international commitments it has assumed since its independence. We also feel that the rule of law should be given top priority.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa22">We would like to pay a well-deserved tribute here to the International Law Commission for its valuable contribution to the development and codification of international law, in particular law relating to the responsibility of States, diplomatic protection, unilateral acts of States, reservations to treaties and international responsibility in case of damaging consequences arising from activities that are not prohibited by international law.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg032-bk02-pa23">At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the role of the United Nations is crucial. Our Organization represents, in fact, the collective conscience and is, as a rule, the policeman of the world, able to balance the interests of States -- those well endowed and those not so well endowed -- within the new globalizing economy. This regulatory role for the world economy and for international relations can be carried out fully only in an environment of international peace, justice and equity.</div>

	Mr. Al-Hinai (Oman)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa01">I wish to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on his assumption of the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that his skills, competence and experience in international affairs will facilitate his task of leading and enriching the work of this session and of bringing it to a successful conclusion with the desired results. We assure him of our delegation's cooperation in the attainment of our shared objectives. We also want to express our sincerest thanks and appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, former Prime Minister of the friendly country of the Republic of Finland. We thank him for his efforts in directing the work of the last session and the various special sessions that took place during his term.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa02">I want to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincerest congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the United Nations itself on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This is a well-deserved award and a mark of distinction for the contributions and the remarkable role played by the Secretary-General and the United Nations in the maintenance and the strengthening of international peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa03">On behalf of my delegation, I also want to express my sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General on being granted a second term of office at the head of the Organization. We intend to cooperate with him in the attainment of our objectives, in the fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and in the preparation and development of mechanisms for international cooperation in all fields.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa04">The terrible events of 11 September that struck this city, which is host to our Organization, have been forcefully condemned by my Government. This city has attracted people from all over the world to a dialogue among civilizations through our international Organization, and it therefore deserves to be a city of peace, not of terror and violence. We therefore take this opportunity to express once again our sincerest condolences to the families of the victims and to the friendly American people, whose sorrow we share. The world was horrified by this dangerous turn of events -- the terrorist acts that struck such vital sites in New York and Washington, taking many lives and leaving great destruction in their wake.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa05">While expressing our solidarity with the friendly country of the United States of America in its struggle against terrorism and in the defence of its territory and its people, and while we understand the reasons for the military action being taken in Afghanistan, it is our fervent hope that every effort will be made to spare innocent civilians the destruction and disasters of war so that they will not suffer further tragedies. For its part, the international community must play its role in protecting the Afghan people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa06">We must not forget the peaceful means of dealing with terrorism. Every sincere effort must be made to eliminate the scourge of terrorism, which will destroy civilization and all the achievements of humankind if it is not firmly confronted and if its causes are not examined and uprooted. We stress that the use of military force is not the best or the only solution for eliminating terrorist groups. We appeal for a long-term vision to prevail so that all elements of the problem can be dealt with. In this respect, we reiterate our welcoming of the Egyptian proposal for an international conference on the fight against terrorism in order to arrive at an effective, binding international instrument for States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa07">In the midst of this tragedy, we have heard certain opportunistic political circles in States and at the international level linking terrorism to Islam and Muslims. We fully and categorically reject this. Islam is a religion of mercy for all, a religion based on fraternity and tolerance. Muslims are the bearers of a civilization, a culture and noble human and humanitarian values. This is why the Organization of the Islamic Conference, at its extraordinary session held in Doha, Qatar, last October, totally dissociated itself from all terrorism and reiterated its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The session's final communiqué reported in paragraph 3 that the Conference</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg034-bk02-pa08">"stressed that such shameful terror acts are opposed to the tolerant, divine message of Islam which spurns aggression, calls for peace, coexistence, tolerance and respect among people, highly prizes the dignity of human life and prohibits killing of the innocent. It further rejected any attempts alleging the existence of any connection or relation between the Islamic faith and the terrorist acts as such attempts are not in the interest of the multilateral efforts to combat terrorism and further damage relations among peoples of the world. It stressed as well the need to undertake a joint effort to promote dialogue and create links or contacts between the Islamic world and the West in order to reach mutual understanding and build bridges of confidence between the two civilizations."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa09">In this respect, my delegation wishes to emphasize its categorical rejection of the calls of all those who would like to use this human disaster to settle old scores and old political differences and to expand the field of military action to other areas under the pretext of fighting terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa10">We are concerned about the humanitarian situation of the friendly Afghan people. International humanitarian organizations report that the military action taking place in Afghanistan has caused hundreds of civilian casualties, that hundreds of thousands have been displaced and that the civilian population is experiencing severe living conditions. Humanitarian organizations have warned that a humanitarian disaster could be imminent for the Afghan people, especially with the approach of winter. My country supports international efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the Afghan people, especially through the recent resolution adopted at the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Conference of the Islamic Conference with a view to creating a fund for this purpose.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa11">The series of difficult and painful events in the peace process in the Middle East on all its tracks and at all its stages, particularly regarding the Palestinian aspect of the question, confirms that in order to arrive at a just, comprehensive and lasting peace it is necessary to work towards implementing Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-242(1967).pdf">242 (1967)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-338(1973).pdf">338 (1973)</a>, as well as all other relevant United Nations resolutions that demand the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied in 1967 and recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of its own independent State, with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital. This is a basic, just and legitimate demand for the purpose of consolidating the pillars of peace and stability in the region. We express our full support for these just demands of the Palestinian people who are fully entitled to use all means available to them to put an end to the Israeli occupation of their territory.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa12">The Islamic countries also support the right of the Palestinian people because of the justness of their cause. Theirs is a legitimate right recognized and guaranteed by all international norms and instruments. The Sultanate of Oman invites the United Nations and the Security Council to assume their full responsibility to have Israel implement all relevant Security Council and international resolutions and to stop the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa13">Following the Madrid Peace Conference, in 1991, the region was full of hope and optimism. It seemed as though peace were becoming a reality. Many agreements had been reached, from Oslo to Sharm el-Sheikh, and all the parties had embarked on dialogue with one another in circumstances that were not ideal. Nonetheless, despite all the missteps, peace moved forward, because peace was the ultimate goal that everyone eagerly sought. The Arabs believed in peace. They had agreed to it as an irreversible strategic option based on the principles of Islam, which advocates tolerance and peace, and because they were convinced that peace alone would make prosperity, stability and development possible.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa14">The Sultanate of Oman has therefore supported every effort, with a view to achieving that much-desired peace based on justice, fairness and the legality of international resolutions and the principle of land for peace. But Israel deviated from those principles, inventing its own concept of peace. Israel has used every possible means of imposing its own kind of peace. Israel does not really want the peace that the world is considering. Israel wants its own special kind of peace. It wants the international community to go along with the current reality -- the occupation of territory, without giving the Palestinians any role or a State. This is why violence in the region is a dynamic of action and reaction. This is why there has been bloodshed and why life and property continue to be destroyed. Will the world stand by and watch the killing of innocents, the murder of the elderly and children?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa15">The Sultanate of Oman therefore invites the two sponsors of the peace process -- the United States of America and the Russian Federation -- and the Secretary-General to play their role so that the situation can return to normal and so that the peace process, in all its aspects, can be revived and resumed from the point where it left off.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa16">My Government supports the just position of the fraternal Syrian Arab Republic. Its actions are aimed at recovering the occupied territory of the Golan Heights and at ensuring Israel's withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 border. In our opinion, it is in Israel's interest to resume the negotiations, in accordance with the principles of international law and international resolutions including Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-242(1967).pdf">242 (1967)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-338(1973).pdf">338 (1973)</a>, as well as the principle of land for peace, in order to lay the foundation for peace and security, so that an effective partnership can be built and a lasting, stable and viable relationship based on mutual interests among the States of the region can be established and consolidated.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa17">My Government also asks Israel to work towards the full implementation of Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">resolution 425 (1978)</a>, which calls upon Israel to withdraw from all Lebanese territory. The Shab'a farms area is an integral part of Lebanese territory and is covered by that resolution. It is in Israel's interest to withdraw from that territory in order to broaden the prospects of peace and to strengthen peace and stability, which everyone desires.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa18">The imposition of sanctions as a political mechanism means that Governments must fulfil their obligations under international resolutions. However, we see that this policy has become a weapon that jeopardizes the fundamental rights of peoples. This is unacceptable. Hence, it is important that the Security Council seek effective policies and mechanisms that take into account the extent to which resolutions have been implemented by the countries to which those resolutions are addressed, such as Iraq, Libya and others.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa19">Despite all the serious international and regional efforts to relieve the suffering of the fraternal Iraqi people, we note that the overall situation in Iraq and the future of the Iraqi people are becoming increasingly problematic because of the economic embargo imposed on them in 1990. That is also the view of the humanitarian and international agencies and organizations in Iraq.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa20">The Sultanate of Oman supports all efforts to lift completely the economic sanctions against Iraq. At the same time, we call upon the Iraqi Government to cooperate constructively with the United Nations in order to implement the remaining relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly regarding prisoners of war, missing Kuwaitis and missing persons from third States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa21">The Sultanate of Oman warmly welcomes the wise approach of our brethren in Bahrain and Qatar. Those two countries have proceeded to implement the Judgment of the International Court of Justice of 16 March 2001. That positive approach by those two fraternal countries has eliminated many sources of tension and has made a genuine contribution to the establishment of peace, security and stability in the region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa22">My Government is gratified by the friendly official contacts between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which will enable those two countries to agree on joint means to put an end to their dispute over the three islands belonging to the Emirates.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa23">The political, economic, social and cultural changes taking place in today's world mean that African countries and their leaders must work hard to build trust among their peoples and their countries so that they can cooperate on the basis of common interest and constructive dialogue and so that they can take local measures and initiatives to resolve all their disputes and to solve the refugee problem. We call on the international community, as represented by the United Nations, to take equitable measures to improve the situation in Africa and to make it possible to resolve its political, economic, social and health problems.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa24">Because of the great importance that the Sultanate of Oman attaches to development, we are pleased that the first International Conference on Financing for Development will take place in Mexico in 2002 and that this date is in the near future. We appreciate the value of dialogue between the rich countries of the North and the countries of the South that are bedevilled by social and environmental problems, and we hope that contacts and dialogue between the two groups will increase genuine cooperation and coordination among States in all fields, with a view to narrowing the economic and technological gap between their peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa25">Over the past 30 years of Oman's development process, my Government has constantly worked to balance development and environmental protection. Such efforts have been successful thanks to His Majesty the Sultan's declaration of 2001 as the Year of the Environment. In the framework of our contribution and of our interest in global environmental issues, we have pledged that we will sign all conventions and treaties aimed at protecting the Earth's environment. My country today appeals to developed countries to meet the commitments they undertook at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro, especially with respect to the provision of technical assistance to developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa26">In the light of the importance of integration into the world economy, my country officially joined the World Trade Organization on 9 November 2000. We hope thus to enhance the role and the level of our trade and industrial organizations and services and to ensure that they are duly integrated into world markets. My country has undertaken great economic reforms to liberalize trade and investment. We have also enacted many laws and have strengthened our mechanisms and regulations in these areas.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa27">I should mention that, on 20 December 2000 at New York, the Sultanate of Oman signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. We hope to complete the ratification process and thus to accede to this new organ of international law, which is aimed at bringing to justice those who violate human rights and commit crimes against humanity, wherever they may be.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa28">We thank the Secretary-General for his annual report on the work of the Organization (<a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-1">A/56/1</a>). It sets out the achievements of the United Nations while describing the obstacles in its way, and it charts a course for the future to strengthen our work towards the purposes for which the United Nations was established. In his report, the Secretary-General also discusses the implementation of the Millennium Declaration and its ambitious recommendations. We must be ready now to endorse visions that would strengthen the United Nations and restructure it in line with current realities. That includes enlargement of the Security Council in a manner proportionate to the overall membership of the international community. In that way the Organization can serve as an effective intermediary in international life and a source of international law.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg034-bk02-pa29">It is our hope that this session will be successful, and that it will set out a vision of the future that will define the contours of future action for the benefit of all mankind.</div>

The British Government maintains that the British Indian Ocean Territory is British and that it has been since 1814. It does not recognize the sovereignty claim of the Government of Mauritius.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg038-bk02-pa02">However, the British Government has recognized Mauritius as the only State which has a right to assert a claim of sovereignty when the United Kingdom relinquishes its own sovereignty. Successive British Governments have given undertakings to the Government of Mauritius that the Territory will be ceded when it is no longer required for defence purposes, subject to the requirements of international law. The British Government remains open to discussions regarding arrangements governing the British Indian Ocean Territory or the future of the Territory. The British Government has stated that, when the time comes for the Territory to be ceded, it will engage in close liaison with the Government of Mauritius.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg038-bk03-pa01"></i> My delegation has asked to exercise its right of reply to clarify and correct some of the information in the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Acting Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait. My delegation would like to say the following.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg038-bk03-pa02">First, the Acting Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait stated that his country was under constant threats to its security and sovereignty. We would like to make it clear to the General Assembly that since the ceasefire, Iraq has made no threats against Kuwait. We would like to remind the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait that Iraq is under constant attack by American and British planes, and these attacks have claimed many victims, including innocent civilians. This military aggression is launched from Kuwaiti land, waters and airspace. These daily attacks are documented by the United Nations. Therefore, Kuwait and the other aggressive States must shoulder their full international responsibilities. Iraq reserves its juridical right to ask for compensation as a result of its constant losses, in accordance with international liability law.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg038-bk03-pa03">Secondly, as regards missing persons, everyone knows that Iraq has often stated that no Kuwaiti or non-Kuwaiti prisoners of war can be found within its borders. In fact, Iraq freed all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners of war as soon as the ceasefire was established under Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991).pdf">resolution 687 (1991)</a>. This resolution also covered the freeing of Iraqi prisoners of war, which was one of the ceasefire conditions. That is why Iraq had no interest in keeping any Kuwaiti or non-Kuwaiti prisoners of war.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg038-bk03-pa04">Iraq asks Kuwait to no longer politicize the question of missing Kuwaiti prisoners of war. This matter should be settled through bilateral negotiations or under the aegis of the Arab League. Through the Assembly, I would also like to appeal again to our Kuwaiti brothers to establish direct bilateral negotiations in order to solve this humanitarian problem. I wish to remind Kuwait and the General Assembly that Iraq has provided over 1,042 files on missing Iraqi civilian and military personnel to the intermediary of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Government of Kuwait, however, has provided us with no information on the missing Iraqis. For the same humanitarian reasons cited by the Acting Prime Minister of Kuwait, we would like to ask Kuwait to cooperate with us in providing necessary information on the fate of missing Iraqis.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg039-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Al-Otaibi" nation="Kuwait" language="Arabic">
	Mr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg039-bk01-pa01"></i> I am very sorry to have to ask to exercise my right of reply at this late hour, but I can see that the incorrect information presented by Iraq requires clarification and rectification.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg039-bk01-pa02">We have heard that Iraq has never threatened Kuwait since the ceasefire. This is obviously erroneous, as stated by Acting Prime Minister Sheikh Eabah al-Ahmad. He stated that there had in fact been many declarations threatening and undermining the security and sovereignty of Kuwait, and this has been borne out by many of Iraq's recent activities. Iraq has refused to renew the commitment on the independence, security and sovereignty of Kuwait, which led to the Arab Summit's lack of success. Kuwait has sent many letters to the Security Council alerting it to various statements, including those by President Saddam Hussein, and these letters have been published as official documents of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg039-bk01-pa03">It seems to me that what Iraq has said concerning American and British planes is a question of the no-flight zones. As for support for these flights, the zones were set up to ensure Iraq's commitment to abide by Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991).pdf">resolution 687 (1991)</a>. There is an agreement between Iraq and the coalition countries concerning ceasefire arrangements. According to its terms, these planes are to fly over Iraq and do not need to be based in Kuwait or anywhere else. A number of aircraft carriers off Kuwait are available to support such flights. Therefore, we reject such allegations and would like to ask Iraq to abide by all its commitments to relevant Security Council resolutions. Only in this way can we achieve the general objective of ensuring peace and stability in this vital region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg039-bk01-pa04">As to prisoners of war and missing persons, we are very sorry to hear what Iraq has said on this subject. It is by no means new; we have heard such erroneous information before. For over 10 years now, since the liberation of Kuwait, Iraq has not complied with the relevant resolutions on this subject, including resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991).pdf">687 (1991)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1284(1999).pdf">1284 (1999)</a>. A number of presidential press statements were made during the Tripartite Commission meeting asking Iraq to settle this question and to cooperate with Mr. Yuli Vorontsov, the high-level Coordinator of the Secretary-General on this matter. Unfortunately, Iraq has not yet responded to those statements. We hope that the Government of Iraq will change its position on this matter and not subject it to any political concessions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg039-bk01-pa05">The representative of Iraq has pointed out that Kuwait has to settle this matter through bilateral negotiations or through the League of Arab States. We have in fact rejected that Iraqi proposal because it establishes unnecessary mechanisms. There are already international mechanisms in existence, namely, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Tripartite Commission headed by the high-level Coordinator appointed by the Secretary-General in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1284(1999).pdf">resolution 1284 (1999)</a>, Mr. Yuli Vorontsov. The basic objective of the Iraqi proposal is to take this humanitarian issue outside the Security Council framework and to further delay a resolution of this matter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg039-bk01-pa06">With regard to missing Iraqi persons, we wish to say the following. If the Iraqi Government were indeed serious about discovering the fate of those missing persons, why does it not participate in the process set up by the Red Cross and the Tripartite Commission in this regard? Kuwait had from the outset, for humanitarian reasons, cooperated fully with the Red Cross to solve this humanitarian issue, although it falls outside the purview of Security Council resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg039-bk01-pa07">Kuwait had to submit to Iraqi occupation, and this is just a way of diverting attention from that fact.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg040-bk01-pa02">The question of the no-flight zones has already been dealt with and resolved through several United Nations resolutions and by the Secretary-General. Statements have been made to the effect that such zones are not based on any resolution of the Security Council, and are thus established in violation of Council resolutions and constitute an attack on Iraq. Therefore any facilities provided by Kuwait to the aggressors' planes are in violation of the Charter. Kuwait is responsible for that under international law, as are the aggressor countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg040-bk01-pa03">My Government reiterates its sincere invitation to Kuwait to begin direct bilateral negotiations or negotiations under the auspices of the Arab League to take up the issue of missing Kuwaitis and Iraqis.

	<div class="p" id="pg040-bk02-pa01">I am sorry for taking the floor once again. I shall be very brief.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg040-bk02-pa02">I shall not repeat what has already been said with regard to the no-flight zones. But, with respect to Iraq's appeal to Kuwait to resolve bilaterally the question of prisoners of war and missing persons, our position is well known. In my first statement in exercise of the right of reply, I said that Kuwait refuses to create any new mechanisms to deal with this humanitarian problem. If Iraq were really serious and sincere, it would cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross and would participate in its meetings. Why does Iraq not cooperate with the high-level Coordinator appointed by the Secretary-General for that purpose? Why create new mechanisms? I have already said that the reason Iraq has tried to take this issue outside the framework of United Nations resolutions is because it wants to weaken the issue and delay the resolution of the matter. If Iraq really is sincere, why should we create a new international mechanism?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg040-bk02-pa03">Finally, I would like to reaffirm what the Acting Prime Minister of Kuwait said in his statement. All that we ask of Iraq is for it to implement the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. This has been called for not only in the United Nations, but also at meetings of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement. The entire international community is demanding that Iraq implement international resolutions.</div>
