	<div class="p"><b>  </b>My delegation is taking the floor to welcome the appointment of Mr. Supachai Panitchpakdi, a Thai national, to the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). We are particularly pleased that the due process of consultations with Member States has taken place over the past two months.</div>
	<div class="p">We thank the Secretary-General for recognizing the special importance that the Group of 77 and China has accorded to UNCTAD and to the selection of the head of that organization. We also appreciate the opportunity for an exchange of views on 6 May between the Group of 77 and China and the nominee, which resulted in today's confirmation of the appointment. As we are all making our best efforts to reform the United Nations, we certainly welcome the increased openness and transparency in the selection process, and we are encouraged by the Secretary-General's efforts towards that commendable trend.</div>
	<div class="p">Thailand has always attached great importance to the work of UNCTAD as a main agency for trade and development policies. Thailand hosted UNCTAD X in 2000 and, subsequently, the mid-term review in 2002, and we have always supported the work of UNCTAD. We are especially proud to see a Thai national moving on from the World Trade Organization to take the driver's seat at UNCTAD, with his full recognition of the concerns of developing countries. We are convinced that the new Secretary-General of UNCTAD will work to strengthen and revitalize the agency and enable it to respond more effectively to the needs of developing countries, the least developed countries, landlocked countries, small island developing countries, countries with economies in transition and middle-income countries. We pledge our full support to him, and we wish him every success in his endeavour.</div>
