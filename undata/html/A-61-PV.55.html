<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">As indicated in <a href="../pdf/A-61-109.pdf" class="pdf">document A/61/109</a>, the General Assembly is required, during the sixty-first session, to appoint five members to fill the vacancies in the Joint Inspection Unit that will arise from the expiration of the term of office, on 31 December 2007, of Mr. Even Fontaine Ortiz of Cuba, Mr. Tang Guanging of China, Mr. Victor Vislykh of the Russian Federation, Ms. Deborah Wynes of the United States of America and Mr. Muhammad Yussuf of the United Republic of Tanzania.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">As is also indicated in <a href="../pdf/A-61-109.pdf" class="pdf">document A/61/109</a>, in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, the President of the General Assembly shall consult with Member States to draw up a list of countries -- in this case, five countries -- that would be requested to propose a candidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">After holding the necessary consultations with the regional groups, I should like to communicate to the Assembly the following information that I have received from the Chairmen of the regional groups.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">For the single seat from among the Group of African States, there are three candidates, namely, Egypt, the Sudan and the United Republic of Tanzania.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">For the single seat from among the Group of Asian States, the Group has endorsed China.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">For the single seat from among the Group of Eastern European States, the group has endorsed the Russian Federation.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa07">For the single seat from among the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Group has endorsed Cuba.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa08">For the single seat from among the Group of Western European and other States, the Group has endorsed the United States of America.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa09">As the Groups of Asian States, Eastern European States, Latin American and Caribbean States and Western European and other States have each endorsed one candidate for one vacancy -- namely, China, the Russian Federation, Cuba and the United States of America, respectively -- those four countries will be requested to propose a candidate each for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa10">Since there are three candidacies from among the African States for one vacancy, I should like, in accordance with past practice, to consult with Member States through the procedure of holding an advisory vote by secret ballot to select one country from among the African States to be requested to propose a candidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa11">Although that advisory vote would not be an election, we would follow the rules of procedure of the Assembly governing elections. If there is no objection, may I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>

<div class="italicline" id="pg002-bk01">
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">It was so decided.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01"> In accordance with existing practice, the country receiving the greatest number of votes, and not less than a majority of the votes of those present and voting, shall be the country selected to propose a candidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">May I remind members that the Assembly is not appointing members to the Joint Inspection Unit at this time. It is only selecting one country, which will be requested to propose a candidate. Therefore, only the name of a country, and not the name of an individual, should appear on the ballot paper.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">I should now like to repeat the names of the three countries from among the African States that wish to propose a candidate: Egypt, the Sudan and the United Republic of Tanzania.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">I should furthermore like to point out that, from among the African States, Senegal already has a national serving on the Joint Inspection Unit. The name of that State should therefore not appear on ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">The Assembly will now proceed to the selection of one country from among the African States that will be requested to propose a candidate to fill the vacancy in the Joint Inspection Unit.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa05">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa06">We shall now begin the voting process. Members are requested to remain seated until all ballots have been collected.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa07">Ballot papers will now be distributed. May I request representatives to write on the ballot papers the name of the one State for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers containing more than one name will be declared invalid. If a ballot paper contains the name of a Member State that does not belong to the region, that ballot paper will be declared invalid. Ballot papers bearing the name of an individual will not be counted at all.</p>
