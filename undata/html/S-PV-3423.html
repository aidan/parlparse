	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1026.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1026</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 2 September 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">&quot;The Security Council takes note of the information conveyed to it by the Secretariat on the situation in Angola, in particular in the light of UNITA's letter of 5 September 1994 to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. The Council considers this letter as constituting the required formal acceptance by UNITA of the complete set of proposals on national reconciliation, which were submitted to it on 28 May 1994 by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Representatives of the three observer States of the Angolan peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council welcomes this development. By accepting the complete set of proposals, UNITA has met the requirements demanded in this regard in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-932(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 932 (1994)</a>. In this context and in view of the current negotiations, the Council has agreed not to consider, at present, the imposition of additional measures against UNITA as indicated in paragraph 26 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council considers that, following the acceptance by both the Government of Angola and UNITA of the complete set of proposals on national reconciliation, the way is now clear for an early conclusion of the negotiations in Lusaka towards a comprehensive agreement within the framework of the 'Acordos de Paz' and relevant Security Council resolutions. It urges both parties to reach such an agreement before the expiry of the present mandate of UNAVEM II on 30 September 1994. It reiterates its intention to reconsider the future role of the United Nations in Angola in the event a peace agreement is not concluded by that date.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Security Council remains deeply concerned by the continuation of the armed conflict in Angola. It reiterates its demand that the parties cease all offensive military actions and reminds them again that all such actions threaten the prospects for a negotiated peace. Attempts to gain short-term military advantage and to procrastinate at the Lusaka peace talks will only prolong the conflict and the continued suffering of the Angolan people and discourage the involvement of the international community in assisting Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Security Council expresses its grave concern about any act against United Nations and other international personnel in Angola, and calls upon all parties to ensure the safety and security of the staff and property of the United Nations and all humanitarian organizations. The Security Council stresses the importance of facilitating the free and unrestricted movement of humanitarian relief supplies and humanitarian assistance workers throughout the territory of Angola.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-52.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/52</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
