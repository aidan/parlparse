<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p"><b>  </b>The General Assembly will proceed to the election of 14 permanent judges of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 for a four-year term of office commencing on 17 November 2005.</div>
	<div class="p">At the election of judges in 2001, 14 permanent judges were elected for a term of four years that will expire on 16 November 2005.</div>
	<div class="p">In connection with the election today of the 14 permanent judges, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">First, according to article 13 bis, paragraph 1, of the statute of the International Tribunal as amended by Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1166(1998)">1166 (1998)</a> of 13 May 1998 and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1329(2000)">1329 (2000)</a> of 30 November 2000, the 14 permanent judges of the International Tribunal shall be elected by the General Assembly from a list of candidates submitted by the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p">At its 5057th meeting, on 14 October 2004, the Security Council, in accordance with article 13 bis, subparagraph 1 (c) of the statute of the International Tribunal, established in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1567(2004)">resolution 1567 (2004)</a> a list of 22 candidates, taking due account of the adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the world. The list was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by a letter dated 14 October 2004 from the President of the Security Council. The letter was issued as document <a href="../pdf/A-59-437">A/59/437</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, in accordance with article 13 bis, subparagraph 1 (d) of the statute of the International Tribunal, the Holy See, a non-Member State maintaining a permanent observer mission at United Nations Headquarters, shall participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. On this occasion, I am happy to welcome here the representative of the Holy See.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning the election of judges of the International Tribunal is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-59-438">A/59/438</a>. The list of 22 candidates can be found in paragraph 7 of the same document.</div>
	<div class="p">The curricula vitae of the 22 candidates are contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-59-439">A/59/439</a>. In that connection, may I bring to the Assembly's attention the provision of article 13 of the statute of the International Tribunal, which reads as follows:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The permanent and ad litem judges shall be persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices. In the overall composition of the Chambers and sections of the Trial Chambers, due account shall be taken of the experience of the judges in criminal law, international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law."</div>
	<div class="p">As representatives are aware, the election of judges will take place in accordance with the relevant provisions of article 13 bis of the statute of the International Tribunal.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, given the similar nature of the election of judges of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the International Tribunal, it was decided at the time of the elections of judges in 1993, as well as in 1997, 1998 and 2001, to follow similar election procedures in the General Assembly. In his memorandum, the Secretary-General suggests that those precedents be applied to the election of judges of the International Tribunal.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to that suggestion?</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="2-6">

	<div class="p"><b> </b>In accordance with article 13 bis, subparagraph 1 (d) of the statute of the International Tribunal, the candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the non-member State shall be declared elected. The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for that purpose, are all 191 Member States and one non-member State, the Holy See. Accordingly, 97 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of electing judges of the International Tribunal.</div>
	<div class="p">If, in the first ballot, the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than 14, a second ballot will be held and balloting will continue in the same meeting until 14 candidates have obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p">Following the practice in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, the Secretary-General suggests in his memorandum that any second and subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted. It is further suggested that, following the practice in the election of the judges of the International Court of Justice, if more than 14 candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will be held on all candidates and balloting will continue at the same meeting until 14 candidates, and no more, have obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to the procedures I have just outlined?</div>

	<div class="p"><b>  </b>I would like to remind the General Assembly that tomorrow, Saturday, 20 November 2004, is Africa Industrialization Day.</div>
	<div class="p">I will now deliver the message of the President of the General Assembly on the occasion of Africa Industrialization Day.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"On 20 November, the United Nations family observes Africa Industrialization Day with the collective spirit of supporting and promoting the sustainable industrial development efforts of the continent. The theme for this year's Africa Industrialization Day is `Strengthening Productive Capacity for Poverty Reduction within the Framework of the New Partnership for Africa's Development'.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Poverty remains a big challenge for Africa. To achieve the Millennium Development Goals, particularly the halving of income poverty, the African economies must grow. The estimates show that annual gross domestic product per capita growth rates of 2 to 6 per cent are required to meet that Goal. In that context, productivity enhancement plays a leading role.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"As a key component of productivity, successful industrialization is the motive force for applying new technologies and entrepreneurship development in Africa. It provides an enabling environment for human capital development, promotes institutional change, modernizes the export structure, as well as creates new employment opportunities.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"To alleviate poverty, African countries must introduce good industrial policies and promote domestic and foreign investment, expansion of markets, infrastructure development, employment and technological change. That goal can be pursued through regional integration and economic cooperation to gain access to international markets.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The leading role played by the regional economic communities and the private sector in strengthening the productive capacities of the manufacturing sector is important to ensure sustained growth. With that aim, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the Conference of the African Ministers of Industry have jointly launched the African Productive Capacity Initiative, which was endorsed by the African Union Summit in July 2004 as the industrial component of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The Initiative will spell out policies and measures enabling African countries to enhance their productive capacities through a value chain approach and regional integration and enter the global production network.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"We are happy to see that, recognizing the importance of industry as a strategic factor of economic development, NEPAD foresees strong industrial policies that will help African countries strengthen their productive capacities and ability to fight poverty. I am confident that Africa, with its vast human and natural resources and strong commitment to the Development Goals, will be able to achieve the objectives of NEPAD.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"In that context, I would like to urge the international community to enhance its support for the productive capacity-building efforts of African countries in order to help them achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the objectives of NEPAD.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The strategy for strengthening the productive capacity for poverty reduction in Africa within the framework of NEPAD is undoubtedly a step in the right direction.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"This is a day to renew and reconfirm our commitment to working in global partnership and to contributing towards sustainable industrial development as an effective tool for poverty reduction in Africa."</div>

	<div class="p">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the delegations of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.</div>
	<div class="p">In 2005, the entire world will celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the victory over fascism. The great triumph of the Second World War was the result of the joint efforts of the peoples of many countries and was the primary impulse leading the international community to establish the United Nations. Through the suffering and death of millions, the peoples of the world have come to see the irreplaceable nature of the international security system that the United Nations embodies in the maintenance of international peace.</div>
	<div class="p">Today, it is important to recall the lessons of the Second World War and the memory of those who died in it, and to unite the efforts of the international community, through the central role of the United Nations, to face the new threats and challenges emerging in the world. The Member States must come together to address new challenges, to achieve the pacific settlement of disputes, to deal with conflicts in the future and to strengthen the maintenance of stable and lasting peace.</div>
	<div class="p">In the general interests of humankind, we will need to further strengthen the role and efficiency of the United Nations as a central element in the system of collective security in order to implement the widely hailed objectives of the Charter and to save peoples from the scourge of war.</div>
	<div class="p">Today, the General Assembly is considering the draft resolution on the declaration by the United Nations of 8 and 9 May as days of remembrance and reconciliation, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.28-Rev.1">A/59/L.28/Rev.1</a>. We believe that the General Assembly will support that important collective and universal initiative and help to mobilize efforts to maintain a secure and equitable world order in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The General Assembly will hold a special solemn meeting on 9 May 2005 in commemoration of the sacrifices made during the war, at which a declaration will be made to encourage general progress and the avoidance of new wars.</div>
	<div class="p">We hope that the draft resolution will be adopted without a vote. Bearing in mind the fact that certain delegations have asked for more time to work on the draft, we suggest that the adoption of a decision on it be postponed until Monday, 22 November.</div>

	<div class="p">I have the honour to speak briefly on behalf of the European Union.</div>
	<div class="p">To the European Union member States, as is the case for many other countries around the world, the war brought unspeakable suffering. It affected the lives of millions of people in Europe and beyond. It changed the fates of individuals, families and whole nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Rightfully, reflection on that suffering and commemoration of the end of that period of extreme horrors are our common duty. It should inspire us -- as individuals, as nations, as organizations -- to do everything in our power to jointly prevent war and violence and to deal in a peaceful manner with the challenges and threats we are facing.</div>
	<div class="p">We should at the same time recognize that, in many respects, progress has been made since the end of the Second World War towards reconciliation, international and regional cooperation, and the promotion of democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms. In fact, our common United Nations and our European Union bear witness to that progress and therefore we hope that we will reach an agreement on the draft resolution just introduced by Vice-Minister Fedotov.</div>
