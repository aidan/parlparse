	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa02">This short procedural resolution takes note of the report (<a href="../pdf/A-50-203.pdf">A/50/203</a>) of the Secretary-General on strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations, of 14 June 1995, as well as the <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/E-RES-1995-56.pdf">Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/56</a> of July 1995. The draft resolution decides to refer further deliberations on these matters, including those related to the Central Emergency Revolving Fund, to the substantive session of the Economic and Social Counsel in 1996.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa03">Last year the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-139.pdf">resolution 49/139</a>, which dealt extensively with various aspects of the coordination of humanitarian assistance of the United Nations. In his report, the Secretary-General outlined, <i>inter alia</i>, the need for further strengthening of system-wide coordination in this field. As a result, the Economic and Social Council, in its <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-1995-56.pdf">resolution 1995/56</a>, strongly encouraged Governments to ensure a greater coherence in the direction given to governing bodies of relevant agencies, organizations, programmes and funds of the United Nations system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa04">Relevant organizations of the United Nations were requested to report to the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council in 1996 on progress achieved in a number of areas concerning their role and operational responsibilities as well as operative and financial capacities to respond to broad humanitarian programmes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa05">Sweden has not asked for co-sponsorship of this procedural resolution. The draft resolution was approved in the informal consultations conducted by His Excellency Mr. Sucharipa, Ambassador of Austria, and I hope that it will be adopted by the General Assembly by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa06">Before concluding I would like to pay special tribute to Mr. Peter Hansen, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, and his staff, as well as to the United Nations agencies involved, for their continuous dedication to alleviating the sufferings of the victims of natural disasters and other emergencies.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa01">Under agenda item 20(b), I have the honour to introduce on behalf of the sponsors draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.41.pdf">A/50/L.41</a>, entitled "Assistance for humanitarian relief and the economic and social rehabilitation of Somalia".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa02">The sponsors of the draft resolution are: Algeria, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, India, Kenya, Kuwait, Lesotho, Lebanon, Morocco, Mauritania, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, Yemen and Zimbabwe.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa03">This draft resolution, like <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-21.pdf">resolution 49/21</a> L of 20 December 1994, calls for the continued implementation of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-47-160.pdf">resolution 47/160</a> of 18 December 1992, since the adoption of which United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) forces have been withdrawn; the operation ended in March 1995, as decided by the Security Council in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-954(1994).pdf">resolution 954 (1994)</a> of 4 November 1994. Subsequently, in the presidential statement issued in document S/PRST/1995/15 of 6 April 1995, the Council noted the successful withdrawal of UNOSOM II forces, and welcomed the willingness of international humanitarian assistance agencies and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide assistance for the rehabilitation where conditions permitted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa04">The draft resolution now before us includes a number of changes, in particular in the preambular paragraphs, which take into account new developments in the country since the adoption of the last resolution, as the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/A-50-447.pdf">A/50/447</a>) emphasized.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa05">It is important to note with appreciation that following the departure of UNOSOM II forces Somalia has not returned to widespread anarchy and general disorder to the extent that had been feared. It has, on the contrary, as the report of the Secretary-General emphasizes, gradually committed itself to rehabilitation and reconstruction. This should make us all relieved and give us encouragement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa06">However, the country's political instability and lack of central authority continue to create a climate of insecurity and provide fertile soil for new emergencies, particularly among the vulnerable groups: infants, women, the elderly, the refugees and the disabled.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa07">Although the humanitarian situation is still fragile and precarious, in most regions of the country it is time to begin the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction. The United Nations agencies have accordingly decided to make efforts to launch this process even before national reconciliation is fully achieved. We welcome the efforts of these agencies and their partners to establish and maintain efficient coordination and cooperation mechanisms to provide for the delivery of assistance and work for rehabilitation and reconstruction following the withdrawal of UNOSOM II. This work is vital and should be encouraged.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa08">The draft resolution welcomes the United Nations current strategy focusing on community-based interventions aimed at rebuilding local infrastructures and increasing the self-reliance of the local population.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa09">Operative paragraph 5 urges all States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue the further implementation of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-47-160.pdf">resolution 47/160</a> of 18 December 1992. Those who realize that vital economic and social services and public administration have been totally destroyed in Somalia by a protracted fratricidal conflict will find it easy to understand the full justification and urgency of such an appeal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa10">Three or four years ago the tragedy of Somalia caught our attention and touched the emotions of all of us. Today even the most generous people feel little more than a kind of guilty indifference towards that country. The complexity of the tangled problem of Somalia has led to a certain regrettable lack of interest in the tragedy, which continues to imperil the lives of millions of human beings and the survival of a sovereign nation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa11">The General Assembly is the last resort in order to reverse the course of this bleak history, the history of a Member country of this Organization. Somalia deserves our attention. Somalia needs renewal. The Somalis have the right to life.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa12">Therefore, on behalf of all the sponsors, I make a friendly but pressing appeal to all delegations to adopt draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.41.pdf">A/50/L.41</a> without a vote.</div>

The report, which is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-50-48-Rev.1.pdf">A/50/48/Rev.1</a> and Corr.1, was adopted by the Preparatory Committee at its thirty-fourth meeting on 5 December 1995. The report contains five chapters.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa02">The first chapter of the report, entitled "Background and Introduction", covering paragraphs 1-7, recalls that the General Assembly, in its decision 46/472 of 13 April 1992, entrusted the Preparatory Committee, consisting of the members of the General Committee and open to the participation of all Member States, with the task of considering and recommending to the Assembly proposals for suitable activities in connection with the observance of the fiftieth anniversary, on the understanding that all decisions of the Preparatory Committee would be taken by consensus.

The chapter also draws attention to the adoption by the Assembly, on 9 November 1994, of two resolutions: <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-11.pdf">resolution 49/11</a> on the United Nations fiftieth anniversary coin programme, and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-12.pdf">resolution 49/12</a>, on the work of the Preparatory Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa03">I now turn to chapter II, consisting of paragraphs 8 to 20, which is entitled "Preparations for the Special Commemorative Meeting of the General Assembly on the occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary". This chapter consists of two sections: section A, entitled "Procedural and organizational arrangements for the meeting", and section B, entitled "Drafting of the Declaration". This chapter notes that, on the recommendation of the Preparatory Committee, the General Assembly adopted on 24 May 1995 <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-12.pdf">resolution 49/12</a> B, in which it agreed to the procedure by which the order of the list of speakers would be determined; the number of speaking slots, the order of priority; and the time-limit for statements. It also notes that, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-12.pdf">General Assembly resolution 49/12</a> B, the drawing of the lots took place at the twenty-eighth meeting of the Preparatory Committee, on 7 June 1995, resulting in the speakers' list for the Special Commemorative Meeting. This list is presented in annex I of the report. Paragraph 12 of this chapter reflects the decisions of the Preparatory Committee on logistical and substantive matters. This includes the decision that, due to reasons of cost, the statements to be published in the bound volume would be the texts orally delivered at the Special Commemorative Meeting.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa04">I now turn to chapter II, section B, entitled "Drafting of the Declaration", compromising paragraphs 13 to 20. This section notes, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment by the Preparatory Committee of an open-ended drafting group to prepare a solemn declaration to be adopted in 1995 to mark the observance of the anniversary. It was agreed that the Declaration should address the ordinary people of all countries; should not be grandiose; should be substantive in nature; and should reflect a thematic approach. It was also agreed that all decisions by the drafting group should be taken by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa05">The drafting group held 46 meetings and concluded its work on 20 October 1995. The group's work was based, since February 1995, firstly on a draft declaration prepared by the Bureau, to which written amendments were presented by various delegations and groups of countries, and subsequently on "rolling texts", prepared by the Chairman, reflecting the progress of the drafting group's work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa06">The list of the documents utilized by the Preparatory Committee and its drafting group is in annex II of the report. Paragraphs 18 and 19 contain the statement by the Chairman of the drafting group at the conclusion of its work; the decision of the Preparatory Committee to adopt the draft declaration; as well as the statements made after the adoption of the draft declaration by representatives of the following countries: Lebanon, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Ireland, Cuba, the United Kingdom, India, Mexico, Japan, the Russian Federation, Portugal, Pakistan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Norway, Israel, the United States of America and Egypt.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa07">Paragraph 20 reports on the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration at its fortieth meeting, on 24 October 1995. The Declaration was adopted as <a href="../pdf/A-RES-50-6.pdf">resolution 50/6</a>. Its text is in annex III of the report.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa08">I now turn to chapter III of the report, paragraphs 21 to 33. In section A, entitled "Action by Member and observer States, including the establishment of national committees and the issuance of commemorative stamps and coins", it is noted that some 152 national committees had been established as at 10 November 1995. The varied activities taking place at the national level are listed in paragraph 22. These focused primarily on educating youth and informing the public about the United Nations. Paragraph 23 relates to the special issue of stamps and coins, and notes that under the programme participating Member States donate a royalty to the Trust Fund for the Fiftieth Anniversary Celebrations on each proof or uncirculated coin sold to collectors. These royalties are used to support educational and communications activities about the work of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa09">Mention is made in paragraph 24 of the special activities held in San Francisco to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, as well as of the major commemorations undertaken in Geneva, New York and Vienna.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa10">Section B -- paragraphs 25 to 27 -- contains information on global projects undertaken by the secretariat of the fiftieth anniversary. The goals identified by the secretariat and endorsed by the Preparatory Committee were to promote a more balanced image of the United Nations, to enlarge its constituency of support, especially among youth and non-traditional audiences, to improve world-wide education about the work of the United Nations and to mobilize public support for the United Nations. The programmes included a global teach-in for 24 October, United Nations Day; the preparation of educational kits; and exhibitions and media campaigns. A world youth leadership training summit focusing on the rights and responsibilities of youth was held at United Nations Headquarters in August 1995.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa11">Section C -- paragraphs 28 to 31 -- gives information about activities within the United Nations system, organized mainly through the Administrative Committee on Coordination and mobilizing the United Nations field network, the regional commissions and resident representatives. Note should also be taken of the specific activities involving the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations Development Programme. Paragraph 31 reports on the continued efforts to involve staff of the United Nations system and on programmes organized by the staff committees in New York, Geneva and Vienna.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa12">Section D -- paragraphs 32 and 33 -- reports on the important contributions of non-governmental organizations, especially the United Nations associations, to the global commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary. It should be noted that a one-day non-governmental-organization programme to examine the role of the non-governmental organizations and the United Nations and its future in the twenty-first century was held at United Nations Headquarters in November 1995.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa13">Chapter IV of the report -- paragraphs 34 to 36 -- deals with administrative and financial issues. It refers to the fact that, as the financial situation of the Organization precluded making funds available from the regular budget, the Secretary-General established a Trust Fund for the Fiftieth Anniversary Celebrations and received contributions from a number of Member States. Sufficient resources to develop core global activities were obtained from three global sponsors and several major project sponsors. Substantial funds also came from international licensees. It should be noted that the Trust Fund is expected to continue to receive revenue from some of the licensees, particularly with respect to commemorative coins and publications. As noted in paragraph 36, the Trust Fund has had a positive impact in supporting not only global projects, but also national educational and communications initiatives about the work of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa14">Finally, in paragraph 37 of the report, the Preparatory Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution entitled "Work of the Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations". The draft resolution, which was adopted by consensus, reads as follows:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa15">"<i>The General Assembly,</i></div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa16">"<i>Having considered </i>the report of the Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations,</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa18">"2. <i>Also expresses its appreciation </i>to the secretariat of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations for the series of commemorative programmes and projects it has undertaken and coordinated and for its efforts to involve national committees, non-governmental organizations and the United Nations system and staff in the global commemoration of the anniversary;</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa19">"3. <i>Further expresses its appreciation </i>to those Member States, corporations and individuals that have contributed to the Trust Fund for the Fiftieth Anniversary;</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa20">"4. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to ensure that the funds remaining in and which will be paid into the Trust Fund are applied to the purposes for which they were committed, and to report thereon to the General Assembly before the end of the fiftieth session;</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa21">"5. <i>Expresses its deep appreciation </i>to the host country for the arrangements it made in support of the conduct of the special commemorative meeting of the General Assembly;</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa22">"6. <i>Approves </i>the report of the Preparatory Committee, and takes note with deep appreciation of the successful conclusion of its work."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk09-pa23">In closing, I wish to express appreciation to the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, Ambassador Richard Butler of Australia, for having so ably guided the work of the Committee and of the drafting group, and for the skill, patience and endurance he demonstrated. My appreciation goes also to Under-Secretary-General Sorensen and to the staff of the United Nations fiftieth anniversary secretariat, and especially to those who serviced the Preparatory Committee during its deliberations.</div>
