	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa01">I have the honour today to present to the General Assembly the reports of the Fifth Committee during the first part of its resumed fifty-fifth session.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa02">With regard to agenda item 115, entitled "Financial reports and audited financial statements, and reports of the Board of Auditors", the report of the Committee is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-689-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/689/Add.1</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution that was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa03">With regard to agenda item 116, entitled "Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations", the Committee considered the following questions: procurement reform and procurement-related arbitration; the three thematic reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on its follow-up audit of the implementation of procurement reform; the inspection of the outcome of the consolidation of the three former economic and social departments into the Department of Economic and Social Affairs; the inspection of the consolidation of technical support in the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services; and the question of the review of the term of office of the Board of Auditors. The report of the Committee on these questions is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-532-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/532/Add.2</a>. In paragraph 12 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of two draft resolutions and a draft decision, which were adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa04">The Committee also considered the question of gratis personnel under this agenda item, as well as under agenda item 123, entitled "Human resources management". The report of the Committee on this matter is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-852.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/852</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends the adoption of a draft decision, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa05">The report of the Committee regarding questions relating to the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, under agenda item 117, is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-713-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/713/Add.1</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends the adoption of eight drafts decisions on the following questions: Integrated Management Information System; review and assessment of the asbestos problem at the United Nations and the management of asbestos-containing materials at buildings at Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi and at the locations of the regional commissions; facilities management; profitability of the commercial activities of the United Nations; construction of additional conference facilities at Bangkok and Addis Ababa; security arrangements at the United Nations Office at Geneva; common services; and internal and external printing practices of the Organization. These draft decisions were adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa06">As regards the question of the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships, which the Committee considered under two agenda items -- 117, "Programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001", and 168, "Programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999" -- the report of the Committee on the matter is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-876.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/876</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft decision, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa07">Concerning agenda item 120, entitled "Administrative and budgetary coordination of the United Nations with the specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency", the report of the Committee on the statistical report of the Administrative Committee on Coordination on the budgetary and financial situation of organizations of the United Nations system is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-859.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/859</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft decision, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa08">In connection with agenda item 122, "Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations", in particular the application of Article 19 of the United Nations Charter, the Committee decided to inform the General Assembly that it took note of the information provided by the coordinator of the informal consultations on the item to the effect that the question of the application of Article 19 of the Charter should be considered by the Committee on Contributions at its forthcoming session. The report of the Committee on this item is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-521-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/521/Add.2</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa09">As regards agenda item 123, entitled "Human resources management", despite extensive negotiations on a draft resolution on this item, which comprised around 200 paragraphs covering all issues under consideration, and in spite of substantial progress on the greater part of these issues, the Committee was unable to reach consensus or to complete its work for a number of reasons. The Committee still has to deal with the issue of the examination for the promotion from general service to the Professional category, contractual arrangements, recruitment and placement, and the application of the principle of equitable geographic distribution. In a draft decision entitled "Human resources management", the Committee therefore decided to defer consideration of this agenda item to the second part of its resumed session. In paragraph 7 of its report, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-890.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/890</a>, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the draft decision, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>

In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft decision, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa12">As regards agenda item 127, entitled "Financing of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991", the report of the Committee on the proposed requirements for the ad litem judges and the conditions and terms of service of these judges is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-691-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/691/Add.1</a>. In paragraph 8 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of two draft resolutions, which were adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa13">As regards agenda item 127 and agenda item 128, "Financing of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994", the reports of the Committee on the audit and investigation of the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda are contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-55-691-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/691/Add.2</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-55-692-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/692/Add.1</a>.

In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa15">As regards agenda item 132, entitled "Financing of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone", the report of the Committee is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-891.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/891</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa16">Finally, regarding agenda item 176, entitled "Financing of the Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea", the report of the Committee on this item is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-711-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/711/Add.1</a>.

Currently, there are 48 countries in that group, as against 25 in the 1980s. With the adoption of the present draft resolution, one more country will be added to the group. The introduction of this draft resolution, preceding the holding of the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Brussels in May 2001, indicates that the international community has been far less supportive of developing countries in general, and least developed countries in particular. Otherwise, we should have seen their graduation from the list, rather than their inclusion in the group of least developed countries.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk05-pa01">On the occasion of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-253.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/253</a>, I would like to recall that the Committee on Development Policy, in the course of its last triennial review of the list of least developed countries, which was held from 3 to 7 April 2000, recommended that Senegal be placed on that list. The Economic and Social Council therefore recommended in its decision <a href="../pdf/E-2000-34.pdf" class="nolink">E/2000/34</a> that the General Assembly include Senegal on that list, provided the Government of Senegal agreed.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk05-pa02">Clearly, agreeing to this required political courage on the part of the new Senegalese authorities. But it also required a great deal of realism, given the negative connotation attached to something that could be interpreted as a setback. However, the authorities of my country are convinced that, with the support provided by the solidarity of the international community to meet the new challenges confronting Senegal, the redoubled efforts of the Senegalese people will make it possible for Senegal to quickly satisfy the criteria for graduation established by the Committee for Development Policy.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk05-pa03">Before concluding, I would like to thank all the countries that sponsored the resolution. I would like to thank the Islamic Republic of Iran in particular, which spared no effort in this regard in its capacity as Chairman of the Group of 77.</p>
