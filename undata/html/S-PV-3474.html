<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1277.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1277</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 9 November 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council notes with appreciation the progress made by the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan, led by Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri, and the report of the Secretary-General of 22 November 1994 (<a href="../pdf/A-49-688.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/688</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council fully supports the Special Mission's broad-based consultations with Afghan representatives and its proposals to bring about an end to the factional fighting, institute a process of political reconciliation and begin the tasks of rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the acceptance by the warring parties and other Afghan representatives of a step-by-step process of national reconciliation through the establishment of a fully representative and broad-based Authoritative Council, which would: (i) negotiate and oversee a cease-fire, (ii) establish a national security force to collect and safeguard heavy weapons and provide for security throughout the country, and (iii) form a transitional</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">government to lay the groundwork for a democratically chosen government, possibly utilizing traditional decision-making structures such as a Grand Assembly'.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council notes with grave concern, however, the continuation of hostilities among the warring parties in Afghanistan, involving the continued suffering, death and destitution of innocent citizens of the country, and calls for an immediate halt to these pointless and destructive attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council calls upon all States to take the necessary steps to promote peace in Afghanistan; to prevent the continued flow of weapons, ammunition and military supplies to the warring parties in Afghanistan; and to put an end to this destructive conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"Recognizing that the rehabilitation, reconstruction and development of war-torn Afghanistan will be dependent in large part upon the progress made toward the establishment of a reliable cease-fire and the development of a viable political process, the Security Council urges all States to support the peacemaking proposals of the Special Mission and to recognize its primary role in the peacemaking process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council calls on all States to respect Afghanistan's sovereignty, territorial integrity, strictly refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, and respect the right of the Afghan people to determine their own destiny, and reaffirms its readiness to assist the Afghan people in their desire to achieve peace and tranquillity in their country."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-77.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/77</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
