	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">May I invite the General Assembly to direct its attention to section I of the report of the General Committee. In that section, the Committee took note of the information contained in paragraph 2.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">May I request the General Assembly to now direct its attention to section II, entitled "Organization of the session", which contains a number of recommendations concerning the General Committee, rationalization of work, the opening and closing dates for the session, the schedule of meetings, the general debate, the conduct of meetings, et cetera. All of those recommendations concern established practice.

	<p id="pg002-bk14-pa01"> With respect to paragraph 58, the General Committee recommended not to include item 165 of the draft agenda, entitled "Urging the Security Council to process Taiwan's membership application pursuant to rules 59 and 60 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council and Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations". I wish to recall for members that the General Committee adopted its recommendation without objection.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk14-pa02">In connection with this matter, I should like to inform members that there are already more than 50 speakers inscribed on my list. Before giving the floor to the first speaker, I wish to emphasize that if the General Assembly is to adhere to its programme of work, we must finish our consideration of the report of the General Committee today. I should like to remind members that we still have to consider the inclusion of other items, as well as section IV of the report, concerning the allocation of items.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk14-pa03">In addition, members are further reminded that the Assembly is not discussing the substance of this item. The subject of discussion before us now concerns only the recommendation of the General Committee not to include the item in the agenda of the sixty-second session. I would therefore strongly appeal to members to be as brief as possible in their statements on this subject.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jallow</span> <span class="nation">Gambia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">My delegation has always maintained consistency in lending support to the entry of Taiwan to the United Nations. Over the years, the results have always been like this: a sort of refusal, and in some cases, a refusal that is baseless, without any legal or procedural support, as we witnessed in the latest action, with all due respect to the General Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">For the friends of Taiwan, the reasons for our continuous support to the cause of Taiwan's membership are very clear and have been reiterated year after year. The fact that 52 speakers have thus far requested to make statements on this item signifies its importance to this international body.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">This year, unlike other years, the approach we used was to apply directly for membership; this was done by His Excellency the President of Taiwan. To the disappointment of the friends of Taiwan, the United Nations Secretariat unilaterally took the decision to return Taiwan's membership application, which constitutes an ultra vires action with regard to rule 59 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council. The Secretary-General has gone beyond his prerogative, to my mind, in accordance with the relevant sections of the Charter and the provisional rules of procedure I have just cited.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Taiwan is not part of China. That is an indisputable fact. The reasons for this have been advanced: Taiwan is a country of its own, it has its own Government, it runs its own economy and it is a highly industrialized country. At this stage, and over the past 50 years, the claimant to this island, the People's Republic of China, has never had any jurisdiction over Taiwan, and that is very clear. Taiwan has an independent Government and therefore is a sovereign State under article 4 of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">The Government of the Gambia feels Taiwan is qualified for membership. Taiwan runs an independent economy, being the eighteenth largest economy in the world. Unfortunately, because of the obstruction of one Member, which seems to hold very powerful influence in the Security Council, this matter is always thrown back at us.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">Taiwan is a country. It is a country that is under constant military threat. We are all aware of that threat. Relations across the Strait in the past years have remained strained because of China's persistent refusal to give up the use of military force against Taiwan. China has in fact deployed almost 1,000 tactical missiles, a number which increases annually by 100.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">Excluding Taiwan from the United Nations infringes upon the basic human rights of 23 million people, which is clearly a breach of article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Applying for United Nations membership under the name of Taiwan does not change the status quo. Resolution 2758 (XXVI), which was adopted in 1971, has been disputed because it did not respect the rules of procedure for elections and adopting resolutions. That resolution has been misinterpreted purely for convenience's sake. Nor did the resolution address the issue of representation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">In an article published by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research in July 2007 -- and I crave the indulgence of members for citing this to the Assembly -- John Bolton, who until recently was Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations, cogently argued that resolution 2758 (XXVI) is wholly illegitimate, by its own terms violating the Charter of the United Nations in multiple respects, and is a virtually dispositive rebuttal to the contention that the United Nations functions within the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">To conclude, for 14 years, this issue of Taiwan's entry into the United Nations has returned, year after year after year. It is apparent that it will not die a natural death, because those people are determined. To deny them their self-determination by rules that have been misinterpreted for convenience's sake would be to not give this Organization the respect it deserves.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">It is our view that Taiwan has been unjustifiably treated, especially when it took the legal procedures to apply for membership, which was illegally denied. On this note, excluding Taiwan from the United Nations infringes on the basic human rights, I repeat once more, of 23 million people, which is clearly a breach of article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa11">On that note, I urge this house to consider the issue of Taiwan more seriously than it has done in the past.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Malmierca Díaz</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">The Republic of Cuba reaffirms its full respect for the principle of one China and Taiwan as an inalienable part of Chinese territory. Any attempt by the Taiwanese authorities to join the United Nations is a flagrant violation of prior decisions of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">In its resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971, the General Assembly recognized the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of China at the United Nations. From early this year, the Taiwanese authorities have undertaken a new attempt to separate Taiwan from the rest of the territory of the People's Republic of China. More recently, on 23 July, the Secretariat announced that its Office of Legal Affairs had refused to receive a letter from the Taiwanese authorities requesting membership of the United Nations under the name of Taiwan. The Secretariat stated, with reason, that United Nations policy is governed by resolution 2758 (XXVI), which recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole representative of the Chinese people.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">The Republic of Cuba deems that fact to strengthen its unequivocal position that the issue of Taiwan should not be included in or discussed under the General Assembly's agenda. There are no legal aspects to justify the holding of a debate on an issue that is an internal Chinese affair. The rule of law should be respected by all States, and to that end we should start by respecting the principles reflected in the United Nations Charter, and resolutions and other decisions of the Organization's main organ.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">The Republic of Cuba insists on the need to respect the territorial integrity of States and not to intervene in their internal affairs. For Cuba, there is only one China, unitary and indivisible, and Taiwan is a part of its territory. We reject any attempt by the authorities of Taiwan to join this international Organization.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Guangya</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">I have a great deal to say on this subject. However, in response to your appeal, Sir, I will make only a few, brief remarks. I also hope that other speakers will also heed your appeal.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The Chinese delegation firmly opposes the inclusion of item 165 in the agenda of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session, and firmly supports the recommendation made by the General Committee in its report. The recommendation conforms to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 2758(XXVI), and reflects the common will of the overwhelming majority of Member States. I now wish to underscore the following three points.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">First, there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of China's territory. That is the common position of the United Nations and the overwhelming majority of its Member States. China is yet to be reunited, but the fact that both the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China has never been changed. That is an objective reality that nobody can deny.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971 long ago resolved once and for all China's representation in the United Nations politically, legally and in terms of procedure. The political and legal meanings of the resolution are integrated and clear-cut. The scope of China's territory has never changed since the founding of the United Nations. China's representation in the United Nations certainly includes Taiwan. It is futile for the Taiwanese authorities and a very few countries to deny historical facts, take things out of context and attempt to distort and even deny resolution 2758 (XXVI).</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization composed only of sovereign States. As a region of China, Taiwan is not entitled to United Nations membership under any name whatsoever. No sovereign State in the world, including the sponsors, would allow one of its regions to become a Member of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Secondly, compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have the same origin and ancestors and speak the same language. They share a common destiny and ride on the same boat. The 23 million Taiwanese compatriots are part of the 1.3-billion-strong Chinese people and Taiwan belongs to the entire Chinese people. No one cares more about the prospects and interests of Taiwan than the Chinese people. In consistent adherence to the fundamental principle of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems, the Chinese Government has always made every effort and worked with the utmost sincerity to deliver benefits to the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification. We sincerely hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits will render mutual respect, cooperate for mutual benefit, and work together for a beautiful future of peace, stability, development and prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">However, the Taiwanese authorities, with a view to seeking selfish political gains, have deliberately provoked cross-Straits confrontation, intensified their separatist activities for Taiwan independence, and frenziedly clamoured for the so-called issue of Taiwan's membership of the United Nations. Their purpose is to seek de jure Taiwanese independence. Such adventurous activities of the separatist forces for Taiwanese independence, if not curbed in time, will seriously undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, gravely affect cross-Straits relations and severely threaten peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. We will never tolerate Taiwanese independence or allow anyone to separate Taiwan from China in any form whatsoever.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Thirdly, respect for state sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs is one of the cardinal principles of the Charter of the United Nations. At the instigation of the Taiwanese authorities and in defiance of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 2758(XXVI), Gambia and a very few other countries have raised the so-called issue of Taiwan's participation in the United Nations at the General Assembly's sessions year after year. This seriously violates China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and gravely interferes in China's internal affairs. It is also a waste of the precious resources and time of the United Nations and a serious interruption of the normal work of the General Assembly. The Chinese Government and people strongly condemn and firmly oppose such an act.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">China has never done anything to harm the interests of the sponsors, but the sponsors have time and again trampled on internationally acknowledged truth and the one-China principle widely recognized by the international community. Some countries even started to take an active part in activities aimed at splitting China as soon as they obtained their United Nations membership. We strongly urge the sponsors to change their positions and comply with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 2758(XXVI). We urge them to cherish their international image and dignity, and refrain from seeking to serve transient interests while being used by the Taiwanese authorities for separatist activities aimed at Taiwanese independence.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">We believe that the overwhelming majority of Member States supports the Chinese Government in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the adoption of the General Committee's recommendation, and opposes the inclusion of the so-called Taiwan-related proposal into the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias Cárdenas</span> <span class="nation">Venezuela</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we would like to express our congratulations to you on your election as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its sixty-second session. We wish you every success in carrying out your high responsibilities before the Assembly. We would also like to express our congratulations to the other members of the General Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">With regard to the request to include on the agenda the item urging the Security Council to process Taiwan's application to become a State Member of the United Nations pursuant to rules 59 and 60 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council and Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela believes that, in accordance with the recommendation of the General Committee, this issue should not be included on the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole and legitimate representative of the Chinese Government and people. Insofar as Venezuela is concerned, there is only one China, and Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">In accordance with the respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and in view of the excellent and deep relationship of friendship, respect and cooperation between the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Government of the People's Republic of China, my delegation opposes including this item on the agenda of the sixty-second session.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sea</span> <span class="nation">Cambodia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, at the outset, allow me to convey, on behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia, our warmest congratulations to you on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly and to assure you of our fullest cooperation and support.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Cambodia firmly supports the decision taken by the General Committee on 19 September 2007 not to recommend the inclusion of the item on Taiwan's membership in the agenda for the sixty-second session of this body. It was only through your strong leadership, Mr. President, that the members of the General Committee were able to reach a consensus on this matter. The explicit manner in which you wisely guided the Committee's work on Wednesday is deeply appreciated.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">Cambodia considers that any attempt to create a so-called representation of Taiwan to the United Nations is a violation of the purposes and principles of its Charter, as well as of resolution 2758 (XXVI), in particular, adopted by the General Assembly in 1971 with an overwhelming majority of votes. That resolution clearly states that the representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only lawful representative of China to the United Nations. That resolution has solved, once and for all, the issue of China's representation at our Organization. Thus, there must not be any so-called Taiwan representation in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">It is a well-known fact that Taiwan is an integral part of the People's Republic of China, and no sovereign State in our world today would allow one of its parts to apply for membership at our humble world Organization. My Government wishes to reconfirm its full commitment to the one-China principle. We strongly condemn any dangerous move in any form or manifestation that undermines China's unity and integrity.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">The manoeuvre for Taiwan's membership in our Organization constitutes an act of provocation against China and may trigger an extremely tense and dangerous situation in the Taiwan Strait, thus posing a threat to peace, stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world as well.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">Hence, Cambodia fully supports the adoption of the first report of the General Committee at the meeting today. We support the clear-cut decision not to include the item of Taiwan's membership on the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

I am confident that the work of our session will be crowned with success, in view of your vast experience and wisdom. Furthermore, we would like to express our readiness to work with you in the performance of your important tasks in the best way possible.

	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa03">My delegation believes that resolution 2758 (XXVI), of 1971, is clear in its definition of the legitimate representation of that country at the United Nations. Colombia therefore supports the recommendation made by the General Committee not to include this item in the agenda of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Ferrari</span> <span class="nation">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">The General Committee's erroneous and undemocratic decision to flout the rules of procedure of the General Assembly -- in particular, rule 43 -- and to curtail the rights of Member States to put forward their points of view on an important issue and, moreover, to severely restrict those whom the Committee, in its wisdom, permitted to speak, has forced me to make another statement today in support of Taiwan's application for membership of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">For over 25 years, my Government has enjoyed a close and mutually rewarding relationship with the democratically elected Government of Taiwan. We are here today, as we have been so often in the past, to speak for our Taiwanese friends, who, as a result of intransigence by the States Members of the Organization, remain voiceless in this House. The request for the inclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly entitled "Urging the Security Council to process Taiwan's membership application pursuant to rules 59 and 60 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council and Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations" was, as we expected, rejected once again by the General Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">On 19 July 2007, an application for membership of the United Nations signed by the President of Taiwan was delivered to the Secretary-General. In Article 4, paragraph 1, the Charter of the United Nations provides that</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">"Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations".</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Article 4, paragraph 2, outlines the method by which the United Nations takes a decision on a membership application. Essentially, it states that the General Assembly will make a decision on the matter based upon the recommendation of the Security Council. Taiwan is a peace-loving State and unhesitatingly accepts the obligations contained in the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Instead of dealing with the application as he is mandated to do by the Charter, the Secretary-General, apparently upon the advice of the Office of Legal Affairs, returned the application as "unreceivable". In an accompanying letter, the Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs referred to General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) and stated, inter alia, that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg007-bk01-pa07">"In accordance with that resolution the United Nations considers Taiwan for all intents and purposes to be an integral part of the People's Republic of China".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">That response by the United Nations bureaucracy is a direct attack upon the Charter. My Government is extremely troubled at the notion that the United Nations Secretariat is now taking upon itself the role of arbiter of purely political decisions that are the purview of Member States. We believe that in this instance the Secretariat has crossed a fine dividing line, and that the Secretary-General has been poorly advised. It is our hope that, after listening to this and other statements in support of Taiwan's rights, and after careful reflection on the matter, the Secretary-General will be persuaded to do the right thing.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">There is no doubt in our minds that it is the States Members of the United Nations that have absolute authority to pronounce themselves on membership applications. Those of us who speak for Taiwan, who promote its right to be a Member of the United Nations and who stand up and defend that right are mostly small Member States. Nevertheless, we are determined, and we are sovereign countries with all the rights afforded to us by virtue of our membership of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">Allow me to spend just a little time discussing resolution 2758 (XXVI), its genesis, its provisions and its effects.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">Year after year, when we have the opportunity to raise the issue of Taiwan in the United Nations, we hear statements in which Member States constantly regurgitate that resolution and base their positions on its provisions. The resolution has been said to, among other things, first, advance the principle of one China, and secondly, make Taiwan, for all intents and purposes, an integral part of the People's Republic of China. I venture to submit that it does none of that. It is a truism in these halls that if you repeat something often enough and loudly enough it is taken to be the law. I often wonder whether those who hide behind the shield of that resolution and claim for it extraordinary powers have ever taken the time to read it.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">The resolution is very short, and it has been argued cogently that it is not legitimate because it violates the Charter of the United Nations in several respects and is fatally flawed. But that argument is for another time and another day. The resolution was passed in 1971, at the height of the cold war. It has only one operative paragraph, which reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa13">"Decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it." (<i>resolution 2758 (XXVI)</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa14">The resolution fails to cite any Charter provision, for the simple reason that it was clearly not based on the Charter. In fact, it violated several provisions and achieved membership of the United Nations for the People's Republic of China through the back door. The legitimate way, and the way in which Taiwan seeks to enter, is through the Security Council. But in 1971 that would have led to the exercise of the veto. The resolution purported to do three things: first, to expel a Member of the United Nations; secondly, to admit a new Member; and, thirdly, to replace a permanent member of the Security Council. Despite that, the membership at the time managed to convince itself that the resolution did not deal with an important question, and thus did not require a two-thirds majority, as required under Article 18 of the Charter. In fact, the resolution succeeded by a vote of 76 in favour to 35 against, with 17 abstentions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa15">The resolution does not declare that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China, does not preclude Taiwan from future membership and certainly does not support the so-called one-China principle. Furthermore, the factual and political situation that exists today is entirely different from that which prevailed 36 years ago. Taiwan is not seeking to represent China as the Government of Chiang Kai-shek did in 1971. The democratically elected Government of Taiwan in this day and age seeks to represent only Taiwan and its 23 million people. It is the firm position of my Government that Taiwan's application for membership is absolutely legitimate. Member States should examine the application fairly and dispassionately and decide upon its fate in the prescribed way. Any Member State with a conflict of interest in the debate should recuse itself from the deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa16">Are we in the Organization guilty of the trait of fiddling while Rome burns? For too long, it seems to my Government, the States Members of the Organization have been content to ignore the plight of the 23 million Taiwanese people, who are denied their basic rights because of the intransigence of one permanent member of the Security Council. The well-known culture of inaction at the United Nations has given way, in this instance, to a culture of expediency in which it is the policy of the majority of Member States to do not what is right, but what is least likely to cause a severe reaction on the part of a powerful Member State. I repeat: Taiwan has every right to be a Member of this Organization.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Egypt supports the General Committee's recommendation that the inclusion of an additional item, on membership for Taiwan, in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly be rejected, and we support the adoption of the Committee's report. The Committee's recommendation is in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 2758 (XXVI), and it reflects the will of the majority of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted in 1971, resolved once and for all China's representation in the United Nations, politically, legally and in terms of procedure. Since 1993, the General Committee has consistently rejected inclusion in the Assembly's agenda of the issue of Taiwanese membership in the United Nations. The repetition of that proposal and the repeated discussions on this issue are a waste of time and resources. Accordingly, the representatives of the People's Republic of China are the sole legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. As an integral part of China, Taiwan is not entitled to membership in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States is a cardinal principle enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The question of Taiwan is an internal affair in China; hence, it should be resolved by the Chinese people themselves.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Rwanda supports the General Committee's recommendation that Taiwan's request for admission not be included in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. My delegation reaffirms its support for the idea of one China, the People's Republic of China, in keeping with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and, in particular, as established by resolution 2758 (XXVI). Under that resolution, Taiwan is an integral part of a single China. The Republic of Rwanda abides by that resolution and thus supports the Committee's recommendation that the issue of Taiwan's request for admission not be included in the agenda of the sixty-second session.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">Once again, we are faced with a discussion on whether Taiwan should be accorded membership in the United Nations. The rules of the Organization state clearly that only sovereign States can become Members. Taiwan, however, is not a sovereign State. It is a region of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations. The debate on this issue was settled once and for all by resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa02">The delegation of Myanmar fully supports the statement made by the representative of the People's Republic of China, in which he clearly spelled out compelling reasons to reject the inclusion of the proposed item in the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa03">There is only one China, and it is represented by the People's Republic of China. Myanmar is a friendly neighbour of that country and adheres strictly to the one-China policy, which is also widely accepted by the international community. Furthermore, the Government of the Union of Myanmar regards Taiwan as an integral part of the People's Republic of China. There must be no interference in China's internal affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa04">We also wish to express our view that the attempt to include an item on Taiwan in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly is a flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. This issue was decisively settled in 1971 by resolution 2758 (XXVI). We therefore feel strongly that it has no place in the agenda of the sixty-second session, and we oppose its inclusion.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa01">The delegation of the Russian Federation supports the General Committee's recommendation that the item on Taiwan's so-called admittance as a Member of the United Nations not be included in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. We believe that that recommendation is rational, that it reflects the views of the absolute majority of Committee members and that it is based on compliance with international law, the principle of non-interference in States' internal affairs and respect for the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa02">The Russian Federation's position on the issue of Taiwan, which is based on principle, is well known. We believe that there is only one China and that the island of Taiwan is an integral part of it. The Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate Government of all of China. That position is enshrined in Russian domestic law and has been reaffirmed in various international commitments undertaken by our country, including the Treaty of Friendship, Good-Neighbourliness and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, signed on 16 July 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa03">As is known, the issue of China's representation in the United Nations was clearly resolved in 1971 by resolution 2758 (XXVI). Therefore, the Russian Federation has consistently opposed the island's admission into any international organization whose membership is limited to sovereign States.</p>

We support the adoption of the report. Timor-Leste reiterates that there is only one China in the world. The Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate Government representing the whole of China. Taiwan is an integral part of China's territory. As a region of China, Taiwan is not entitled to membership in the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk03-pa02">Maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States is one of the cardinal principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The Taiwan question is therefore an internal affair of China and should be resolved only by the Chinese people themselves. There is, therefore, no need to bring this issue to the General Assembly for discussion. Furthermore, the United Nations is an intergovernmental organization composed only of sovereign States. As a province of China, Taiwan is not entitled to membership in the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk03-pa03">There is only one China; that reality has not changed. Thus there is no need to continue to try to push Members to think otherwise when the reality is very clear. As the majority of Member States have spoken on this issue year after year, it is now high time that the issue be put to rest for good.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa02">The delegation of the Republic of Tajikistan is deeply sympathetic to the arguments on this issue put forward by the representative of China and fully shares them. The fundamental position of Tajikistan is in support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China and its international legal status, which are enshrined the United Nations Charter and in bilateral agreements. Our position continues to be unchanged, and that is that there is one single China in the world and that the Government of the People's Republic is the sole legitimate Government, representing all of China, and that Taiwan is an integral part of China. That is widely recognized also by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa03">As already stated, the issue of the representation of China in the United Nations was fully addressed in Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI), of 25 October 1971, which qualifies the People's Republic as the only lawful representative of China in the United Nations. In view of that, the Republic of Tajikistan is against the proposal to include that issue in the agenda of the sixty-second session. We support the decision of the General Committee not to recommend its inclusion.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mehdiyev</span> <span class="nation">Azerbaijan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa01">Azerbaijan deeply respects and follows, as a pillar of its foreign policy, the principles and norms of international law, especially the principles of sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States. Azerbaijan strongly condemns separatism and rejects any attempts to undermine States' territorial integrity. Azerbaijan has always supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China and proceeds from the fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of it.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa02">In 1971 the General Assembly, at its twenty-sixth session, adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI), which clearly indicated that the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations. That resolution settled the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. We believe that the question of Taiwan is an internal matter of China. Azerbaijan supports China's commitment to peaceful reunification. We express our hope that this issue will be settled through negotiations between the parties concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa03">In the light of all that, my delegation opposes the inclusion in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the item called "Urging the Security Council to process Taiwan's membership application pursuant to rules 59 and 60 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council and Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations".</p>

	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, a voice with authority higher than mine will at the right time express the sincere congratulations of the delegation of Gabon on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the Assembly at this session.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States and non-interference in their internal affairs are among the cardinal principles consecrated in the Charter of the United Nations. Thus the question of China, being an internal matter for Taiwan, should be left to the discretion of the Chinese people. Resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted in 1971, once and for all resolved the issue of the representation of China in the United Nations, in terms of both legality and procedure. According to that resolution, the representatives of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China at the United Nations. That resolution is the legal basis and political principle that guide the United Nations and the specialized agencies in dealing with the question of Taiwan.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The recommendation of the General Committee to the General Assembly is thus in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter and with resolution 2758 (XXVI). It reflects the will of almost the totality of United Nations Members. We support that recommendation of the Committee, which has rejected the inclusion of the issue of the so-called independence of Taiwan in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly, and we support the adoption of the Committee's report. The overwhelming majority of Member States has refused to discuss the issue of Taiwan in the Assembly plenary in order to devote more effort to the debate on more important issues that bring us together here by tradition.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">Since 1993, successive General Committees of the General Assembly have unequivocally rejected the participation of Taiwan in the United Nations. A small number of States, however, continue to raise the same issue year after year in order to discuss a topic concerning which no controversy exists. That represents not only an affront to the sovereignty of a Member State and a flagrant intervention in its internal affairs, but also a waste of time at a moment when we are all called to devote ourselves to the great challenges of the day, such as climate change, development and even the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">As we know, the United Nations is an organization composed only of sovereign States. The principle of universality is based on sovereign States and is applicable only to them. As a province of China, Taiwan cannot hope to become a Member of the United Nations. No sovereign State in the world, including those that today support the discussion of the Taiwan issue, can allow its provinces or regions to become Members of the United Nations. The rules of procedure of the General Assembly and the Security Council are invoked by certain States to raise the issue of Taiwan, but they are taken out of context and do not apply to the issue at hand in any way. The United Nations must not become a place where the partition of Member States is encouraged. The subject of Taiwan therefore has no place on the agenda of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">In that framework, I should like to reiterate in the strongest terms my country's steadfast support for the one-China policy. We consider that the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate representative of all China; that the issue under discussion was definitively resolved by resolution 2758 (XXVI); and that, as stipulated in the said resolution, the People's Republic of China is the only lawful Government and the only legitimate representative of the entire territory of China to the United Nations.</p>

In the meantime, allow me to express our pleasure at seeing you preside over our deliberations and to assure you of our full cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">The General Assembly is meeting once again to discuss a question that, for my Government, should have been laid to rest when, in resolution 2758 (XXVI), the General Assembly decided to restore to the People's Republic of China all its rights and the recognition of the representatives of its Government as the sole legitimate representatives of that country to the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">Today more than ever, the legitimacy of representation of the People's Republic of China in its entirety should be in no doubt. From that perspective, my country deems the recommendations of the General Committee to be in accordance with the will of the majority of States Members of the United Nations. My country, the Republic of Guinea, faithful in particular to the principles of the United Nations and to friendship and cooperation, firmly condemns any attempt to recognize Taiwan and unequivocally reaffirms the principle of one China: the People's Republic of China. We aver that Taiwan is and always has been an integral part of the People's Republic of China.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">We welcome the efforts made by the People's Republic of China to defend the ideals of peace, justice, security and development. Guinea, as the first sub-Saharan African country to establish diplomatic relations with that friendly country, will continue to strengthen its ties to the benefit of our respective peoples and of the international community. In view of all this, my delegation firmly opposes including the question of the representative of Taiwan to the United Nations in the agenda of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk03-pa02">We fully endorse and firmly support the recommendation of the General Committee not to include item 165 on the agenda of the sixty-second session. The effort to include the item on the General Assembly's agenda is confrontational and destructive. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States and non-interference in their internal affairs are fundamental principles of the United Nations and enshrined in its Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk03-pa03">In recent years, unfortunately, there has been a trend to step up attempts to violate those principles. The delegation of Belarus calls for unswerving adherence to the norms set forth in the United Nations Charter. My delegation has always supported strengthening the role of the General Assembly, including through enhanced importance for its agenda. We believe that attempts to include unwarranted issues on the Assembly's agenda, including item 165, divert the attention and resources of Member States from consideration of truly pressing issues on the international agenda that require debate and decisions.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa02">In line with its respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, which have been shared by the Argentine Republic and the People's Republic of China since the normalization of diplomatic relations in 1972, Argentina opposes any attempt on the part of Taiwan -- a territory that is part of the People's Republic of China -- to join any international body. We believe that the United Nations should not become a place to endorse the separation of a part of the territory of one of its sovereign Member States. Territorial integrity is a principle of international law from which flows the inalienable right and duty of a State to preserve its borders. In that connection, our country supports the one-China policy adopted by the United Nations in 1971.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">As the General Assembly begins its second formal meeting of the sixty-second session, I wish to assure you, Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of Sri Lanka, of our full cooperation and commitment in the deliberations of this session. We express our full confidence in your able stewardship.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">My delegation firmly supports the statement delivered by the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China with regard to the recommendation of the General Committee not to include in the agenda an item on Taiwan's application for membership in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Sri Lanka's position on the issue of Taiwan is clear and has been consistent over the years. Sri Lanka strongly believes that there is only one China and that the People's Republic of China represents the aspirations of all the people of China. It is the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations and to all other organizations related to it.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">Sri Lanka is of the view that resolution 2758 (XXVI), of 1971, clearly resolved the question of China's representation in the United Nations. Since then, the policy of one China has received the clear support of the overwhelming majority of Member States, thereby recognizing Taiwan as an integral part of the People's Republic of China. We therefore steadfastly support the position of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan, being an integral part of the People's Republic of China, does not have the sovereign right to apply for membership of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">We are not convinced that there is any solid basis or reason to reopen this same debate every year, given that the results have been obvious. Moreover, this proposal attempts to violate the territorial integrity and sovereignty of a State Member of the United Nations. The issue of Taiwan is clearly an internal affair of the People's Republic of China. We are strongly opposed to any move that interferes with an internal affair of a Member State, blatantly challenging the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">It is in that context that Sri Lanka strongly supports the recommendation of the General Committee not to include the proposed supplementary item on Taiwan's application for membership of the United Nations in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

In that connection, my delegation believes that neither Taiwan's attempt nor the inclusion in the agenda of an item in that regard are compatible with the decisions of the United Nations. We therefore reaffirm our support for resolution 2758 (XXVI).</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">Mexico believes that there is no justification whatever to question the validity of the resolution adopted on 25 October 1971. The delegation of Mexico therefore firmly rejects the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa01">As this is the first time that my delegation is taking the floor during this session, allow me, on behalf of the delegation of Morocco, to convey to you, Sir, our heartfelt congratulations on your election to preside over the General Assembly. We are certain that, given your personal qualities, your professional skills and your belief in promoting multilateralism, you will be able to successfully carry out the honourable and difficult mandate that has been given to you. You have can rely on my delegation's full willingness to work with you to ensure the complete success of our work at this session.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa02">My delegation supports the recommendation of the General Committee not to include an agenda item on Taiwan's application for membership of the United Nations in the agenda of the sixty-second session. As we have always maintained, we continue to believe that the issue of China's representation at the United Nations was fully resolved in resolution 2758 (XXVI). By that resolution, the General Assembly definitively decided this issue in its political, legal and procedural contexts by affirming that the People's Republic of China was the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people at the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa03">Therefore, in the absence of any new elements that could warrant the reconsideration of this matter, the delegation of Morocco would once again like to say that it opposes the inclusion of this item on the agenda of this session. The position of the Kingdom of Morocco on this issue reflects its steadfast commitment to full respect for the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Our position also once again attests to our resolute commitment to the principles of respect for the territorial integrity of States and the value of dialogue to bring about a peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Beck</span> <span class="nation">Palau</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">We would like to convey our warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">On Wednesday, the General Committee decided, after a vote, that the majority of Member States that had requested the inclusion of this supplementary agenda item would not be permitted to speak, despite the applicability of rule 43, which we believe guarantees their participation. Although there was a vote to limit debate, that vote contravened the rule. When democracy and the rule of law collide, the rule of law must prevail. That is the way we protect all countries regardless of their size or population.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">In formulating the procedures for membership applications and their consideration, a delicate system of checks and balances has been put into place. In that system, the Secretary-General, the Security Council and the General Assembly each play a well-defined role. The Secretary-General is to receive the membership application, transmit it to the Security Council for consideration and circulate it to the members of the General Assembly. The Security Council then makes recommendations on the membership application. The General Assembly makes the final determination. In this case, the actions of the Secretariat have subverted that process.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">On 19 July, Taiwan submitted its application for membership to the Secretary-General. The next day, the Secretary-General's Legal Counsel returned it as "unreceivable", citing resolution 2758 (XXVI). My Government considers that to be a violation of the rule of law. The Charter and the rules define the path for new membership applications. The Secretary-General's role is a ministerial one, and he has no discretion to consider or evaluate applications. The United Nations has always followed that path -- until now, in the case of Taiwan's membership application.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Article 4 of the Charter states that membership is open to all peace-loving States able and willing to accept and carry out the obligations set forth in the Charter, and that decisions regarding membership are to be made by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. The Charter and rules 58 and 59 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council state that applications for membership are to be submitted to the Secretary-General, who "shall immediately place the application for membership before the representatives on the Security Council" (<i>provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council</i>, rule 59).</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">There is no way to read those mandates as giving the Secretary-General the power to block the transmission of an application to the Security Council and ultimately to the General Assembly. It is not up to the Secretary-General to interpret resolutions and precedents, but that has been the case here, where the legal staff of the Secretary-General has interposed resolution 2758 (XXVI) as a pretext to block Taiwan's application, in violation of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">We concede that there are many competing views about the meaning and the relevance to this situation of resolution 2758 (XXVI), but that is not what is at issue before the Assembly today. Whatever one may think about the interpretation and the relevance of resolution 2758 (XXVI), it is crystal clear that those determinations are reserved for Member States through the Security Council and the General Assembly. This is why every Secretary-General in history has transmitted the membership applications presented to him, even when the political climate made it unlikely that the applicant would succeed, and even when prior rejections of the application, as in the case of South Korea, Nepal, Viet Nam and Israel, to mention a few, could have been interposed by the Secretary-General to block subsequent membership applications on the ground that prior actions of the United Nations had made the applications unreceivable.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">If we do not uphold the rule of law here, who will? If we do not uphold the rule of law here, who are we to criticize others for failing to do so? That is why we, along with 15 other Member States, have asked the General Assembly to address this matter. That is also why we ask you, Mr. President, to reconvene the General Committee for a full debate on this matter, in compliance with the applicable rules.</p>

The validity of General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI), whereby the issue of China's representation in the United Nations was solved from the political, legal and procedural points of view, should be respected. Greece has always supported the principles of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China.</p>

	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa02">To be brief, my Government wishes to reiterate its position recognizing only one China and considering that the question of its representation in the United Nations was settled once and for all in General Assembly 2758 (XXVI). That is why my delegation gives its full support to the report of the General Committee (<a href="../pdf/A-62-250.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/250</a>) and to its recommendation contained in paragraph 58.</p>

Malaysia supports the recommendation of the General Committee on this issue and, given the heavy responsibilities and tight schedule of the General Assembly, we feel that there is no need to discuss this proposal in plenary meeting. Malaysia subscribes to a one-China policy and believes that the sole legitimate Government representing China is the People's Republic of China and that Taiwan is an integral part of China. The Taiwan question is therefore internal to China and it to be resolved by the Chinese people themselves.</p>

	<p id="pg015-bk05-pa03">Resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted at the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly, in 1971, resolved the issue of China's representation in the United Nations politically, legally and in terms of procedure. According to that resolution, the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. Maintaining the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Member States and non-interference in their internal affairs are basic principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The Republic of Serbia is of the view that there is only one China and that the question of Taiwan should be resolved by the Chinese people themselves. Therefore, there is no reason to submit the issue to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>

The Central African Republic reaffirms once again its support for the principle of one China, with Taiwan as an integral part of the People's Republic of China.

	<p id="pg015-bk07-pa02">In the light of the foregoing, Trinidad and Tobago does not support the inclusion in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly of item 165 of the draft agenda, entitled "Urging the Security Council to process Taiwan's membership application pursuant to rules 59 and 60 of the provisional rules of the procedure of the Security Council and Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations".

We continue to support that resolution because it is closely tied to the subject that we are considering. My country believes that China is the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people, and we again support the unity and territorial integrity of China and its Government and people.

	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">On behalf of my country's delegation, I would like to confirm our position as declared here last year. It is a position that Yemen adopted some time ago, in support of resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted at the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly in 1971. That resolution resolved the issue of China's representation at the United Nations. Since 1993, the General Committee has refused to discuss the issue in view of the fact that the issue of Taiwan is an internal Chinese affair, which should be solved by the Chinese people, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">We once again confirm our country's position and our support for the one-China policy.

As you are an accomplished diplomat who is concerned about peace and justice and a citizen of a State that emerged from the former Yugoslavia, there can be no doubt that you fully appreciate the principle of the equality of the rights of peoples and of their right to decide their own fate as set forth in our Charter. We therefore continue to believe that, under your tenure, the matter of Taiwan has developed positively.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">Since the re-establishment of diplomatic relations, my country has spared no effort in supporting Taiwan in its legitimate quest to return to international decision-making forums with the sole aim of contributing to the formulation and implementation of global policies, like all other States throughout the world. Unfortunately, this year once again, Taiwan has seen its observer status rejected both in the World Health Organization and in the World Organization for Animal Health.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">Before considering this issue, we should take the trouble to ask ourselves whether the United Nations, in its role as the head of international governance, can do without Taiwan. Our responsibility is great, and I am not unaware of the strong pressure exerted on certain delegations because of the sensitivity of the issue. But we must not look the other way, because 23 million Taiwanese are calling upon us to do our duty to assist peoples in fully achieving self-determination.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">In endorsing the arguments and explanations made by the representatives of the Gambia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Palau, my country, Burkina Faso, wishes to solemnly reaffirm here that Taiwan is a free, independent, sovereign and peaceful State with a democratically elected Government, which is the only legitimate guarantor of the interests of the 23 million citizens of Taiwan. Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with many countries -- including my own -- that are United Nations Members, and it plays an important role in several international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization, the Asian Development Bank and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. It is thus an active and indisputable partner of the international community. What more do we need as proof to recognize this country's right to sit with us in the United Nations?</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">It is high time that this ostrich policy -- which consists of believing that problems can be resolved by sticking our heads in the sand -- come to an end. My delegation reaffirms its tireless support for the cause of Taiwan and calls once more on the international community to take the important and urgent decision to include the issue of Taiwan in the agenda of the present session.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk05-pa02">In the General Committee, Uruguay voted in favour of adopting the provisional agenda of the sixty-second session and, in that connection, the non-inclusion of the issue of Taiwan in the agenda of the General Assembly. Our delegation believes that there are legal norms that fully justify that decision, such as resolution 2758 (XXVI), and principles guaranteeing the territorial integrity of States.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk05-pa03">The Government of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay maintains diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, recognizes the one-China principle and considers that the solution recommended by the General Committee expresses the will of the vast majority of States Members of the Organization.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk06-pa01">I would like to express our full support for the position of the Government of the People's Republic of China. Moldova resolutely adheres to the one-China policy. Therefore, our delegation supports the decision of the General Committee not to recommend the inclusion of item 165 of the draft agenda in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Beck</span> <span class="nation">Solomon Islands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa01">Once again, we would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa02">My delegation wishes to register its regret and disappointment concerning the manner in which the proceedings of the General Committee were conducted on Wednesday 19 September on the question of Taiwan's application to United Nations membership.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa03">Unfortunately, non-compliance by both the Secretariat and the Security Council spilled over into the General Committee meeting. The General Assembly's rules of procedures were not observed. Rule 23, by which the inclusion of an item requires a debate by the sponsors, was not respected. Under rule 43 on the participation of members requesting the inclusion of items on the agenda, members were not allowed to speak, except for two representatives.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa04">Those rules exist because they define the nature and accepted processes of the United Nations. They protect and safeguard the principles and purpose of the Charter. What we witnessed was not only a frightening, but a dangerous process that defined democracy narrowly and did away with the participatory process of the membership. The process voted on by the General Committee excluded the participation of the sponsors, apart from the two I have just referred to.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa05">The two-by-two process only began in 2005 for time-factor reasons regarding the conclusion of the Millennium Summit Document. One has only to look at the 2005 verbatim record to note that. Tradition has always included a debate process at the General Committee level. Hence, we are now in this situation. The President's role, in my delegation's view, was to reach out to the wider membership and not to create a divide and marginalize members from the process.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa06">The issue, as we see it, is that we should not make up new rules as we go along, shutting and closing doors on selected members. It is hypocritical of this noble institution to advocate the rule of law internationally, yet not to observe its own house rules. We have continuously called for a just and fair trading system, yet practice double standards and selectivity on issues that count before this Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa07">There has been a constant refusal to listen to the other side of the story for more than decade. Hence, the issue is continuously swept under the carpet without question. My delegation wishes to ask this Assembly to first subject the matter to a debate and to discuss the legality of the 36-year old, cold-war resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971. It is based on the Cairo Declaration of 1943. That Declaration, from my delegation's perspective, contravenes the principle of self-determination. In other words, there is more to this issue than meets the eye.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa08">We need to do justice to the 23 million people of Taiwan, who have been independent for the past half-century and who are members, as other colleagues have said before me, of the World Trade Organization and the Asian Development Bank, amongst others.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa09">Solomon Islands also wishes to take this opportunity to condemn in the strongest possible terms the misguided legal advice both from Member States in positions of authority and from those in the Secretariat who shake and threaten the credibility of this Organization. No country should drive its own agenda by compromising the principles of the Charter, suffocating the application and paralysing the impartiality of our international civil service. Let us, in the name of peace, examine the item objectively and put it on the General Assembly's agenda to ensure that peace along the Strait is maintained through a United Nations process. It should be removed only through debate on any potential conflict, including an arms race in the East Asia region.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk07-pa10">Solomon Islands feels that the rule of law must be our guiding principle, and we would like once again to reiterate our call and associate ourselves with what my colleague from Palau said about referring the matter back to the General Committee, with proper adherence to the rules of procedure and allowing for some debate on the subject. At the moment, we are not allowed to speak in substance; hence, this proposal.</p>

	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">The people and the Government of Bolivia deeply regret the fact that this same scene has played out year after year. It is a marathon of repetitive speeches on an issue that was resolved on the basis of historic facts a long time ago. Perhaps, looking to the future, we should devise a mechanism to abbreviate these very lengthy speechmaking sessions.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">The Government of Bolivia practices and defends the diplomacy of peoples -- the diplomacy of dialogue, joint action and peaceful coexistence. Bolivia rejects any type of interference and pressure in the sovereign decision-making of countries. Bolivia therefore supports the decision taken Wednesday in the General Committee. We believe that the problem was fully solved many years ago. We believe that Taiwan is an integral part of the Chinese people.</p>

Cameroon will have the opportunity to reiterate its congratulations and support in a more solemn fashion at a later date.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">My delegation supports the statement made by the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China. We believe that there is only one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of it. Resolution 2758 (XXVI) definitively resolved the issue of the representation of China at the United Nations in political, legal and procedural terms. The Cameroon delegation therefore supports the recommendation of the General Committee and opposes the inclusion of item 165 of the draft agenda on the agenda of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.</p>

I also extend my felicitations to your able and professional secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">Regarding the request made by a few Member States, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-200.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/200</a>, to include a supplementary item entitled "Urging the Security Council to process Taiwan's membership application pursuant to rules 59 and 60 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council and Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations" on the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly, my delegation finds it to be a null-and-void proposal that has already been rejected by the General Committee. Such a request is totally inconsistent with General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI), of 1971. That resolution explicitly prescribes that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only lawful and legitimate representative of China at the United Nations. In deed and in practice, the resolution settled the issue of China's representation at the United Nations more than three decades ago.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">It is for that very reason that the request is considered to be intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of China, and to undermine a basic principle of international law, in general, and the Charter of the United Nations, in particular: that of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">My delegation, in association with the overwhelming majority of other Member States, rejects the proposal. We underline that the proposed item should not be included in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. The Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that the credibility and integrity of the Organization should be preserved by respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all Member States. To that end, Iran will not hesitate to shoulder its shared responsibility.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">Kazakhstan fully supports the Government of the People's Republic of China in safeguarding its State sovereignty and territorial integrity. My delegation supports the decision of the General Committee not to include an item on the application of Taiwan in the agenda of the current session. We proceed from the clear understanding that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate Government representing the people of China, and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">Resolution 2758 (XXVI), which was adopted by an overwhelming majority, stipulated that the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. Our delegation would like to reiterate once again that, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the question of Taiwan is an internal affair of China, which can be settled by the Chinese Government and the Chinese people themselves.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa02">My delegation believes that by adopting resolution 2758 (XXVI) the General Assembly pronounced itself definitively on the issue of China's representation at the United Nations.

	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">The Government of Paraguay expressed its traditional position on the issue before us in a letter dated 4 September 2007 addressed to the Secretary-General in accordance with established procedure. That letter reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa03">"In keeping with the principle of universality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and the attributes of statehood, as well as other essential circumstances, Paraguay believes that the international community cannot avoid consideration of the aforementioned proposal, which reflects the aspirations of the 23 million people of Taiwan, just as it would do for any other State that met the requirements established in the Charter of the United Nations. Consistent with this policy, Paraguay supported the admission of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) to the World Trade Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa04">"In that regard, my Government wishes to request, pursuant to rule 14 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the inclusion in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the above-mentioned supplementary item."

We recognize that there is only one China in the world. The Government of the People's Republic of China is the legitimate Government representing all China, and Taiwan is an integral part of China. We oppose any attempt to create two Chinas, or one China and one Taiwan. We also oppose Taiwan's independence and its participation in any international or regional organization whose members can only be sovereign States. We also reaffirm that we will not establish official relations with Taiwan or maintain official contacts with it in any form.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa02">There is only one China -- the People's Republic of China -- and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. It has been emphasized time and again that the question of China's representation in the United Nations has been resolved since 1971, when the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth session adopted by an overwhelming majority resolution 2758 (XXVI), which determined once and for all that the representatives of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations. In view of this fact, my delegation urges the General Assembly to once again reject firmly any attempts to put this matter on its agenda.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa02">The State of Kuwait believes that the issue of Taiwan's application for membership in the United Nations is a matter that was already dealt with by resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted at the twenty-sixth session. That resolution stipulates that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole lawful representative of the Chinese people. Any effort to include this item on the agenda of the General Assembly is a clear attempt to undermine that resolution. This attempt also undermines China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and constitutes interference in its internal affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa03">The State of Kuwait believes that there is one single China, one Chinese people and one Chinese Government that sits in Beijing. My delegation also believes that there is no justification for the inclusion of this item on the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">On the particular item under question, my delegation fully supports the recommendation of the General Committee not to include it in the agenda. The Committee's recommendation reflects the will of the majority of the States Members of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa03">Nepal further reiterates its consistent support of the one-China policy and upholds the spirit of resolution 2758 (XXVI). We also fully support the statement made by the delegation of China that Taiwan is an integral part of China and that the People's Republic of China is the sole and legitimate representative of the Chinese people in its territories, including Taiwan. Any debate on this issue is in violation of the principles of the international law. We therefore strongly urge this body not to include item 165 of the draft agenda in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

Peru adheres to the principle of one China, whose only representative is the People's Republic of China, with which Peru has cordial diplomatic relations. We support the ongoing implementation in the United Nations of resolution 2758 (XXVI), which in 1971 recognized that status for the People's Republic. As a result, we also support the recommendation of the General Committee that this item not be included on our agenda.</p>

We assure you of our full support and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa02">The delegation of Burundi would like to state here that Taiwan has been part of China's territory since time immemorial. Our delegation recognizes only a single, indivisible China. As China is indivisible, Taiwan is therefore an integral part of China. In resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971, the General Assembly decided to recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of China to the United Nations. That was the official position of the United Nations, and it has not changed since 1971.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa03">Keeping in mind that on 19 September 2007 the General Committee for the sixty-second session indicated by 24 votes to 3 that item 165 of the draft agenda would not be included in the agenda of the session, and believing that nothing is more eloquent than this supplementary verdict, we must therefore follow the democratic path. Can we reopen Pandora's box and jeopardize the territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations? That would run counter to the Charter, and we firmly believe that that would not help anyone. For our delegation, the issue has been fully resolved. There is only one China, the People's Republic of China, and we firmly oppose the inclusion of item 165 on the agenda for the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

My delegation reaffirms that the Democratic Republic of the Congo recognizes the People's Republic of China, with its capital in Beijing, as the sole legal and legitimate authority over all of China, including Taiwan, which is an integral part of Chinese territory.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">The Democratic Republic of the Congo commends the Beijing authorities for all their efforts to reunify their national territory in accordance with the modalities they themselves will determine, without any interference in the internal affairs of their country. For the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the adoption of resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971, the General Assembly definitively restored the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China.</p>

	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">On 25 October 1971, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI), by which it decided to admit the People's Republic of China to the United Nations. The question before us is to determine whether the political and legal reasons behind the adoption of the resolution remain valid. My delegation feels that that is indeed the case, and Côte d'Ivoire therefore supports the decision of the General Committee not to recommend the inclusion of Taiwan's membership application on the agenda.

	<p id="pg023-bk05-pa02">Chile, the first country of South America to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, hopes that, in the near future, all the territory of that great, friendly Power -- including the island territory -- will be integrated under one single authority as the result of a peaceful process.

	<blockquote id="pg023-bk06-pa03">"to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg023-bk06-pa04">Consequently, Indonesia has always maintained and honoured the one-China policy of the General Assembly, and we continue to recognize that the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate and sovereign representative of China at the United Nations.

Let me assure you of my delegation's full support and cooperation during your tenure of office.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">The recommendation of the General Committee conforms to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 2758 (XXVI), and reflects the will of the overwhelming majority of the Member States. In that regard, the Kingdom of Tonga supports the General Committee's recommendation to refuse to include the Taiwan-related proposal in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. It also supports the adoption of the General Committee's report.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa03">Maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States, and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States, are among the cardinal principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The Kingdom of Tonga continues to observe the one-China policy that recognizes Taiwan as an integral part of the People's Republic of China. We wish to reiterate that a crucial element of that policy properly acknowledges that common and mutual issues are left to the across-the-Strait dialogue framework, as opposed to its discussion at any multilateral forum.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Antonio</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">As this is the first time that the delegation of Angola has taken the floor during your presidency, Sir, we too would like to congratulate you on your election and to assure you of our full cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">Territorial integrity is a sacrosanct principle for Angola. At this point in the debate, we wish simply to join others who have spoken before us in support of the People's Republic of China and the principle of one indivisible China.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">Also like other delegations, we believe that this matter was properly and fully resolved with the adoption of resolution 2758 (XXVI). Given that fact, numerous delegations have for many years condemned the regrettable attempt to divide China. The General Committee has also for many years made the same recommendation as the one before us today. It is therefore high time to draw the appropriate lessons and conclude this matter once and for all.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">We therefore fully support the recommendation of the General Committee not to include an item on Taiwan's application for membership in the agenda for this session.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Coye-Felson</span> <span class="nation">Belize</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa01">Belize unreservedly supports Taiwan's application for membership of the United Nations. As we have heard, the issue before us is essentially a question of the rule of law. It is a question of the rule of law from two separate angles. It is a question of the rule of law in terms of procedure, wherein a valid issue of compliance with the Charter has been invoked as a result of the Secretary-General's dismissal of the application of Taiwan for United Nations membership. It is a question of the rule of law in terms of the application of the principle of universality embodied in the United Nations, wherein membership is based on a State's acceptance of the obligations contained in the Charter and is decided upon by the Organization. Our opponents avoid those questions by referring to resolution 2758 (XXVI), a resolution which did not, and does not now, enjoy consensus and which itself subverted the rules of procedure. Resolution 2758 (XXVI) is not the answer. It may be more aptly described as a perversion of the rule of law. The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines eloquently argued that point.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa02">The rule of law, supported by historical precedent, would unequivocally dictate that Taiwan's application for membership of the United Nations should be forwarded to the Security Council in accordance with the Charter, and that the declaration of the democratically elected representatives of the 23 million people of Taiwan that they would be bound by the obligations of the Charter be deemed to satisfy the conditions for membership in the United Nations. In that regard, we would support the proposal that Palau has made to reconvene the General Committee to consider this question once again.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khammanichanh</span> <span class="nation">Laos</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">At the outset, Sir, let me join previous speakers in conveying our heartfelt congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its the sixty-second session. We trust that your wisdom and great competence will lead our work to a successful conclusion. Our delegation assures you of our full support and cooperation in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to you.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa02">The delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms its position that there is only one China in the world. The Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate Government representing the whole of China. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. Resolution 2758 (XXVI), which was adopted in 1971, once and for all resolved China's representation at the United Nations -- politically, legally and in terms of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa03">The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic is resolved to support the one-China policy and efforts to bring about the peaceful national reunification of the People's Republic of China, which would ensure peace and prosperity for the Chinese people and contribute to the peace and stability of the region and the world.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa04">Given those reasons, the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic supports the recommendation of the General Committee not to include the issue of Taiwan's representation in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aisi</span> <span class="nation">Papua New Guinea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">My delegation congratulates you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We pledge our support to you.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">The Government of Papua New Guinea strongly reaffirms its one-China policy. The People's Republic of China is the sole representative of all the peoples of China at the United Nations. Papua New Guinea therefore supports the adoption of the report (<a href="../pdf/A-62-250.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/250</a>) of the General Committee as presented to the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pita</span> <span class="nation">Tuvalu</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa01">Allow me first to join previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. My delegation of course extends its full support and cooperation to you during your tenure of office. Let me also thank the members of the General Committee and the Secretariat for their hard work in preparing the Committee's first report (<a href="../pdf/A-62-250.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/250</a>), which the General Assembly is now considering.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa02">Despite the good work done by the General Committee, my delegation is sad to note with great dissatisfaction the decision taken by the Committee not to include item 165 of the draft agenda in the agenda of the General Assembly for this session. As a member of the United Nations with sovereign rights, Tuvalu would like to fully associate itself with the statements delivered by the Permanent Representative of Gambia, among others, supporting the need for such an item to be included in the General Assembly's agenda for this session.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa03">Let me reaffirm my Government's strong support for Taiwan's application for membership of the United Nations. We feel that this issue is long overdue and that it should be considered more seriously, and purely on its own merits.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa04">As a peace-loving nation, Tuvalu firmly believes that the paramount mission of the United Nations must remain the maintenance of peace and security for all nations of the world, as clearly articulated in the preamble to the Charter. In that context, it is our strong opinion that -- as Taiwan is a country with a well and clearly defined territory and an established democratic system of Government and a responsible international player in world trade and international relations -- the right of self-determination of Taiwan's 23 million people to join the United Nations should be urgently addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa05">The United Nations cannot be said to be universal, nor can global peace be assured, until Taiwan's membership application is properly resolved. Above all, Taiwan has all the capabilities to fulfil its obligations as a peace-loving State to become a full Member of the United Nations, as required under the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa06">Despite all that, it is sad to note that the United Nations has turned a blind eye to the wishes and the needs of the 23 million people of Taiwan, who simply want to be part of, and to participate in and contribute actively to, the attainment of the noble United Nations pillars of development, security and human rights. More sadly yet, the action taken by the Secretary-General in not complying with the requirements of the Charter of the United Nations and the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council is disappointing.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa07">Therefore, my delegation strongly opposes the General Committee's recommendation that Taiwan's membership application not be included in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Onischenko</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">Ukraine associates itself with those delegations that are opposed to the request of a group of Member States to include in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly a supplementary item relating to representation of Taiwan in the United Nations. We are confident that the question of China's representation in the United Nations was resolved by resolution 2758 (XXVI) and is therefore not a matter to be considered further.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kpukumu</span> <span class="nation">Sierra Leone</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">Allow me to join other delegations in congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session and to express my delegation's support and fullest cooperation in the fulfilment of your responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">Another year has gone by, and the well-known position of my delegation on the question of representation for Taiwan in the United Nations remains unchanged. Sierra Leone has remained consistent in its objection to representation for Taiwan, on the basis of its belief that Taiwan has been an inseparable part of China since ancient times and in the basis of my Government's commitment to the observance of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">Our position is consistent with resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971, adopted at the twenty-sixth session of the Assembly, which reaffirmed China's sovereignty over Taiwan. We therefore support adoption of the General Committee's recommendation that the proposed Taiwan-related item be excluded from the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">In recognition of the one-China principle, my delegation hopes for the realization of the complete reunification of Taiwan and China, in the interests of the Chinese people. The Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate Government representing the whole of China. We believe that resolution 2758 (XXVI) has been and will always be the legal basis for the one-China policy.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aboud</span> <span class="nation">Comoros</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa01">There is only one, indivisible China, and Taiwan is an integral part of the People's Republic of China. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States is a principle of the Charter of our universal Organization. Therefore, my country rejects inclusion of this issue in the agenda of the General Assembly.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vohidov</span> <span class="nation">Uzbekistan</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa01">It is a pleasure for me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the high post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. Those who worked with you as Permanent Representative to the United Nations will recall the high esteem with which you are regarded by your colleagues. That gives us every reason to believe that the management of this session will be distinguished by virtue of your excellent diplomatic skill, humanistic principles and political wisdom. For our part, we assure you that the delegation of Uzbekistan will fully support you as you carry out your duties.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa02">With regard to the matter before us, I have the honour to reiterate once more the basic position of the Government of Uzbekistan regarding the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China. In that regard, we reaffirm our full support for the position expressed by the representative of that country.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa03">The Government of Uzbekistan believes that the General Committee's recommendation, which reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of the Members of the Organization, is fully justified. Therefore, we firmly oppose inclusion in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the issue of Taiwan's membership application.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa01">This is the first time that my delegation has taken the floor at the sixty-second session of the General Assembly, and it is an honour and a pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, a representative from our region, on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. I am confident that your recognized diplomatic skill and your vast experience will lead us to success in the year ahead. You know that you can count on our entire cooperation and support to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa02">With regard to the matter at hand, the inclusion of item 165 of the draft agenda in the agenda of the sixty-second session, Romania's position has consistently been in line with the provisions and the spirit of resolution 2758 (XXVI), of which my country was a sponsor when it was adopted at the twenty-sixth session. That document addressed all political, legal and procedural aspects of China's representation at the United Nations. My delegation's position against inclusion of this item in the agenda is thus fully in line with the principles and goals enshrined in the Charter governing our Organization, starting with the basic principle of the universality of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa03">Romania has had long-standing diplomatic ties with China since 1949. The two countries maintain close relations of cooperation and friendship. Romania strongly supports China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United Nations remains an intergovernmental Organization composed of sovereign States. Romania therefore believes that the People's Republic of China is fully entitled to participate with one voice in the work and the activities of the United Nations.</p>
