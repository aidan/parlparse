	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the interim report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on the situation in Burundi, <a href="../pdf/S-2001-1076.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/1076</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council expresses its deep gratitude to Madiba Nelson Mandela of South Africa for his dedicated service to the people of Burundi and the cause of peace in Central Africa. Building on the work of his predecessor, the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Madiba has helped to give Burundi a chance for lasting peace, democracy, economic development and national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council had, in the statement of its President on 8 November 2001, welcomed the 1 November 2001 inauguration of Burundi's Transitional Government and expressed its appreciation for the instrumental role played by Madiba towards the creation of the Transitional Government. The Security Council had also expressed the hope that the region and the international community could continue to rely on his moral leadership and ingenious spirit, which are essential for progress towards peace in Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council acknowledges the sterling contribution of Madiba as facilitator of the Arusha peace process in bringing together all the parties, including the armed groups, to engage in dialogue in order to facilitate an early cessation of hostilities in accordance with the Arusha Agreement. The Security Council commends Madiba for his tenacity and unwavering commitment towards political reconciliation in Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its appreciation to Madiba and the South African Government for initiating the deployment of the first elements of the multinational security presence tasked with the protection of returning political leaders, without which the conditions would not have been conducive to the inauguration of the Burundi transitional Government. These key successes have confirmed the trust and confidence which the Security Council and the international community have always had in Madiba.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its concern about the recent increase in violence and reiterates its call for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Burundi. The Council calls on all Burundians to reject violence and to pursue their objectives through the institutions and mechanisms of the transition process. The Council appeals to all Burundians and United Nations Member States to build on the momentum created through the efforts of Madiba and to support the Regional Peace Initiative, the transitional Government and the Implementation Monitoring Committee."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-35.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/35</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
