	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">This afternoon the General Assembly will continue the election of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">As members will recall, when the 62nd plenary meeting was adjourned earlier today there still remained one seat to be filled from among the Asian States.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">In accordance with the rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to the third round of balloting, by secret ballot, for the remaining seat from among the Asian States.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">This third round of balloting shall be restricted to the two States from among the Asian States that were not elected but that obtained the largest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely, Cambodia and Jordan.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">This is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">Ballot papers will now be distributed. I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers for the Asian States the name of the State for which they wish to vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">Ballot papers will be declared invalid if they contain the name of a State other than Cambodia or Jordan as well as if they contain the name of more than one State.</p>
