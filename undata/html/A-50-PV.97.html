	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa10">Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' and had intended to pursue an amendment to this paragraph. In the spirit of cooperation and not to reopen a draft resolution which was passed by consensus, it has been agreed that, provided their concerns and understanding regarding operative paragraph 23 of that draft resolution were clearly understood, they would not pursue an amendment to the current text of the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa11">"In this regard, I wish to state that the reference to the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States at the end of operative paragraph 23 pertains to those States which are party to the Convention referred to in the paragraph.

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa14">There is a correction to be made in draft resolution I. The original eighteenth preambular paragraph should be reinstated. This paragraph reads as follows:</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa18">should be revised to read as follows:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa19">"Encouraged by measures taken by Governments to eradicate the economic exploitation of child labour".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa20">With respect to draft resolution II, the following delegations should be added to the list of sponsors of the draft resolution: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Germany, Guyana, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mali, the Marshall Islands, the Netherlands, Niger, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom and Uruguay.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa01">With reference to the draft resolution entitled "Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees" recommended for adoption by the plenary Assembly by the Third Committee, the delegation of Ukraine has the honour to state the following:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa02">Ukraine has always attached great importance to the problems of refugees. We highly appreciate the activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and commend its staff for the competent and dedicated manner in which it has performed its duties in a country which during recent years has become an asylum for tens of thousands of refugees from different parts of the world, especially from States members of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa03">Ukraine is particularly interested in strengthening the effectiveness of the activities of the UNHCR in settling the problems of refugees.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa04">The delegation of Ukraine actively participated in the elaboration of the present draft resolution, but, regrettably, it does not adequately reflect some of Ukraine's concerns. Moreover, the provisions of operative paragraph 23 are not in conformity with the national legislation of Ukraine.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa05">Conscious of the sensitive and complicated character of the issue and bearing in mind the numerous appeals from the representatives of different countries and organizations, the delegation of Ukraine will join in the consensus on the draft resolution on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, on the understanding that the provisions of operative paragraph 23 will apply only to those countries that are parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, in accordance with the provisions of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa06">Furthermore, Ukraine's consent to the provisions of operative paragraph 23 of the draft resolution should not, in any case, be interpreted as a granting of additional powers to the Commonwealth of Independent States on issues related to refugees.</div>

	Mrs. Castro de Barish (Costa Rica)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk13-pa01">Mr. President, I thank you for calling on me to present the draft resolution now before the General Assembly in document <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.61-Rev.1.pdf">A/50/L.61/Rev.1</a>. The purpose of the draft resolution is to present to the plenary General Assembly for approval the recommendation of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk13-pa02">The Conference of States parties, which was convened by the Secretary-General of the United Nations under article 50, paragraph 1, of the Convention held a meeting on 12 December 1995 to consider and take a decision on the amendment presented by the Government of Costa Rica to increase the number of experts described in article 43 as being</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg008-bk13-pa03">"of great moral integrity and recognized competence in matters related to the Convention".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk13-pa04">In this regard my Government proposed that the word "ten" in article 43, paragraph 2, be replaced by the word "eighteen". This amendment was approved by consensus by the Conference of States parties.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk13-pa05">The content of the first preambular paragraph of the draft resolution which I am now presenting has been recognized -- that is, the valuable contribution the experts made to the Committee by considering so many serious problems adversely affecting boys and girls of the world. They are the most valuable human resource which we States have, but they are also the most vulnerable of all social sectors. This is evident from the valuable reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the violations of the rights and moral and physical integrity of children, the exploitation of all kinds and the cruel suffering resulting from armed conflicts. Those are just some of the most deplorable, critical situations facing children.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk13-pa06">Furthermore, the spectacular increase in the number of States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child -- there are now 182, virtually reaching the goal of universality -- shows the keen interest which this Convention has aroused in the international community. This fully justifies the proposal for an increase in the number of experts on the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which now has only 10. The increase in the number of States parties has led to a considerable increase in the work of the Committee, which has, among its more important functions, the consideration and evaluation of the reports of those States in relation to their freely contracted obligations. But that is not all that the experts have to do under their mandate. This can easily be seen in various articles of the Convention, but I need mention only article 45, as a whole, to demonstrate that they have important and varied obligations. Therefore, it is logical to give the Committee a number of experts commensurate with the number of States parties to the Convention.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk13-pa07">The draft resolution which my delegation is now proposing to the General Assembly approves in operative paragraph 1 the amendment proposed to paragraph 2 of article 43 that replaces the word "ten" with the word "eighteen".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk13-pa08">Operative paragraph 2 was revised in order to include a suggestion that had been made. It uses the terms of paragraph 2 of article 50 of the Convention. Its purpose is to urge and encourage States parties to take appropriate measures to ensure that the required two-thirds majority of the States parties accept the amendment as soon as possible so that it can enter into force.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk13-pa09">Therefore, I respectfully and cordially appeal to all the representatives in the General Assembly to be good enough to adopt this draft resolution by consensus -- following the example of the Conference on States Parties to the Convention.</div>
