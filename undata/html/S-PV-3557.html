	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council is deeply concerned about the situation in and around the safe area of Zepa in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council notes the letter of 25 July 1995 from the President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the President of the Security Council (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-611.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/611</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms its previous relevant resolutions and itsstatement of 20 July 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-33.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/33</a>). It reiterates in the strongest possible terms its condemnation of the Bosnian Serb offensive against the safe area and demands that the Bosnian Serbs comply fully with the requirements set out in that statement as well as its earlier resolutions. The Council further demands that Bosnian Serb forces withdraw from the safe areas of Srebrenica and Zepa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council remains particularly concerned at the plight of the civilian population and other persons protected under international humanitarian law in the Zepa area. It welcomes and supports the efforts being made by UNPROFOR and the international humanitarian agencies, as requested by the President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to achieve a safe evacuation of those civilians who wish to leave and stresses the importance it attaches to the success of these efforts. It requests the Secretary-General to use all resources available to him to that end and calls on the parties to cooperate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council demands that UNPROFOR and the international humanitarian agencies be provided with immediate and unhindered access to the population of the area and, in particular, that the Bosnian Serb party provide access to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to all civilians who decide to remain and permit the ICRC to register any persons detained against their will and visit them immediately."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-34.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/34</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
