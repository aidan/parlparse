	Mr. Gabriel (Slovakia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It gives me great pleasure to introduce to the General Assembly the reports of the First Committee on agenda items 65 to 81. Those reports are contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-55-551">A/55/551</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-55-567">A/55/567</a> inclusive. In response to the Assembly's appeal, the Committee continued fully to utilize its existing resources, and it concluded its work at the current session in four and a half weeks, with 28 formal meetings.</div>
	<div class="p">The First Committee had before it 49 draft resolutions, one draft decision and one document containing amendments to draft resolutions for consideration. One draft resolution was eventually withdrawn. Of the 48 draft resolutions and one draft decision that were adopted, 27 -- or almost 60 per cent -- were adopted without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">The disarmament calendar for 2000 has been eventful. During the year, in various multilateral forums, member States have been addressing issues which range across the full spectrum of security and disarmament items. However, the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its Final Declaration clearly dominated, and in a way shaped, the discussions on the international disarmament agenda. Naturally, statements made by delegations cited the achievements of the Review Conference. They also reflected an increasing concern and readiness on the part of Member States to act with a high degree of cooperation in tackling those aspects of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament that should be addressed on a priority basis in the immediate future.</div>
	<div class="p">The discussion of those items in the course of the deliberations of the First Committee were focused on missile defence systems, especially on the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems (ABM Treaty); negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a fissile materials cut-off treaty; the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT); nuclear-weapon-free zones; and other such matters. Of course, concentrated attention was attracted also by the last stages of negotiations on the verification protocol to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction; the forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects; and other topical issues.</div>
	<div class="p">In that context, delegations noted that, in the atmosphere of high expectations prevailing following the conclusion of the NPT Review Conference, it is even more important to take a fresh look at nuclear disarmament in general with a view to adopting new, innovative and daring approaches. Consequently, a draft resolution entitled "Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda" was again submitted at this session and was again adopted by a great margin in favour.</div>
	<div class="p">Member States reaffirmed the importance of strengthening non-proliferation regimes globally. In that context, the issue of setting up new nuclear-weapon-free zones and of strengthening existing ones was the focus of the Committee's attention as a step towards achieving that goal. In that regard, the statement of the United States of America on behalf of the five permanent members of the Security Council, recognizing Mongolia's special status and extending security assurances to it, as well as the adoption by consensus of a draft resolution on Mongolia's international security and nuclear-weapon-free status, constituted a welcome new development.</div>
	<div class="p">The majority of delegations spoke of lost opportunities within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament. However, given the successful conclusion of the 2000 NPT Review Conference and the incorporation of language from its Final Declaration in the text of a draft resolution on the subject of a fissile materials cut-off treaty, that draft resolution, unlike similar texts in past years, was adopted without a vote. Overwhelming hope was expressed that this would pave the way for the possible establishment of an ad hoc committee of the Conference on Disarmament and that negotiations would start next year.</div>
	<div class="p">No less important to the Committee's work were items concerning the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction, increasing the number of States parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, and achieving universality for that treaty. These were recognized as most important by the majority of delegations.</div>
	<div class="p">The Committee also welcomed the progress achieved by the ad hoc group in pursuit of a mandate for a special conference as part of the ongoing efforts to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention.</div>
	<div class="p">While retaining their traditional aspects, regional and conventional disarmament have attained a new dimension that requires urgent and decisive action, with particular reference to the problem of small arms. The draft resolution on following up small arms issues in the forum of the United Nations Conference enjoyed wide support and succeeded in resolving some important outstanding issues. Furthermore, the Committee adopted a draft resolution on the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. It is a positive development that, like last year's text, the draft resolution was adopted without a vote and that the issue of a fourth special session will continue to be discussed at the 2001 session of the First Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">The First Committee also considered a draft resolution calling for a new study in 2003 relating to further improvement and development of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, to be prepared by a group of governmental experts. Divergence of views on specific measures for the further expansion of the Register's scope to include other categories of weapons still remained and were reflected in the voting pattern. At the same time, Member States took note of the call for fuller participation and greater openness by all States.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me now briefly turn to the reports of the First Committee and to draw the attention of delegations to some additions and to a few technical errors which have crept into the texts of the following documents.</div>
	<div class="p">Turning to document <a href="../pdf/A-55-552">A/55/552</a>, relating to agenda items 66 and 67, the first sentence of paragraph 7 should begin as follows:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"At the same meeting, the Committee adopted draft resolution A/C.1/55/L.47/Rev.1 by a recorded vote of 150 to none with no abstentions ..."</div>
	<div class="p">Then, as regards agenda item 75, in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-561">A/55/561</a>, page 2, Section II A, "Consideration of proposals", a new paragraph 5 has to be inserted, and should read as follows:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"On 6 October, the representative of France submitted a draft resolution entitled `Twentieth anniversary of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research' (A/C.1/55/L.3)."</div>
	<div class="p">Existing paragraph 5 becomes paragraph 6, and following it, a new paragraph 7 will be inserted.</div>
	<div class="p">In the revised draft, operative paragraph 5, which had read:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Recommends that means be sought of increasing the funding of the Institute"</div>
	<div class="p">has been revised to read:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Recommends that the Secretary-General of the United Nations seek ways to increase the funding of the Institute, within existing resources."</div>
	<div class="p">The subsequent paragraphs of the report will be numbered accordingly.</div>
	<div class="p">In document <a href="../pdf/A-55-565">A/55/565</a>, under agenda item 79, on page 2 the draft resolution symbol in the last line of paragraph 5 and in the second line of paragraph 6 should read as follows: "A/C.1/55/L.8*", with the addition of an asterisk.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to agenda items 73 and 74, I would like to inform delegations that, due to extreme time constraints in the processing of these two reports resulting from the General Assembly time schedule this year, there are a number of mostly editorial errors, which will require correction. In order to save time at this meeting, we will not take them up here; rather, they will be corrected by the Secretariat in due course. I would kindly ask delegations to take note of these corrections.</div>
	<div class="p">Before concluding, I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to all delegations for their spirit of cooperation in their participation in the work of the Committee. I should like to express special gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee, Ambassador U Mya Than, who, with his intimate knowledge of disarmament and international security matters, as well as his high diplomatic skills, provided the Committee with vision and able leadership.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me also thank the Committee's Vice-Chairmen, Ms Petra Schneebauer of Austria, Mr. Alberto Guani of Uruguay and Mr. Abdelkader Mesdoua of Algeria, who were most effective in discharging their duties.</div>
	<div class="p">I should also like to express my appreciation to the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, Mr. Jin Yongjian, and the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala for the leadership they have provided the Secretariat staff assisting the Committee and for their valuable contribution. Moreover, special thanks go to the Secretary of the First Committee, Mr. Lin Kuo-hung, whose vast experience and high degree of competence made a significant contribution to the successful outcome of the Committee's work. He will be missed by the Committee next year.</div>
	<div class="p">I should also express my gratitude to Mr. Mohammad Sattar, Mr. Timur Alasaniya, Mr. Saijin Zhang, Mrs. Tatyana Shestakova and Ms. Olga Sukovic and other officers of the Secretariat for their valuable assistance in the Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">With these brief remarks, I present the reports of the First Committee to the General Assembly for consideration, as contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-55-551">A/55/551</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-55-567">A/55/567</a>.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The President:</b> I thank the Rapporteur of the First Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the First Committee that are before the General Assembly today.</div>

	<div class="p"> Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote.</div>
	<div class="p">The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the First Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records.</div>
	<div class="p">May I remind Members that under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that "When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee".</div>
	<div class="p">May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</div>
	<div class="p">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the First Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the First Committee, unless notified otherwise in advance.</div>
	<div class="p">This means that where recorded or separate votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the First Committee.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Mladenovic" nation="Yugoslavia" language="">
	Mr. Mladenovic (Yugoslavia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">This being the first time that I am addressing the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency and to express my greatest satisfaction with your stewardship of the Assembly's proceedings thus far. I would like also to thank the members of the Bureau.</div>
	<div class="p">The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was not able to take an active part in the work of the United Nations at the time of the adoption of this resolution in the First Committee. Let me therefore take this opportunity to commend the wide support that the resolution received in the Committee and in the General Assembly today. This proves that the positions contained in the resolution are contributory to the efforts made by the countries of South-Eastern Europe to promote good-neighbourliness and cooperation and, by the same token, to consolidate peace and strengthen security in our region.</div>
	<div class="p">As the Assembly will recall, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has had the misfortune to be riven, in the last decade of the twentieth century, by war and conflict, and has had to endure enormous human suffering and material destruction. The profound democratic changes that have taken place in my country in the wake of the last elections have brought about the speedy reintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the international community and accounted for the creation of a new atmosphere in the region. The basis for a new relationship among the countries in the region is emerging.</div>
	<div class="p">The commitment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the development of relations with all its neighbours on the basis of genuine good-neighbourliness, mutual respect and cooperation is an important factor in the promotion of peace and overall stability in the region. This is evinced also by the recognition rendered both to the new leaders and the people of my country for their courage and resolve in bringing about the change, expressed also in the resolution at hand.</div>
	<div class="p">Now, as a fully fledged Member of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Stability Pact for South-east Europe, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia stands ready to bear its share of responsibility in the efforts aimed at fulfilling the goals and purposes enshrined in the basic documents of these organizations. In that way, my country will make a positive contribution to overcoming the traumas of the past and turn to solving, with the other countries of the region, the open questions through dialogue, cooperation and development. There is no doubt that this will help facilitate the integration of our region into the wider integrated processes of Europe.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation is convinced that the consistent implementation of this resolution will make an important contribution to meeting the aspirations of all of the countries of our region.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda items 66 and 67?</div>

	<div class="p">The General Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 73.</div>
	<div class="p">I shall call on those representatives who wish to speak in explanation of vote on the resolutions just adopted.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>Mr. Enkhsaikhan </b>(Mongolia) The General Assembly has just adopted an important resolution on promoting the goals of nuclear non-proliferation and the security of a Member State. This is a logical follow-up to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-770">resolution 53/770</a> D entitled "Mongolia's international security and nuclear-weapon-free status".</div>
	<div class="p">Since the adoption of that resolution, Mongolia has spared no effort to implement it. To that end, it has taken unilateral measures and worked with the relevant Member States and bodies of the United Nations. As a result, some important steps have already been taken. The Mongolian Parliament has adopted legislation on the country's nuclear-weapon-free status that defines and regulates that status at the national level. The five permanent members of the Security Council have also made a joint statement recently, providing Mongolia with nuclear security assurances.</div>
	<div class="p">Providing nuclear security assurances to nuclear-weapon-free zones has become an integral part of the emerging international non-proliferation regime. However, singling out a State and declaring that under certain circumstances nuclear weapons would not be used against it is a novelty that needs careful consideration, since, by implication, it may be interpreted as if the use or threat of use of other forms of force were not ruled out. Therefore, when a State is singled out for nuclear assurances, those assurances ought to be complemented by general assurances of non-use of force, unless, of course, the intention is otherwise.</div>
	<div class="p">As it is underlined in the resolution that has just been adopted, Mongolia enjoys friendly and good-neighbourly relations with both of its neighbours, China and Russia. Hence, the joint statement by the permanent members is viewed more as a symbolic gesture and an expression of their good will, and as a manifestation of their readiness to work towards the implementation of the resolution. Therefore, for a small single State such as Mongolia, of more direct and practical relevance is acquiring general security assurances, rather than nuclear ones. The latter alone would not at all correspond to the actual good state of relations of Mongolia with its neighbours, or with the other three nuclear-weapon States. We believe that an appropriate measure could be taken to that effect in the spirit of the resolution just adopted.</div>
	<div class="p">That resolution calls upon Member States and the relevant United Nations bodies to continue to cooperate with Mongolia in promoting and strengthening the non-nuclear aspects of its security. We are looking forward to that cooperation. There is a general understanding that strengthening Mongolia's security would make its nuclear-weapon-free status more stable and credible, which is important in promoting nuclear non-proliferation, stability and predictability in our part of the region. Since 1999, Mongolia has been working with representatives of the relevant United Nations bodies -- especially the Department for Disarmament Affairs -- to identify areas for possible future cooperation. We are prepared to continue our cooperation so as to produce, as pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report on this item, concrete and action-oriented approaches to address the non-nuclear aspects of Mongolia's security.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to take this opportunity to express my Government's appreciation and gratitude to the five nuclear-weapon States and to all other Member States and relevant United Nations bodies for their valuable support of Mongolia's initiative and for their cooperation in enhancing its security in conjunction with the noble cause of promoting the goals of nuclear non-proliferation.</div>

This additional one-week session will consist of 10 meetings, two a day, with interpretation in all six languages, and 60 pages of pre-session, 60 pages of in-session and 15 pages of post-session documentation in all languages.</div>
	<div class="p">The conference servicing requirements, at full cost, are estimated at $225,300. The extent to which the Organization's capacity would need to be supplemented by temporary assistance resources can be determined only in the light of the calendar of conferences and meetings for the 2000-2001 biennium. Provision is made, however, under section 2, Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, of the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 not only for meetings programmed at the time of budget preparation, but also for meetings authorized subsequently, provided that the number and distribution of meetings are consistent with the pattern of meetings of past years. Consequently, should the General Assembly approve the recommendations contained in draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.34-Rev.1">A/55/L.34/Rev.1</a>, no additional appropriations would be required in the biennium 2000-2001.</div>
