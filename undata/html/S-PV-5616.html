	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">On behalf of the members of the Security Council, I should like to welcome the participation in today's meeting of Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union, Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union, and to wish him every success in his important work during 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains a focus of attention for the Security Council. The country's first democratic elections in 40 years have resulted in the election of a President and the formation of a representative National Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">A new chapter is beginning in the history of the country. On the agenda now are local elections, which should take place by the end of 2007. All of these positive changes are the result of coordinated efforts on the part of the international community, first and foremost by the United Nations and its Security Council, the African Union, the European Union and other regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">An important contribution to the success of the Congolese peace process was also made by the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). Working jointly with the European Union, which was authorized by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1671(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1671 (2006)</a> to deploy a force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUC has assisted the Government in its efforts to ensure safety and security and the rule of law in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">At this meeting, we will hear briefings by Mr. Javier Solana, Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno and Mr. Ibrahim Gambari.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">Prior to those briefings, I shall first invite the representative of Germany to take the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Matussek</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The candidate countries Turkey and Croatia align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I would like to thank you for giving the European Union the opportunity to report on the implementation of the mandate of the European Union-led peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (EUFOR). I will make some introductory remarks and then ask you, Sir, to give the floor to the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union (EU), Mr. Javier Solana.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">A year ago, in late December 2005, the United Nations requested the European Union to provide additional security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo while the country went through the election process. The EU -- after close consultation with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- agreed to support the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to assist in ensuring security in the interest of a successful transition. In April 2006, the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1671(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1671 (2006)</a>, which authorized the European force. In July, EUFOR was launched as an autonomous EU-led operation within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy, with a total of 21 member States participating. As envisaged in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1671(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1671 (2006)</a>, EUFOR was concluded after four months, at the end of November.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Following operation Artemis in Bunia in summer 2003, the operation was another milestone of cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations in the field of peacekeeping in Africa. The EU and the United Nations -- both at the level of headquarters and of the missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- worked together intensively before and during the operation. Our joint efforts helped to provide stability, defuse tensions and deter potential spoilers during critical stages of the election process. The lessons drawn from that experience will be important for our future partnership in the field of crisis management, which is growing ever more intensive. That increasing cooperation must be accompanied by appropriate mechanisms of dialogue and exchange -- issues we should look into in the coming months.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The European Union warmly welcomes the success of the first democratic elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in more than 40 years and congratulates the Congolese people on that major step towards stabilization and reconstruction in a spirit of national reconciliation. The European Union calls on all political players to engage constructively in the post-transition process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The European Union recalls the substantial efforts it has undertaken in support of the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the political level, as well as through instruments of the European Security and Defence Policy, the EU Electoral Observation Mission and the assistance provided through the European Development Fund and, bilaterally, by EU member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The EU remains fully committed to continuing its support for the consolidation of stability and reconstruction, notably through assuming a coordinating role for international efforts in the security sector, in close cooperation with the United Nations, to support the Congolese authorities in that field. It is essential that future cooperation be based on the new authorities' strong commitment to good governance and to strengthening the rule of law. Appropriate flexible mechanisms will need to be developed with the new Congolese Government to ensure effective coordination of support and political dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">In concluding, let me thank the people, the Government and the political actors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for their confidence in the European force, which demonstrated its neutrality and effectiveness throughout its mandate. The EU is also grateful to the Government of Gabon, which allowed the European force to use Gabon as an important base for the operation. We appreciated the excellent cooperation with the United Nations, both in New York and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and with the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We hope that the successful elections will be the first step towards a brighter future for the Congolese people and the entire region of the Great Lakes.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to Mr. Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Solana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01"> It is for me a pleasure to have been invited to participate in this important meeting about the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">As has been said already, the request of the United Nations almost a year ago for military support came at a crucial point in time. The transition period in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had entered its final phase, and it was essential to create the necessary conditions and security environment to ensure a successful outcome. The European Union had worked very hard for a number of years to facilitate the democratic transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Elections were the final success. We could not fail, and we responded positively to the United Nations request to put soldiers on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">We deployed a military force with operational headquarters provided by Germany, a European Union presence in Kinshasa, and a force element in Gabon, ready to be deployed as necessary. I would like to draw attention to that structure. By keeping an over-the-horizon force in Gabon, we ensured simultaneously a deterrent capacity and avoided an unnecessary heavy military presence in Kinshasa. In fact, the deterrence effect of the European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR) was a significant factor in limiting the number of incidents. Reinforcement by additional force elements from the over-the-horizon component in Gabon was undertaken on a number of occasions. In addition, a number of deployment operations to the geographically agreed points of application were undertaken. That served also to increase the geographic spread of the force's deterrent effect.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">The incident with the greatest destabilizing potential occurred on 21 August 2006 with an attack on Vice-President Bemba's residence. EUFOR intervention, in close cooperation with the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), was decisive in containing the potential spread of violence at a particularly sensitive moment in the election process. In addition to that, EUFOR confirmed its position of neutrality in the eyes of the Congolese population and reinforced its credibility.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">We can state today that the mission has been a success, both in the way it has been conducted and in its contribution to the overall positive conclusion of the transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although a lessons-learned review is under way, some key elements for its success can already be identified: the definition of a clear mandate, both in scope and in time frame; highly professional troops, to whom I wish to pay tribute; a very high degree of interaction with MONUC, which I believe to have been fundamental; and an active communication policy, both towards the Congolese population and to key actors in the electoral process. In a wider context, transparency and information-sharing with African partners, the African Union and other African regional organizations invited to deploy liaison officers also facilitated the process.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Solana</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Military intervention makes real sense only if it is part of a comprehensive commitment. That is particularly true for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the European Union deployed the full range of its political, civilian, military, financial and development resources in a consistent approach and in close cooperation with all regional and international stakeholders. In that regard, the relationship that has been built with the United Nations reflects the joint statement issued by the two organizations on 24 September 2003. I can today confirm that it is along those lines that the European Union is determined to continue to work with the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The Democratic Republic of the Congo can now look forward to its future with greater confidence. Credit for that goes to the international community, but especially to the Congolese themselves, who have chosen the path of reconciliation. In that connection, I should like to pay tribute to the Congolese people, those they have elected, the Independent Electoral Commission and national and international observers. Working together, they have made it possible to properly carry out the first democratic elections in the country in more than 40 years.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">However, we must still face significant challenges. The inaugural address made by President Kabila included the key principles on the basis of which the European Union is prepared to continue its commitment. Those include good governance, democracy, the rule of law, an opening to the opposition and, in particular, priority to security and security sector reform. With regard to security, the European Union has already launched military and police missions. We are currently considering ways to strengthen those missions.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Allow me, in closing, to say that we believe that MONUC and Special Representative Bill Swing have made decisive efforts on the ground in recent years and months. Those efforts will continue to be equally decisive in the future, both in assisting the new institutions and in further strengthening stability in the east of the country. Like the United Nations, the European Union will remain committed to that goal.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Solana for his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">I now give the floor to Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guéhenno</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">I am grateful for this opportunity to reiterate once again the United Nations appreciation to the European Union and the 21 member States, including Turkey, who have participated in the European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR). I should also like to thank the High Representative, whose personal commitment has greatly contributed to the success of the operation. In extending its support to the Congolese people, EUFOR contributed to establishing an environment of stability in which to carry out the elections held in July and October 2006, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1671(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1671 (2006)</a> of 25 April 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">For the United Nations, that has been a very positive experience. The presence of EUFOR was quite valuable during the critical period of the elections, at which time the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and the United Nations Development Programme joined their efforts with other international actors and the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Independent Electoral Commission to organize and carry out this complex undertaking, which was the largest electoral exercise that the United Nations has ever supported since the inception of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">EUFOR complemented MONUC's massive effort by adding its extra capacity and flexibility and by helping to address security challenges and any potential escalation that could have arisen from developments in the country. That cooperation was particularly effective following the violent incidents in Kinshasa last August. EUFOR's presence was also an important element in the deterrent role played by United Nations military and police forces on the ground, which in turn supported the Congolese national police. In that connection, more than 40,000 Congolese police were trained by MONUC to help create a secure environment for the electoral process.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">While acknowledging the outstanding effort of the European Union, we should also like to note with appreciation the generous assistance of Germany, which provided the operational headquarters for EUFOR in Potsdam. We should also like to take this opportunity to note the sizable number of troops deployed to EUFOR by the Governments of Germany and France. The excellent cooperation that developed between EUFOR and MONUC and between the United Nations Secretariat and the general secretariat of the Council of the European Union serves as an example for future cooperative efforts. I should also emphasize that that cooperation included operational military aspects as well as the logistical support provided by MONUC to EUFOR in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">The deployment of EUFOR in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was a further demonstration of the European Union's ongoing strong support for the United Nations throughout the Congolese peace process, especially during difficult moments. In that connection, we all recall Operation Artemis. The joint implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1671(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1671 (2006)</a> produced many positive lessons, including the importance of early coordination at the technical level and of mutual understanding of each organization's concepts and procedures. We have already started drawing such lessons together, and we will continue to work together to determine how we can build on that experience in planning other operations in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">The United Nations Secretariat is determined to fully exploit the strategic and operational potential of partnerships with various multilateral organizations, including in the very important area of security sector reform. In that regard, we welcome the support of the European Union mission to provide advice and assistance for security sector reform in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (EUSEC) and the European Union Police Mission in Kinshasa (EUPOL), which continue to make very important contributions in the areas of security sector and police reform.</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline-spokein" id="pg005-bk03">
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa01"><i>spoke in English</i></p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guéhenno</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa01">It is difficult to overemphasize the significance of the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to which the United Nations and the European Union, together with many other Member States, have contributed. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many individual member States of the Council, and in particular South Africa, for their outstanding support to that vital endeavour. Only a few years ago, few observers believed that the Democratic Republic of the Congo would be able to rise to the challenge of ending the conflict and holding its first democratic elections since 1960.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa02">The credit for those elections goes to the Congolese people, who conducted themselves throughout with patience, courage, great dignity and determination. Their desire for change has been the main driving force of the electoral process. Credit is also due to the Independent Electoral Commission, which operated in a war-torn country with little or no infrastructure, poor communications and limited transportation. Despite criticism, pressure and occasional threats from different quarters, the Electoral Commission carried out in full its historic mission. All international partners should take great pride in having supported the Congolese people and its institutions in successfully passing this milestone.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa03">MONUC has been the largest and most expensive United Nations peacekeeping operations in the world, with thousands of troops and over 100 aircraft. Five peace accords involving African countries, more than 35 Security Council resolutions, African Union and Southern African Development Community involvement, $500 million in international electoral funding and strong support from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, have all contributed to the success of the peace process. The European Union in particular has played a crucial role at several critical electoral junctures over the last several years.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa04">The events of the last few months have produced a new positive dynamic in the country. On the 30 December, President Kabila appointed Mr. Antoine Gizenga, former presidential candidate in the first round of the elections, as Prime Minister. Mr. Gizenga is currently consulting on the formation of a Government, which is expected to be completed this month. At the end of December, the National Assembly elected Mr. Vital Kamerhe as President of the National Assembly, along with six other members of the National Assembly bureau. All seven are members of President Kabila's Alliance for the Presidential Majority.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa05">In the meantime, fighting between the Forces Armées de la Republic Democratic du Congo (FARDC) and the renegade forces of Laurent Nkunda in North Kivu has subsided over the last few days, and discussions, with the assistance of the United Nations, are being held between representatives of both sides. While the situation is still volatile, the Government of Rwanda reported that it was facilitating discussions between representatives of the FARDC and the Nkunda group in Kigali.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa06">On 4 January, an agreement was reached in principle to form mixed FARDC brigades by merging the Nkunda forces with other soldiers presently deployed in North Kivu. MONUC continues to encourage the Government to find a peaceful and comprehensive solution that will address the causes of this still-simmering conflict in the eastern part of the country, and in that connection has facilitated the establishment of working groups to implement the agreements reached, with a view to resolving the underlying issues.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa07">In Ituri, a new ceasefire between the FARDC and the National Integrationist Front, led by Peter Karim, was agreed upon on 2 January after fighting had broken out near the town of Fataki at the end of December. The situation remains very tense, with the United Nations conducting robust operations in support of Government troops.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa08">We welcome the progress achieved at the summit meeting of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, which took place on 14 and 15 December in Nairobi, and we look forward to the implementation of the Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region, which will no doubt assist in further stabilizing the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa09">MONUC stands ready to support the newly elected Government as it begins to address the many challenges facing the country, including completing the transitional agenda and implementing the provisions of the new constitution, particularly in regard to strengthening national unity, fostering the democratic process and embarking on a comprehensive governance reform agenda. The Government will continue to be assisted in rebuilding a State free from corruption that ensures the rule of law and good governance, protects human rights and civil liberties, encourages participation and pluralism, conducts major security sector reform and is committed to reducing poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa10">The continued engagement of the international community is also required to help the Democratic Republic of the Congo complete a comprehensive electoral process, with local elections due in the second half of this year. We are looking forward to close cooperation with the European Union and other parties on all these fronts.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa11">The achievements of the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be at risk if the international community, or the Congolese people, repeat some of our past mistakes. Early disengagement following elections elsewhere resulted in the resumption of conflict a few years later, requiring a new, costlier international intervention.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa12">The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the natural, yet still developing, pole of stability in the troubled region of Central Africa. The resolution of the crisis in that country will benefit Africa more than solving any other of the continent's current conflicts. Moreover, if Africa's worst conflict can be overcome, then other conflicts can be overcome as well. We are confident that our partnership with the European Union and other stakeholders will serve this strategic goal.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa13">We are grateful for the Security Council's steadfast support for a settlement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has been demonstrated, among other things, by the Council's numerous visits to the country. We trust that the Security Council will remain actively involved in reinforcing and consolidating the input of the many bilateral and multilateral actors.</p>

I wish also to commend Mr. Solana in particular for his leadership role in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The successful holding of elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo towards the end of 2006 is now a matter of historical record. Although elections are never an end in themselves, they are, when credible, a critical part of any democratic process. Holding successful and credible elections as the international community did in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, led by the United Nations, is a testimony to what can be achieved when there is a collective effort.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">The Department of Political Affairs (DPA) is charged by the General Assembly with coordinating and supporting all United Nations electoral activity. DPA, through its Electoral Assistance Division, has been involved with the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 2003, when it conducted the initial needs assessment which preceded the establishment of the Electoral Division of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). DPA has continued to provide ongoing advice and support to our colleagues in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and MONUC in the largest electoral assistance mission ever conducted by this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The role of the United Nations electoral team, which includes the Projet d'appui au processus electoral en République Démocratique du Congo (APEC), a programme supported by the United Nations Development Programme, has been to support the Independent Electoral Commission of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at the IEC headquarters, as well as in field offices nationwide.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">On 18 and 19 December 2005, the Independent Electoral Commission, with the support of MONUC, organized the constitutional referendum, in which the Congolese voted overwhelmingly to adopt the constitution, which was subsequently promulgated on 18 February 2006. The voter registration exercise conducted between June and December 2005 resulted in the establishment of voters lists containing the names of 25.5 million eligible voters. Once again, I wish to join my colleague, Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, in congratulating the Commission, and especially its Chairman, the indefatigable Abbe Malu Malu, on these monumental achievements.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">The first round of presidential and national assembly elections were held on 30 July 2006. DPA also conducted several field missions in the country in 2006 to assist the MONUC Electoral Division with the operational planning for the 30 July and 29 October elections. From its roster of electoral experts, DPA continues to provide clearance for electoral staff and consultants.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">In my own capacity as United Nations Focal Point for Electoral Assistance Activities, I visited the country in early October, along with Mr. Craig Jenness, Director of my Electoral Assistance Division. I met with the major stakeholders, including the two candidates, to encourage an environment of calm, tolerance and national reconciliation during and after the electoral process. In light of the disturbances following the first round of results, I specifically stressed the need for positive and constructive campaigning, conducted in accordance with the electoral code of conduct. I also urged acceptance of the results by all parties and avoidance of a winner-takes-all attitude by the successful candidates.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">The presidential run-off and the provincial assembly elections were subsequently held, as we know, on 29 October. The conduct of these elections by the Electoral Commission, including the transparency of the count and tabulation process, was generally praised by international observers, the media, and several world leaders. Observers noted that, in spite of the enormous logistical challenges involved, these elections reflected the outcomes of lessons learned from the first round of elections -- that is, more efficient collection of results from the 50,000 polling stations in 12,000 locations, greater transparency in the electoral operations and improved training of the 250,000 polling workers. As a matter of fact, during my visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo last October, I observed firsthand in Mbandaka, in Equateur province, several training sessions for some of those polling officials.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">The elections have resulted in the establishment of the first democratically elected national institutions in more than four decades. Of that, we can all be justly proud -- most especially, the Congolese themselves. However, much still needs to be done. The Global and All-Inclusive Agreement of 2002 called for free and transparent elections to be held at all levels, including local elections. Therefore, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is now in a post-transitional period. But this is by no means a post-electoral period, because indirect elections by the provincial assemblies for senators, governors and vice-governors are expected to take place by the end of this month.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa10">Local elections for municipal and rural councils are expected in the latter part of 2007. As a matter of fact, there are several legislative prerequisites for that to take place. The organic law establishing the post-transition national Independent Electoral Commission, mandated under the constitution to organize and conduct elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, still needs to be adopted. Similarly, the law on decentralization, which would define the new provinces in accordance with the constitution, as well as the local constituencies for administrative and electoral purposes, must be adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa11">Following the adoption of those legislative instruments, the Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of Political Affairs will continue to assist MONUC's Electoral Division in providing capacity-building and support to the new election commission -- particularly in finalizing the modalities for the local elections -- as well as a voter registration update and operational preparations for and conduct of the 6,000 polls of the local elections. That effort could take anywhere from 13 to 18 months, depending on the modalities chosen. The actual elections will probably not begin before September 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa12">The establishment of local structures and institutions that have been freely chosen by their constituents is, in our view, essential for the legitimate extension of State authority, improved governance and the building of durable peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which will have consequences for the region. As has been stated, the Great Lakes region is an area in which we are following very closely developments in the areas of governance, development and security.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa13">Permit me to express our gratitude to our colleagues in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and MONUC and to our European Union partners. It was only by pooling our resources, ideas and expertise and by sharing responsibilities that the international community was able to deliver in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, despite the challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa14">In conclusion, I encourage the members of the Security Council and other partners, such as the European Union, the African Union, South Africa, Turkey and others, to continue to provide the generous assistance that they rendered during the 2006 electoral process. The logistical challenges in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remain. The Council's continued support for the electoral process through financial, technical and other assistance, as well as its endorsement of the Secretary-General's proposals for local elections, will be very critical in that regard.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I shall now give the floor to those Council members who wish to make comments or ask questions in response to the briefings that we have just heard.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lacroix</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I should like at the outset to welcome the presence of Mr. Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union (EU), and to thank him for his briefing. I should also like to thank Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno and Mr. Ibrahim Gambari for their briefings.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">My delegation fully associates itself with the statement made earlier by the Permanent Representative of Germany, which holds the EU presidency. I will thus limit myself to a few brief observations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">France is pleased to have participated in Operation EUFOR RD Congo, established by the EU at the request of the United Nations to contribute to the security environment at the end of the transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">In 2003, France assumed the role of lead nation for the operation that the EU had deployed in Ituri, Operation Artemis. The deployment in 2006 of a new operation headed by another lead nation is a major development for the European Security and Defence Policy. We are pleased that this new stage has been achieved in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Indeed, the success of the transition process that that country is completing is essential for the stability of the African continent as a whole. Following the transition period, the international community must continue to assist the country. The United Nations and the European Union will each have a role to play during this new period.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">The deployment of Operation EUFOR RD Congo also illustrates the usefulness of cooperation between the United Nations and the EU. That cooperation should continue to expand, particularly in the areas of crisis prevention and peacekeeping. In that regard, we should benefit fully from the experience acquired during Operation EUFOR RD Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">Finally, my delegation would like to commend the Congolese people for their sense of responsibility, which enabled them to hold elections that went smoothly, and to complete the transition in a generally peaceful atmosphere. The resolve of the Congolese people to take their future into their own hands and the responsible commitment of all Congolese political actors will be the key to the reconstruction and development of the country.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Verbeke</span> <span class="nation">Belgium</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I wish to thank Mr. Solana for his briefing to the Council, which shows once again the attention that the Council rightly pays to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Belgium welcomes Operation EUFOR RD Congo, in which we took an active part, particularly by providing the Force with information capacities. The EUFOR mission, in support of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), has made a vital contribution, especially through its deterrent effect in establishing the conditions necessary for the smooth conduct of the electoral process, as well as respect for the election results. Its intervention during the August events in Kinshasa demonstrated both its credibility and its impartiality.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Therefore, as we have stated, the EUFOR mission is a good example of the commitment undertaken by the European Union (EU) and the United Nations to cooperate in crisis management, in accordance with the 2003 declaration. A lessons-learned exercise is proving useful and will be carried out at both the European level and the United Nations level. The conclusions of such an assessment -- Mr. Guéhenno has already referred to a number of elements -- could foster the development of the framework for the relations between the EU and the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Belgium believes that the EU's commitment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo should continue in this post-transition period through a strengthened commitment to reform of the security sector. During the European Council meeting held on 15 December 2006, the EU confirmed its readiness to assume a coordinating role in international efforts in the security sector, in close cooperation with the United Nations and with the support of the Congolese authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Belgium duly appreciates the crucial role played by MONUC in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Council should soon take up the question of revising and extending its mandate. Belgium will take an active part in the discussion to redefine the mandate in the new, post-electoral context.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">Finally, my delegation remains extremely concerned at the situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially the continuing fighting in North Kivu. MONUC should intensify its efforts with a view to a lasting stabilization of that fragile part of the country. Those efforts should, we believe, be further based on a political approach.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Bader</span> <span class="nation">Qatar</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I would like first to most warmly thank the representative of Germany and Mr. Javier Solana, the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union, as well as Mr. Guéhenno and Mr. Gambari, for the briefings they have given us here in the Council this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">As we have all agreed unanimously, the Security Council will continue to deal closely with the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo even though the historic elections have already been crowned with success. As planned, the Government is now in a building phase, and we are pleased by President Kabila's appointment of Mr. Antoine Gizenga as Prime Minister. We hope most earnestly that he will be welcomed by the people of the country and that the President will be able to complete the formation of a Government that will fully discharge its responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The successful formation of the Government will help the Secretary-General to conduct fruitful consultations with the Congolese authorities on the future of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) after its current mandate ends on 15 February 2007. There will be an advent of a new Government for the country, after all the remaining electoral stages have been completed and the Secretary-General has presented a report with useful recommendations to the Council at the end of the month so that it might take an appropriate decision regarding the future MONUC mandate. We hope we can agree on that before mid-February, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1671(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1671 (2006)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">We wish to say how greatly we appreciate the role of the European forces (EUFOR). They have played a crucial role in assisting and supporting MONUC during the presidential elections. That considerably helped to stabilize that enormous country, which is faced with turmoil that continues to beset the country, especially in the east. We hope the situation will be stabilized when the European forces withdraw and that the new Government will be able to work with all the Congolese parties to ensure progress for the country.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">With regard to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, we welcome the news of the negotiations among the three factions in Ituri, which is a step along the path to disarmament and the reconstruction of the country. These factions were the Cobra Matata militia, the United National Front and the Revolutionary Congolese Movement. All of this means that it will be possible to reintegrate more than 8,000 men into the armed forces. We would like to say how greatly we appreciate the efforts of MONUC in the efforts currently under way and the agreements concluded with these militias so that the agreement might be consolidated. We also welcome the news that 60 individuals under the dissident General Nkunda, in South Kivu, have also joined the disarmament programme. We hope to have news that is just as satisfactory about the remaining militias.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">The humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo does not yet allow us to be optimistic, but rather causes concern. Efforts are still ongoing to help tens of thousands of people displaced from villages, who are benefiting from the assistance of UNICEF and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). OCHA is making considerable efforts to assist them by providing supplies and means for their subsistence. We hope that assistance from donors will continue, especially from the European Union. We hope too that the Democratic Republic of the Congo will continue to receive bilateral assistance or multilateral aid so that the Government might be able to consolidate the pillars for the new authorities, thereby ensuring progress for the country through the use of its natural resources for its own prosperity.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Christian</span> <span class="nation">Ghana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Allow me to thank the High Representative, Mr. Javier Solana, Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno and Under-Secretary-General Gambari for their briefings. We wish to commend the European Union for the security provided during the elections period.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the swearing into office of President Joseph Kabila reflect the people's desire for peace, stability and development. Similarly, the consolidation of peace for socio-economic development in the country requires enormous efforts to strengthen its democratic institutions. That is all the more so because poorly functioning institutions entrench corruption, chronic economic mismanagement and repression of opposition, and ill-disciplined and uncontrolled security forces had almost led to the country's collapse.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">We welcome the nomination of Mr. Antoine Gizenga, leader of the Unified Lumumbist Party, as Prime Minister. We hope that the Prime Minister will engage in consultations will all political parties, civil society and other stakeholders to enable him to form a Government of national unity. Similarly, we welcome the election of Mr. Vital Kamerhe as President of the National Assembly, and we look forward to the successful election of state governors, vice-governors and senators.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">However, we wish to express concern about the precarious security situation in the eastern part of the country, where the national army force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- the FARDC -- and the rebel fighters of the National Integrationist Front -- the FNI -- are engaged in conflict, particularly in the Ituri district. These armed conflicts have led to an increase in the number of internally displaced persons, forced labour and summary executions. The lack of security has also resulted in frequent violations of human rights and the rule of law. The widespread culture of impunity that allows the repetition of crimes by well-known persons who should be protecting the population is of great concern to us. It is, however, encouraging to note that the Government of Rwanda is mediating talks between the Congolese Government and General Laurent Nkunda's rebel group. We urge both parties to rise above personal and sectional interests and allow peace and stability to return to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">While commending the United Nations, the European Union, the international community and Congo's development partners for their various contributions to peace and stability in that country, we also express our appreciation to the member countries of the Great Lakes region for having signed a Pact which, hopefully, will pave the way for security, stability and development in the region. The provisions of the Pact, which include a security action plan to disarm rebel groups in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and along the border areas in the Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, should help to bring peace and stability to the region.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">The implementation of the Pact will, however, require financial support and coherent assistance from the international community. It is also of utmost importance that there be follow-up on the national implementation of the legal protocols adopted in the Pact. The protocols on governance, humanitarian and social issues address the cruel violence against women and children, the property rights of returning persons, the protection of internally displaced persons and economic programmes. There is also a non-aggression and mutual defence protocol, under which those countries will not tolerate the presence of insurgents on their territories. Those protocols are of the utmost importance and vital to peace and stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">Finally, we reiterate the crucial role of the security and judicial sectors in post-conflict Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we urge the Government and its development partners to intensify efforts in the area of judicial and security sector reforms. That will undoubtedly require the support of the major donor partners. We therefore urge the international community not to abandon the Democratic Republic of the Congo prematurely but instead to build a partnership with the newly elected authorities, consolidate peace and promote economic recovery.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ikouebe</span> <span class="nation">Congo</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Allow me at the outset to welcome Mr. Solana and to express my deep appreciation for his briefing. I should like also to thank the representative of Germany, who spoke on behalf of the European Union, as well as Mr. Guéhenno and Mr. Gambari, for the very useful information that they have provided us this morning. Above all, I should like, as a neighbour of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on behalf of the African Union, to thank the European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR), which made a significant contribution to the success of the process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There is no doubt that this experience will prove useful in the context of future theatres of operation, in Africa in particular. I should like therefore to reiterate the deep gratitude of my country and of Africa in particular for that very valuable contribution.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Like the majority of those who spoke before me, we welcome the smooth holding of the elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Credit is of course due to the people and the leaders of that country, as well as to the entire international community. When we speak of the international community, let us not forget that Africa itself played an active role in this process. Indeed, proof of this is the role played by countries such as South Africa in organizing the political dialogue that led to the establishment of the transitional institutions, and the role played by that country, as well as by Angola, in the area of military training.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">African involvement is also evident from the continent's participation in the International Committee for Support to the Transition (CIAT). Representatives of the Chairman of the African Union and of the Chairman of the African Union Commission have taken part, along with other members, in CIAT meetings. The subregion itself, the Economic Community of Central African States, has set up, in case of need, a reserve brigade.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">However, even as we welcome the success of this process, I would like to stress the need for the international community to continue its efforts. I greatly appreciated the commitment made here by the European Union to continue to support the efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, because there could be very serious consequences if we let up our vigilance.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The elections, as noted earlier, are indeed an important stage, but they are only a stage. That is because most of the major problems still remain to be solved. One was mentioned in particular: that of security sector reform, which will be crucial.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">In assessing the situation, we also take account of the results of the second Summit of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, which just took place at Nairobi. We must from now on consider the process as a whole within the framework of that Conference's outcome. Indeed, the Great Lakes region has been declared a special development zone. The international community is expected to make its contribution, and, in that respect, Europe is a leading partner. We must therefore take into account the regional dimension of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in our discussions in the days to come on the future of MONUC's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">I should like once again to thank the Security Council, the European Union and all of our partners for the great interest they have shown in the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and I urge them to continue their efforts.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Liu Zhenmin</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">First of all, I should like to thank the representative of Germany and Mr. Solana for their respective briefings. I wish also to thank Mr. Guéhenno and Mr. Gambari for their briefings.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">China wishes to congratulate the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the successful holding of the elections there. China expresses its appreciation to the European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR) for the assistance it provided to the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in the accomplishment of parts of MONUC's mandate in the general elections. We deem highly positive the constructive role played by EUFOR in the maintenance of peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Although EUFOR's mandate has expired, we hope that the EU will continue to support the democratic process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, actively provide economic assistance and help the new Government in carrying out security sector reform, so as to make a new round of contributions to the achievement of durable peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The Democratic Republic of the Congo is actively engaged in the formation of a new Government, and post-conflict reconstruction will soon be under way. The international community must devote the necessary attention to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. China is in favour of MONUC's continuing to play an important role in the Democratic Republic of the Congo so that the very fragile peace there can be maintained. China will also continue to provide the necessary assistance to the Democratic Republic of the Congo so as to play its part in the peaceful reconstruction of the country.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">If I may, I should like to thank those who have briefed us, and especially to extend a warm welcome to the High Representative of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">Let me begin by aligning myself with the statements or comments made earlier on behalf of the European Union by Ambassador Matussek.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">What we have heard is a very good and welcome example of the cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations. It is also indicative of the welcome progress being achieved in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno set out very starkly what that represents. What we have to do now is build on it and all of us maintain our strong continuing support for the new Congolese authorities in what is going to be a crucial stage of reconciliation and peace consolidation. It is not unqualified support, however. Again, the Under-Secretary-General set out what we expect of the Democratic Republic of the Congo authorities, and that is absolutely right.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">What we look forward to as the Council are recommendations from the Secretary-General as to how the United Nations should carry forward its support for the Democratic Republic of the Congo in that next phase, and how we can assist and follow up the existing mandate, which expires on 15 February. We are inclined to believe that the principal role will be to maintain stability, to allow the institutions to take root, and to redirect resources towards the priorities. Those must include tackling the activities of the armed groups in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo that are at the moment preying on civilians and undermining the chances for lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">I would also note that the Lord's Resistance Army is in Garamba, for the most part despite the discussions in the Juba process. That remains, for many of us, a keen interest, and one way or another we must tackle that issue, too.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">If I may, I should just like to say a few words about European security defence policy. What this operation demonstrates very clearly is the real-world contribution which the European Union is making through that policy to tackling international issues. In many cases, it is in support of and in partnership with the United Nations. That, as far as the United Kingdom is concerned, is one of the major objectives of European security defence policy. It is to project a foreign policy and, as appropriate, a military dimension in support of operations out there which not only conform to common policies of the European Union, but which sit very neatly with objectives of the United Nations. It is the capacity of the European Union as it is now developing to be able to deploy forces rapidly and to do so in an efficient manner, as we have demonstrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which actually highlights the path that the European Union can, does and, I hope, will increasingly play.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">I put that in stark contrast to what we tend not to do in United Nations peacekeeping, but I do want to flag up that, whereas the European Union and its member States are less active in United Nations peacekeeping, there is another dimension that is very important. The capacity to rapidly deploy when necessary is something which contributes very strongly, I believe, to the international effort.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">The European Union battle group concept takes that further forward, the intention being that a battle group could be deployed with 15-days' notice to areas of need. That is a capacity which the United Nations and the world often need, and which is very rarely available, so I very much welcome that development by the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">If I may, I have two specific questions for High Representative Solana. The first concerns the fact that, as the European security defence policy is created, it has a particular link with NATO. I am struck by the fact that one of our institutional problems in the United Nations is how the Organization relates to the African Union not just as we take forward the African Union Mission in Sudan, but also as we move towards the hybrid operation in Darfur, which we all want to see as soon as possible. Are there any lessons from how the European Union has learned to work with other organizations that Mr. Solana might want to share with us to suggest how the United Nations can carry forward that very necessary cooperation with and direct support for a nascent operational capability within the African Union?</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Secondly, is what we have heard described this morning potentially an exemplar, a good practice, that one could look at to determine where the European Union might be more active in helping tackle the many different and, in many cases, difficult situations that we confront in Africa?</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Voto-Bernales</span> <span class="nation">Peru</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I should like to thank the Permanent Representative of Germany and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union, Mr. Javier Solana, for their briefings. I also thank Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno and Mr. Ibrahim Gambari.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">We join others in expressing our satisfaction at the successful conclusion of a crucial phase in the post-conflict transition process to democracy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In their organization, management and outcome, the elections, which we have repeatedly referred to here and which are the topic of this meeting, represent an important achievement for the authorities and people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In that context, it is apt to recognize the decisive contribution of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the significant security, political, diplomatic, military and economic presence of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Given the historical background of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and that country's strategic importance in Africa, it is also important that its democratic transition be carefully planned and to continue to provide support to its authorities in the upcoming phase of elections for the Senate and for provincial governors and deputy governors. We feel it necessary to note that it is now up to the international community, development agencies and the Democratic Republic of the Congo's partners to plan the future of international cooperation so as to help the new democratic Government in the peacebuilding process and to continue the transition towards an integrated society at peace and moving towards development.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">We are pleased to recognize the progress that has been made in institutional reform and the interest in strengthening the capacities and legitimacy of the authorities. We are also pleased to note the support role being played by South Africa, a current member of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">We are optimistic that internal security, the full rule of law and human rights will be the focus of ongoing attention from the Government and society of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In that context, we will closely follow the dialogue and peacebuilding process in that country.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kumalo</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I, too, wish to welcome Mr. Solana. It is always good to hear him brief on African issues, in which he is deeply involved. We also appreciate the briefings we received from Mr. Guéhenno and Mr. Gambari on their support of the process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Everything that has happened so far in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is due to the Congolese people. We wish to pay tribute to the Congolese people for having achieved what they have achieved so far. We look forward to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo taking shape, because we would also like to take our lead from that Government about the way forward. We hope that the support of the European Union will continue in the Congo, because the Congo still has a difficult road ahead. As has been mentioned here, there are still critical elections ahead of us. We as South Africa pledge ourselves to continue to assist the people of the Congo as much as we can on the road ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Finally, I would like to recall what Mr. Guéhenno said in his briefing about our being careful not to move towards early disengagement from the Congo, because experience has shown that the results of early disengagement are sometimes not positive at all.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ileka</span> <span class="nation">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa01">Allow me, first of all, to express my pleasure at seeing you, Mr. President, preside over the Security Council for the month of January, as well as to thank you for convening this important meeting of the Council devoted to the European Union-led force (EUFOR) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome the presence among us of Mr. Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union, as well as to express my gratitude for his very thorough briefing. I have also listened closely to the statement made by the representatives of Germany on behalf of the European Union, and those of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Political Affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa02">EUFOR was the second military intervention of the European Union in my country. Operation Artemis in 2003, which included the deployment of the Interim Emergency Multinational Force, managed at the time to stabilize the security and humanitarian situation in Bunia, making it possible to implement the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement on the Transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As others who have spoken before me have pointed out, EUFOR was a military force authorized by the Security Council under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1761(2006).pdf" class="nolink">resolution 1761 (2006)</a>, of 25 April 2006, and deployed by the European Union to support the electoral process on behalf of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC).</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa03">We can say with confidence that EUFOR's record has been largely positive. Elections have been held successfully and the Congolese people have expressed their will in complete freedom, voting in massive numbers in the legislative elections and the two rounds of presidential elections. The transitional period in the Democratic Republic of the Congo came to an end with the inauguration of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, the first Congolese President elected through direct universal suffrage. A Prime Minister has been designated, who is preparing to form the future Government. The National Assembly is being established as we meet, and existing provincial assemblies are preparing to begin their work. Elections for governors and senators are somewhat behind schedule, but they will occur before the end of the month. Other local elections will take place later this year. The structure of the Third Republic is therefore slowly being established. With the success of this undertaking, the United Nations and the European Union have made it possible to establish a truly democratic arena in my country.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa04">The efforts of the European Union are not limited to EUFOR. The European Union is also playing a role through EUSEC, the European Union mission to provide advice and assistance for security sector reform in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and EUPOL, the European Union Police Mission in Kinshasa. With regard to the organization and holding of elections, we should also acknowledge that the European Union is the main supporter of the Independent Electoral Commission. We should also bear in mind that many members of the European Union and its associated States are also providing assistance to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in many areas on the bilateral level, in close cooperation with the United Nations and the European Union. I would like those countries and our international, continental and regional partners to know how very grateful the Congolese people are for their assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa05">However, the human, material and financial resources devoted to my country by the European Union and the United Nations could be for naught as long as there are dictatorial regimes in the Great Lakes region that have little respect for human rights. For its part, the Democratic Republic of the Congo would like to solemnly renew its commitment to participate in the establishment of peace and security for its own people and for those of neighbouring States. The Democratic Republic intends to fully play its role as a central and pivotal State in international efforts aimed at stabilizing the entire Great Lakes region in particular, and Africa in general.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa06">With the establishment of new institutions, the Congolese people rely on the ongoing support of the international community to continue policies aimed at national reconciliation, economic and social recovery and the rebuilding of the country. The future Congolese Government will soon begin discussions with the United Nations as regards the future of their partnership.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa07">Overall, I can assure the Council that the President of the Republic and the Congolese people want the international community to continue its commitment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We call on the international community -- as the High Representative of the European Union and my African colleagues on the Council have done -- to continue to provide assistance, including in support of the new institutions, the reform of the national army and police as part of security sector reform, the continuation of disarmament programmes -- both the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation and the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration programmes, including those pertaining to child soldiers -- judicial sector reform, including human rights, good governance and development, so as to make it possible for the Congolese people to fully benefit from the dividends produced by peace. I am both encouraged and reassured by the renewed commitment of the European Union in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa08">The international community should also continue to help our country to address factors of instability such as the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and illicit arms trafficking in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa09">Before I conclude, I would like to pay well-deserved tribute to the personnel of EUFOR for their professionalism. Through their remarkable work, they have made possible secure elections while at the same time demonstrating full impartiality. EUFOR has also made it possible to return to peace, calm and stability. EUFOR's military personnel returned home on the scheduled date, with the certainty of having accomplished their mission.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa10">I would also like to thank the Governments of the Gabonese Republic and the sisterly Government of Congo-Brazzaville for the steps they took to facilitate the operations of EUFOR.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa11">With the establishment of new democratically elected republican institutions, our country is today beginning a new phase. However, many challenges remain, and they are enormous. It is important that the support of the international community not let up. We have that opportunity. I would also like to reiterate what was said by Mr. Guéhenno that we have an opportunity and a duty not to repeat certain errors of the past, including through a hasty withdrawal by the international community. Rather we should strengthen the partnership that has been established with my country in order to build the momentum with a view to contemplating with much more serenity the future of a Congo that is truly democratic, a spearhead of the African renaissance, where more peace, security, justice and prosperity will prevail.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to Mr. Solana to respond to comments made and questions raised.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Solana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01"> I would like to respond to the two questions posed by the representative of the United Kingdom. I believe that these two questions can be answered very simply with a "yes" to question number one and a "yes" to question number two.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">But I would like to be a little more explicit. It is true that the vocation of the European Union is to act in coordination with others, and that has been our manner of action in general terms. Of course, sometimes we have to act on our own, but generally our vocation is to cooperate with others in any operation. We have done so with the African Union with NATO and with the United Nations, in the first place. To my mind, that is the answer to the first question.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">As for the second question, which is whether the lessons that we have learned from the EUFOR can be applied to other operations, whether in Africa or elsewhere, the answer is also "yes". The structure of force that we ourselves are organizing, as the Ambassador has said, is a concept that is well prepared for this type of rapid, efficient operation that can open a way for others to follow. In any case, I think that good lessons have already been drawn and more will follow in the future. I hope very much that these lessons will be useful in other parts of Africa where there will be much need in the foreseeable future, in particular in Darfur.</p>
