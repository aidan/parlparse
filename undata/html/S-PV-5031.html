	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a briefing by Mr. Heraldo Muñoz, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities. I now give him the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">First of all, allow me to say how gratified I am to have a Spanish speaker, and yourself in particular, Mr. President, presiding over this meeting of the Council on an issue of the greatest importance for the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">This is the second of the oral assessments that I present every 120 days to the Council pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>. As you may recall, I concluded my last briefing by noting that terrorism continues to be a global threat that can be addressed only through the concerted efforts of the international community. I also emphasized that this would be a long struggle. Sadly, recent events have again shown us that the fight against terrorism is far from over. The horrific terrorist attacks against innocent children, women and parents in Beslan, Russia and the bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta a few days ago are tragic reminders that we need to do a lot more to defeat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Today, I want to reiterate that terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security that affect every State. Therefore, we need to consolidate and further enhance the achievements of the United Nations in fighting this scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee is acutely aware of these challenges. As I shall explain in a moment, the Committee is currently considering the first report of its Monitoring Team, which contains recommendations on how to address the constant evolution of the Al Qaeda network. I shall also explain our plans for continuing and improving our cooperation with Member States in order to further strengthen the sanctions regime. Before I do so I will, however, briefly inform you of the activities of the Committee and its Monitoring Team since I gave my last briefing on 25 May 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The legal basis for the Committee's work continues to be <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, which was adopted on 30 January 2004. That resolution not only provides the conceptual framework for the Committee and the Monitoring Team but also addresses the mandatory and other responsibilities of Member States with regard to the sanctions regime imposed against Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">Since 25 May, the Committee has held 11 informal meetings. The Committee has continued its practice of discussing and studying issues in informal settings, as that allows members to exchange their views more freely and to meet as frequently as necessary. Such an environment has proven to be more useful to new representatives on the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">In several meetings held in June, the Committee discussed an informal document presented by the Chairman on non-mandatory measures contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>. In that connection, it was recognized that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a> introduced a number of measures that, although not mandatory, are important for the implementation of the sanctions regime against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as they provide ideas as to how States might further enhance their counter-terrorism efforts. Such efforts could seek to cut the flow of funds and other financial assets to and from individuals and entities on the List. They could also lead to the establishment of internal procedures on the transborder movement of currency, based on applicable thresholds. Other non-mandatory measures seek to further improve the Committee's List and to strengthen cooperation in the area of capacity-building for the implementation of sanctions measures. When considering the non-mandatory measures contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, the Committee realized that some of those measures might become mandatory in the future if deemed appropriate and necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">The Committee spent a considerable amount of time and effort revising the guidelines for the conduct of its work. That was mainly because the existing guidelines do not reflect the most important changes made to the sanctions regime against Al Qaeda by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1455(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1455 (2003)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1526 (2004)</a>. The Committee has therefore focused on adapting its current guidelines to make them better tools with which to rationalize its work and provide guidance to Member States in instances when relevant Security Council provisions do not provide sufficient information or guidance. The Committee has made progress in its efforts to adopt new guidelines and will continue its discussions to reach consensus in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Since 25 May, the names of 8 new individuals and 6 new entities have been placed on the Committee's List. In order to implement the requirements of paragraph 19 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, and in line with the practice of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), a list of contact points has been established. That list enables the Committee's secretariat to inform the relevant officials of Member States of any changes to the List as soon as they are made. That contact list is already fully operational and contains contact points in all permanent missions and in 183 States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">The Committee has continued to deal expeditiously with exceptions, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1452(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1452 (2002)</a>. In conformity with the list of notifying States maintained by the Committee, 11 States have so far approached the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">We have established an active working relationship with the Chairman of the CTC and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Director, and we agree that cooperation between the two Committees needs to be strengthened further. To that end, a meeting will be held this week with the participation of the CTC Chairman, myself and the CTC experts and their Executive Director, as well as with the Monitoring Team of the Al Qaeda-Taliban sanctions Committee and its coordinator.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">During the past four months the Monitoring Team has focused on establishing a close and effective working relationship with the Committee and Member States. The Team has established a number of contacts both with permanent missions in New York and with relevant national authorities. It has also provided the Committee with support in promoting the effective implementation of relevant resolutions and assessing the impact of the measures detailed in those resolutions, and by making recommendations as to how those measures might be made more effective. It has also produced a report for the Committee on those States that have not fulfilled their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1455(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1455 (2003)</a> by the agreed deadline. In addition, the Team has provided support to the Chairman of the Committee, in particular during his travel to selected countries. It has also established a close working relationship with the CTC, including in particular with CTC experts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">The Team has approached the work on the Committee's List actively and has focused on how further improvements might be made to the List. It has sent letters to 80 States seeking additional information on those entries where identifying information is missing or is not satisfactory. It has also encouraged Member States to add names to the List and has received a very positive response.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">The Team has undertaken several trips. Between 6 and 27 July it visited Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt and the United Kingdom. The purpose of those visits was to assess the evolution of the threat posed by Al Qaeda, to seek suggestions on how to improve the List, to discuss ideas for making sanctions more effective and to encourage States to add names to the Committee's List. In August, members of the Team visited Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the capital of the United States, Washington. Members of the Team have also made presentations on their work and that of the Committee to regional meetings in Asia and Africa. On each of its trips the Team was well received and noted great interest in engaging further with the Committee as a necessary step in strengthening international cooperation in the global effort to counter terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">The Committee highly appreciates the information provided by the Monitoring Team on the outcome of its visits to selected States shortly after their return. Those briefings enhance the Committee's understanding of the concerns and experiences of visited States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">On 31 July, the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team submitted its first written report to the sanctions Committee. In paragraph 8 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, the Security Council requested the Monitoring Team to submit three written reports to the Committee during its eighteen-month mandate, with the first report due before the end of July. I publicly commend the Monitoring Team for having met its deadline and for having produced a concise, well-conceived and high-quality document. The report contains fresh ideas and will give a new impetus to the work of the sanctions Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">It should be recalled that the Monitoring Team was established to assist the Al Qaeda and Taliban Committee in better fulfilling its mandate. It consists of independent experts and its findings and recommendations are thus independent. The Committee has already begun studying the report and will consider any measure that may be taken to further enhance its work. It is the Committee's responsibility to consider the Team's report carefully and to reach its own conclusions regarding appropriate follow-up action that might be taken either by the Committee itself or at the level of the Security Council. The Committee is undertaking a thorough consideration of the recommendations contained in the report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">The Committee first discussed the report at its informal meeting on 23 August, when it decided to release the report to the public. I then forwarded the report to the President of the Security Council via a letter dated 23 August and it was issued as an official document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-2004-679.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/679</a>. On 30 August, I held a joint press conference with the Coordinator of the Monitoring Team, Mr. Richard Barrett -- who is with us today -- at which we introduced the report to the media.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">As the report is the Monitoring Team's first, it sets the stage for the Team's subsequent work. It lays out the background for the Team's future findings, summarizes the activities undertaken to date and describes how it intends to proceed with its work in future. The report also provides an indication of the potential recommendations the Team is minded to make in its subsequent reports. Of particular interest is the fact that the Team has foreshadowed a number of measures that might be taken to improve the functionality and credibility of the Consolidated List, as well as to strengthen the effectiveness of the existing financial sanctions, arms embargo and travel ban.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">I do not intend to go into the details of the report here. It is very well written and speaks for itself. However, one theme that the Monitoring Team emphasizes in it is that the international community cannot afford to rest on its laurels at this crucial juncture in the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. It also stressed the need to encourage closer operational cooperation between States to make the international environment still more inhospitable to Al Qaeda-related terrorism, to the collection and distribution of funds and to access to the weapons used in terrorist attacks. It is unfortunate that this key message has been misinterpreted in certain media reports as a failure of the sanctions regime.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">The Team notes that the nature of the threat from Al Qaeda and the Taliban is constantly evolving, just as Al Qaeda itself has evolved from an organization with a structure and hierarchy into a global network of groups unbound by organizational structure but held together by a set of overlapping ideological goals. Therefore, the international community must respond creatively and effectively to the changing threat posed by Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The Security Council should be vigilant in ensuring that its strategy to counter the Al Qaeda threat is as good as it can be. We must try to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa22">Continued cooperation with member States remains perhaps the most important aspect of the Committee's work. Three issues merit specific attention: the need to further improve the quality of the Committee's List; the opportunity, provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, for States to meet with the Committee; and the visits I undertake with members of the Committee to selected States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa23">As I just mentioned, one of the central themes of the report of the Monitoring Team is the need to improve and develop the Committee's List further. The Committee is considering adopting several of the recommendations included in the report. In this regard, I would like to encourage in the strongest possible terms all member States to cooperate with the Committee in submitting new names to the Committee's List. The List currently holds the names of 429 individuals and entities belonging to or associated with Al Qaeda and/or the Taliban.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa24">As we all know, that is, sadly, only a small fraction of the actual number of individuals and entities which are in fact associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1526 (2004)</a> reiterated the importance of proposing such names to the Committee, unless to do so would compromise investigations or enforcement actions. I understand that there can be many reasons for not submitting names to the Committee, including concerns regarding due process, the delisting of certain names and the potential stigmatization of listed persons. I strongly believe, however, that Member States and the Committee can resolve such concerns together. The Committee will ask the Monitoring Team to explore the reasons for non-submission of names. It should, of course, be noted that the names of Al Qaeda and Taliban members are mostly unknown and such individuals are difficult to identify unless they are caught preparing or committing terrorist acts or while providing assistance to those belonging to or associated with the Al Qaeda network.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa25">The Committee is aware that it has work to do with regard to refining its List. The Committee will ask the Monitoring Team to submit to it a list of practical and achievable technical corrections and I will encourage Member States to inform the Committee should they have technical corrections. Soon the Committee will also consider the status of deceased individuals and how best to deal with such situations regarding the Committee's List to ensure that their assets do not fall into the hands of terrorists. In its work, the Committee will continue to give due consideration to the fact that sanctions implementation, including in the context of delisting procedures, must take place in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa26">The need for further cooperation between the Committee and Member States is emphasized in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, which provides States with an opportunity, at the Committee's request, to send representatives to meet with the Committee for more in-depth discussion of relevant issues. I fear that this rather cryptic language may have caused some uncertainty regarding who should take the initiative: the State, which has been provided with an opportunity, or the Committee, which makes the request? Unfortunately, the result has been that no such meetings have been held. I should like to take this opportunity to invite all interested States that may wish to meet in such a manner with the Committee to do so. I should also stress that the purpose of such meetings will be to learn more about member States experiences and concerns and to explore ways to improve the sanctions regime. I should also note that several member States participated in Committee meetings last year, under the previous resolution, and that was a very productive exercise which we will seek to repeat.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa27">As I shall detail shortly, I plan to undertake further visits to Member States as requested by the Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>. I find that these visits are an invaluable tool in improving cooperation between the Committee and Member States. My previous visits have helped the Committee focus on issues of concern to States and have highlighted new trends and methods used by Al Qaeda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa28">With the support of the Monitoring Team and in close cooperation with the CTC, the Committee intends to consolidate and promote the achievements of the United Nations in the fight against terrorism. In that regard, the Committee aims to work diligently to fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council. Therefore, it will continue to explore how it can motivate States to fulfil their obligations to implement the measures against Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa29">The Committee and its members understand that international terrorism poses a long-term challenge to the whole world and to each country individually. And international terrorists are swiftly adapting their strategies, tactics and methods, as we have witnessed in the last few months. For that reason, the sanctions tool must be not only a powerful and well-targeted one, but it must also be implementable. The sanctions regime should, therefore, be carefully monitored on a regular basis and adjusted accordingly, as necessary. The Committee, with the assistance of the Team, is currently exploring how to improve the implementation of the existing sanctions measures, or even, eventually, adopting new ones.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa30">One thing is absolutely certain in this endeavour being undertaken by the international community and individual States: there are no quick fixes, short-cuts or easy remedies. Rather, the task requires systematic, persistent and exacting work, accompanied by constant analysis of what has been carried out and responding to the following questions: "Are we moving in the right direction? Do we have sufficient clarity on how to proceed? Have we made mistakes? Have we learned from our mistakes?" If we do not ask ourselves these questions, I fear that the terrorists associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban will, and will take pertinent steps.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa31">That said, I would like to highlight some concrete tasks before the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa32">First, there is a need to further improve the quality of the List. The List -- although imperfect -- already plays a very important deterrent role, but its completeness and accuracy are essential for the success of the sanctions already established. As I said earlier, the Committee relies on the assistance of Member States to improve the List.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa33">Secondly, there is a need to focus more closely, through the activities of the Monitoring Team, on the results of States' sanctions enforcement activities, with a view to detecting problems faced by States in implementing them. The case studies to be conducted by the Monitoring Team should prove invaluable in that respect. The Committee and its Monitoring Team stress that States should not feel that their international prestige or good reputation will be undermined by acknowledging problems in their implementation efforts or by having been exposed to terrorist activities on their territory. The fact is that no country in the world can consider itself immune to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa34">Thirdly, the Committee's work in the area of delisting and exceptions pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1452(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1452 (2002)</a> needs to be boosted. It is likely that States would be more forthcoming in submitting the names of individuals and entities for addition to the List if they were sure that there was a reliable mechanism to correct possible mistakes or to provide for necessary basic expenses for the persons included on the List.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa35">Fourthly, travel by the Chairman and by members of the Security Council, the Committee and the Monitoring Team must continue to receive support. While much useful work can be done in New York, in order to be effective the fight against terrorism requires constant evaluation of how sanctions measures are being applied on the ground. Based on my own experience, which includes visits to more than a dozen countries, I am convinced that without continuous monitoring on the ground, our efforts will be fruitless. Visits to the countries help us learn. In the near future I am planning to visit several important countries in Asia, and I will be travelling to Central Asia and Europe in November. The Monitoring Team will be travelling to Africa, Europe and Asia in order to promote their work and seek the cooperation of Member States for the studies they will undertake.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa36">Fifthly, it is necessary to listen more attentively to you, the Member States, and to provide the opportunity to share your views and concerns, so that you can receive the needed assistance. In that connection, the written assessment of the reports submitted to the Committee by over 130 States pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1455(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1455 (2003)</a> will be completed in the next 120-day period.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa37">Sixthly, there is a need to increase cooperation and coordination: with the CTC and its Executive Directorate, in line with the meetings already held and planned for the very near future; with the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>; and with all international agencies or organizations that have accumulated experience and specialized expertise in the fight against terrorism. Some States have already come to realize how important it is to coordinate their efforts at the national level to combat terrorism. It is doubly important to do so at the international level. What is needed is a coordinated approach involving all participants in the fight against terrorism, while fully respecting their distinctive mandates.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa38">It is clear that the Committee will have a busy time ahead in its efforts to adapt the sanctions to better target Al Qaeda and the Taliban. In this effort there is a need to think of new ways to defeat terrorism and its perpetrators. I know that I will have the full support of the Committee in this task, and I urge all other Member States to also assist us in this vital undertaking. As I have already explained, this assistance can be given both by submitting new names for inclusion in the List and by meeting with the Committee to share experiences and ideas on what issues we need to consider and how sanctions can be developed and improved.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa39">I look forward to the dialogue I will have with Member States in my upcoming travels and also to hearing from the Monitoring Team on the experiences during their visits. It is my firm belief that when I give my next 120-day report to the Council I will be able to draw on the lessons learned from my travels, from the Monitoring Team's next report and from the meetings that I hope will take place between the Committee and interested Member States in the interim.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa40">The continued fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban is of the utmost importance. I trust we never hesitate, never pause, never remain satisfied with what we have accomplished and that we never falter. The Committee's work will continue to be guided by this principle in order to contribute to a more peaceful, secure and cooperative world community.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Muñoz for the ample information he has provided and for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">I will now call on the members of the Council who wish to speak.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Holliday</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">Ambassador Muñoz has provided us with a very helpful, informative and specific overview of the recent work of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> and the important contribution that the Monitoring Team has made in support of those efforts. Recent events, particularly in the Russian Federation and affecting Australian citizens in Indonesia, serve as a sad and sobering reminder that the global threat of terrorism persists. The Monitoring Team's 31 July report correctly notes that the international community has made important progress in combating the threat posed by terrorists associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. We and our allies have weakened Al Qaeda's ability to launch new operations by freezing more than $140 million in assets linked to many individuals and entities affiliated with the Al Qaeda network and other terrorist groups. The freezing of terrorist assets remains a top United States Government priority. We strongly encourage those nations that have not already done so to enact domestic legislation to permit the freezing of terrorist-linked assets.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The Monitoring Team's report also noted that individual Member States cooperate more closely than ever in sharing information and mounting joint efforts to defeat our terrorist enemies. That cooperation remains essential to ensure full sanctions implementation by all States.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">We must continue to set the bar high in our shared fight against Al Qaeda. We need fresh and imaginative ideas to defeat our terrorist foes, particularly as they formulate new strategies to undermine international peace and security. The Monitoring Team's report appropriately notes that the nature of the Al Qaeda and Taliban threat has evolved since the Security Council first imposed measures against the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. Al Qaeda has become a global network of groups, no longer bound to one nation's borders, that pose a threat to all freedom-loving peoples around the globe. We need to ensure that we continue to refine and tailor existing measures and consider additional steps that may be needed to address the constant evaluation of the Al Qaeda and Taliban threat.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">In closing, Sir, I would like to commend Ambassador Muñoz and his delegation for their vigorous and expert leadership of a Security Council Committee that has become a critical focal point for our shared efforts to combat terrorism. The United States delegation also welcomes the efforts of the new Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, led by coordinator Richard Barrett, in support of the work of the Committee. We will draw heavily on its expertise to provide ideas on how States might further enhance their counter-terrorism efforts. In that regard, I am pleased to note that two members of the team recently visited Washington, D.C., to meet with senior counter-terrorism officials from my Government. The United States Government stands ready to assist the Council's efforts against the threat posed by Al Qaeda and we will provide leadership where necessary. It is a fight none of us can afford to lose. Our efforts must be tireless.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">The United Kingdom fully associates itself with the statement soon to be made by the Dutch Ambassador on behalf of the European Union and the acceding States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">As recent events have shown, the threat of terrorist attack is ever present. The United Kingdom Government has already offered its condolences to the people of Russia and Indonesia. Such attacks underline again the need for the international community to do everything possible to prevent future attacks. That is why the briefing of Ambassador Muñoz today is so important, as is his personal commitment and efforts on behalf of the Committee. His visits to Member States have been particularly important. They provided opportunities to discuss the importance of sanctions, to promote the work of the Committee and to find out how sanctions are being implemented at an operational level. This has been key to raising the international profile of the sanctions and the work of the Committee. Ambassador Muñoz will have the fullest support of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">I welcome the Al Qaeda and Taliban Monitoring Team's report which identifies the changing nature of the threat from Al Qaeda and the Taliban. That report has inspired the Committee, both by making practical recommendations on implementation and by providing new insights into issues which have proved contentious for the Committee in the past. We cannot shy away from such issues and the Monitoring Team's report and recommendations have already stimulated discussion and provided a basis on which to focus debate. We must move that discussion forward now. The United Kingdom fully supports the future activities supported by the Chairman of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">I would like to touch on two points which seem particularly key to the success of the sanctions and of the Committee. First, here is the Consolidated List. It is not a List for use by the Security Council or the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee alone. The List belongs to each and every Member State. Every State must be encouraged to take ownership of that List. One of the most important ways to do so is by submitting names for inclusion on that List, where there are names that should be provided.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">It may be, as the Chairman has inferred, that some States have refrained from submitting names because they are unsure how to do so, or they believe there is a stigma attached to admitting that there may be Al Qaeda or Taliban associates in their country. But as Ambassador Muñoz argued, we should all do everything possible to combat that perception. The threat from Al Qaeda is common to many States, and submitting names of its associates demonstrates a State's clear mutual commitment to fighting terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">Secondly, I would like to speak broadly about cooperation, whether between States to facilitate implementation between regional organizations or experts, or on a national domestic level. Cooperation is crucial to the success of the sanctions and the fight against terrorism. Therefore, the recommendations of the Al Qaeda Committee and the Monitoring Team are very welcome, but there should be closer cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and its executive directorate. In particular, I welcome the way Ambassador Muñoz emphasized that point. The work of the sister committees are key priorities which merit the substantial consideration of the Council. Each has much to gain from the other.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">Another welcome recommendation from the Monitoring Team is that information on the list should be shared with national intelligence agencies and financial institutions -- partners in our effort to combat terrorism and crucial to ensuring our rapid reaction to new entries on the List. We tried to do this in the United Kingdom and the value seems evident. Recent statistics show us that the information drawn from the Consolidated List and placed on the Bank of England's web site is now getting something on the order of 50,000 hits per month. Sharing such information is pivotal.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">Today's discussion is another stage in the international community's response to the fight against terrorism. Much is being achieved, but the lessons of recent events underline the need for us all to redouble our efforts. Protection against the scourge of terrorism in all its aspects is one of the key challenges for the United Nations and all its Member States, as well as for all the other regional organizations that also have vital contributions to make. We have to live up to that challenge.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I would like to join other delegations in expressing our gratitude to Ambassador Muñoz, Chairman of the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee, for his second 120-day briefing under paragraph 12 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1526 (2004)</a>. We also thank the Al Qaeda and Taliban Monitoring Team for their first six-month report under resolution 1526.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Our meeting today closely follows the third anniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001, which shocked the entire world and evoked universal condemnation. The recent terrorist attack on innocent school children and their parents in Beslan was a gruesome reminder of the continuation of this threat. We extend our profound condolences to the victims and to the Government of the Russian Federation. Last week's bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta is but the latest reminder of our vulnerabilities to globalized terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Terrorism, whether perpetrated by individuals, groups or States, poses an ever-present threat to many countries. Today, it also threatens Pakistan's vital national interests. We have therefore participated actively in the global campaign against terrorism. We have led the way in capturing the majority of the leadership of Al Qaeda and over 500 terrorists. Our campaign is ongoing on the Afghan-Pakistan border, in bilateral cooperation with the major Powers and within the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Our success against the terrorists has, naturally, attracted increased terrorist attacks, including against our President and Prime Minister. The Monitoring Team of the 1267 Committee, which visited Pakistan in July, noted in its report the convincing demonstration of our determination to fight the terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">It would be simplistic to expect the Security Council's sanctions regimes alone to eliminate the threat of terrorism. The campaign against terrorism must be pursued with full comprehension of the threat and with a clear strategy for success.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">We have noted the work done by the Committee during the past four months. We have also noted the recommendations of the Monitoring Team. We will continue to work closely with the Committee and the Team in their efforts to improve the sanctions.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">I have a few comments to make about the work of the Committee and the Monitoring Team. First, we share the Chairman's view that the completeness and accuracy of the Consolidated List is essential for the success of sanctions. This would also help States in prosecuting or extraditing listed individuals and entities.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">Second, the Committee should continue to further improve the delisting procedures and address due process concerns. Third, the implementation of financial sanctions should not unduly target Islamic charities or discourage people from making contributions for charitable purposes, which is an Islamic obligation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">Fourth, the Committee should use the term "associates" carefully. Expansive interpretation of that term to target diverse terrorists as being linked to Al Qaeda runs the risk of diluting the focus of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">Fifth, visits to States by the Committee Chairman and the Monitoring Team should be used to foster cooperation through facilitation of the provision of technical assistance and constructive dialogue. We hope that post-visit briefings and reports will continue to be made on a regular basis. These have been useful in enhancing the Committee's understanding and in promoting transparency.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa11">Sixth, the Committee's efforts to cooperate with other United Nations bodies should be pursued, as pointed out by the Chairman today, while fully respecting their distinctive mandates. Seventh, we have noted the Monitoring Team's concerns regarding the threat of Al Qaeda's constructing bombs that disperse a chemical, biological or radiological pollutant or making a dirty bomb or other weapons of mass casualties. We believe that there is a need for a realistic evaluation of that threat, which should not divert the Committee from fulfilling its central mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa12">The threats of terrorism by weapons of mass destruction can and should be addressed through steps under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> of the Council, as well as through the faithful implementation and improvement of existing international regimes dealing with weapons of mass destruction issues.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa13">We believe that the Committee also needs to adopt a discerning approach in dealing with the Taliban, bearing in mind the political and security realities in Afghanistan and the policies of President Karzai's Government.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa14">Terrorism continues to be a global threat requiring a coordinated international response. Paragraph 2 of the Monitoring Team report indicates that Al Qaeda has evolved into "a global network of groups unbound by ... structure but held together by a set of overlapping" ideological goals. It appears from the report that that evolving network generally avoids using conventional means of finance, travel or arms acquisition. That underscores the need for a matching response to prevent future terrorist attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa15">Global cooperation against terrorism has been highly successful. Determined and collective action has contained and destroyed the violent agendas of the terrorists. The immediate anti-terrorist response must, however, be accompanied by a clear, long-term strategy for success in ensuring an end to this murderous tactic. Such a strategy must include the following elements.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa16">First, there must be consensus on a definition of terrorism. Secondly, the terrorists' cause must be delegitimized by addressing issues such as foreign occupation, the denial of self-determination, military intervention and the use of force. Thirdly, broader structural issues must be addressed, including political and economic injustice. Fourthly, we must ensure that counter-terrorism does not violate fundamental human rights or provoke a clash of cultures.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa17">Attempts to identify terrorism with Islam are both unfair and counterproductive. They defame our sacred and peace-loving faith; unwittingly they accord terrorists an ideological respectability they do not deserve; and they intensify hostility. They weaken those who propagate moderation and cooperation. In this context, we would urge consideration of the strategy of enlightened moderation proposed by President Musharraf of Pakistan.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa18">We agree with the Chairman that we need to do a lot more to defeat terrorism. The Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee and the Security Council can reinforce and coordinate, but they cannot substitute for national and regional actions. The success of the Committee hinges on the cooperation it receives from States, as well as on the comprehensiveness and clarity of our response to the terrorist threat.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baja</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">My delegation, too, welcomes this public meeting today, which gave us the opportunity once again to listen as our colleague, Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, Chairman of the sanctions Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban, provided us with a comprehensive briefing on what is being done by the Committee, as well as on its future plans in addressing international terrorism -- one of the serious global concerns that spares no country or individual, as recent events in the Russian Federation and Indonesia have shown. My delegation commends the efforts and the activities of the Committee, as highlighted by the personal commitment of Ambassador Muñoz in addressing the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">We also welcome the very informative report submitted to the Committee and the Security Council by the new Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>. It is important to look closely at the recommendations that it has put forward based on its analysis of the national reports, which have increased to 130 submissions, thanks to the combined efforts of the Committee and the Monitoring Team. We now have a broader and more comprehensive basis from which to draw patterns, trends and conclusions to further strengthen the sanctions regime against Al Qaeda and terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">We also note the caveat expressed by both the Chairman and the Monitoring Team report that there is a lot more work to be done because of the mutations in how the Al Qaeda terrorists are organized and operate, which the Monitoring Team terms "current Al Qaeda methodology".</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">The Council should take note of the information from Ambassador Muñoz that Al Qaeda is currently a global network rather than an organization with a structure and a hierarchy. Al Qaeda no longer needs large sums of money to mount terror attacks, and consequently it is able to finance such actions in less detectable ways. Among the difficult-to-scrutinize financing sources are proceeds from crime; diversions from charitable donations, even inheritance sums; counterfeit-currency trading; credit-card fraud; the drug trade; and even an ancient financial system by which many brokers can move cash from one office to another based on trust.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">Al Qaeda has become more flexible in staying ahead of sanctions. We therefore support Ambassador Muñoz's observation on the need to strengthen the sanctions regime that the Council has been implementing. That has become urgent as Al Qaeda has decentralized into loose networks of affiliated groups with the capacity to inspire terror attacks through means not currently proscribed. In that connection, submissions to the Council -- particularly the Lists -- should be accurate and sufficiently detailed to be useful. The suggestions just made by Ambassador Muñoz deserve the Council's most serious consideration; we fully support them.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">We also welcome the very informative reports submitted to the Committee and to the Security Council by the sanctions regime. It is important to immediately establish identifiable patterns through intelligence and to adopt effective measures to deter the plans of Al Qaeda. That should be a conscious objective underlying all global counter-terrorism efforts. International cooperation on all fronts -- multilateral, regional and bilateral -- can complement everyone's efforts and can have multiplier effects.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">We also welcome the continuing collaboration and coordination of the 1267 Committee with the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). In that regard, my delegation fully supports the visits on the ground being conducted both by the Chairman and by the Monitoring Team, as they provide practical insights on evolving Al Qaeda operations, on specific problem areas encountered by States in implementing the sanctions regime and on what measures can be adopted to enhance international cooperation and to support national efforts in countering Al Qaeda operations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The Philippines welcomed the recent visit of the Monitoring Team to Manila and to other capitals in our region, where a forthright exchange of experiences with the operational implementing agencies resulted in valuable information for further strengthening national and international efforts against terrorism. The Philippines stands fully committed in the global fight against terrorism and will continue to share its experiences in further refining measures against the emerging new methodologies of Al Qaeda.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I wish to join others in thanking Ambassador Muñoz for his highly informative oral report, which we fully support. I would also like to welcome the presence of Mr. Richard Barrett, the Coordinator of the Monitoring Team, and to express our appreciation for the comprehensive and lucid report prepared by the Team.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">As Romania aligns itself with the statement to be delivered shortly by Ambassador van den Berg of the Netherlands on behalf of the European Union, I shall confine myself to a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">We should focus the assessment of the work of our Committee around the worrisome conclusions drawn by the Monitoring Team and highlighted in Ambassador's Muñoz's report, according to which the threat from Al Qaeda-related terrorism remains as great as ever. Al Qaeda, although significantly affected by the decisive actions taken against it by the international community, not only has survived but also has continued to engage in criminal, indiscriminate attacks around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">Today we are deliberating in the looming shadow of the commemoration of the third anniversary of the attacks of 11 September 2001. The grief of so many bereaved families, the shock of a nation and the distinct feeling that the camp of the peace-loving has deadly enemies are all very much present with us today. Indeed, the United Nations and the Security Council have come a long way in the three years that have elapsed in helping the international community to strengthen and organize its response to modern-day terror. The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities, and those who have chaired or served them as members or supporters deserve our limitless praise for that.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">However, there is much more to accomplish and much more to be learned from the experience so far gained at the level of the Security Council and much more to be acted upon in addressing identified gaps or shortcomings. Reviewing our progress and adjusting our response to the evolving menace with which we are confronted are constant imperatives and permanent challenges. And herein, I believe, lies the main reason why I can safely say that Ambassador Muñoz and his 1267 Committee fully live up to the high expectations placed on them.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">As the Security Council assumes a leading role in the fight against terrorism and Al Qaeda, it must constantly reconfirm its ability to deliver on its responsibilities under the United Nations Charter. Effectiveness, cooperation and assistance are the key parameters of that complex undertaking. Given the changes in the nature of the threat posed by Al Qaeda, effectiveness means continuous adaptation on the part of the Council and the 1267 Committee to those changes, including by constantly refining the sanctions regime and by ensuring its proper and full implementation. Romania, in its capacity as Vice-Chair of the Committee, stands ready to actively participate in efforts to identify the most appropriate solutions in that respect. It is in that context that we would like to express, on a preliminary basis, our appreciation for the set of recommendations put forward by the Monitoring Team, which are currently under scrutiny by the members of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">Al Qaeda's target is the international community as a whole, and the threat represented by Al Qaeda is therefore global. As the past year's attacks have demonstrated, no country in the world is immune any longer to terrorism. Terrorism strikes indiscriminately from New York to Madrid and Bali and from Moscow to Istanbul and Beslan. Effectively combating this scourge -- in particular the acts committed by this gruesome terrorist network -- requires a global response and active participation by all United Nations Members.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">Full cooperation by Member States in strictly implementing the sanctions imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a> must be supplemented by close cooperation among the 1267 Committee and other subsidiary bodies of the Security Council -- in particular the CTC, its newly established Executive Directorate and the Committee established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, as well as other relevant international agencies and organizations. In welcoming the progress in strengthening the cooperation between the 1267 Committee and the CTC, I would like to assure Ambassador Muñoz of my entire readiness to discuss, in my capacity as Chairman of the 1540 Committee, possible synergies among our Committees.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">As stated repeatedly within the Council, in fighting terrorism, the international community is as strong as its weakest link. It is therefore in the global interest to ensure that every single Member of the United Nations is able and willing to put in place all the necessary measures for effectively combating this scourge. In order to achieve that goal, it is therefore vital that assistance be provided to the most vulnerable countries, including by continuing the practice of on-site visits.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">Finally, I would like to extend Romania's deepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the people and Governments of Indonesia and Australia and to the families of the victims of the most recent outrageous terrorist attack committed on 9 September against the Australian embassy in Jakarta. This is, sadly, yet another proof of the fact that the fight against terrorism is far from over and that it has to remain a top priority of the Security Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Denisov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">At the outset, given the theme of today's meeting, let me thank all those who have responded to the latest terrorist attacks against Russia, particularly the tragedy of unprecedented magnitude in the Russian city of Beslan.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">The Security Council adopted, on 1 September, a presidential statement condemning the recent terrorist acts in Russia and appealing for increased international efforts at a time when terrorists have launched a global war. Today, two days after the anniversary of the tragedy of 11 September, it is clear to all that the war on international terrorism is far from completion. The most recent reminder of this was the terrorist attack against the Australian embassy in Jakarta.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">It is important that the international community has responded as a united front and has demonstrated effective solidarity in this fight against terrorism. A serious role in consolidating Member States' counter-terrorist efforts must be played by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and Associated Individuals and Entities. In the last four months, the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee has continued to take an active role in ensuring the effectiveness of the restrictive measures imposed by the Security Council against the Taliban, Al Qaeda and their accomplices. We are pleased to note that the Consolidated List of the Committee has been supplemented in this period of time with new names and information essential to ensuring the appropriate identification of terrorists. Considerable progress has been made in adapting the procedures of this body's work to the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1455(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1455 (2003)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1526 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The groundwork has been laid for genuine cooperation between the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). Contacts and efforts to enhance coordination of the activities of both these committees are under way, both at the level of the Chairs and at the level of expert groups. As the current Chair of the CTC, we would like to reaffirm our fundamental intent to accelerate the pace of such cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Solid support for the efforts of the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee in the implementation of its mandate is provided by the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, which has recently provided its first report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-679.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/679</a>), containing an assessment of the impact of the sanctions regime. We share the majority of the conclusions and recommendations of this report. We note that the assessments of the team with respect to the scope of the threat that continues to be posed at this juncture by the Taliban and Al Qaeda to the international community and to security fully coincides with our own conclusions and recommendations. In particular, we agree with the fact that the leaders of the Taliban and Al Qaeda continue to maintain close contacts with each other. We are also certain that, were the Taliban to acquire control of at least a portion of the territory of Afghanistan, one could soon anticipate the emergence there of new bases of international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">We support the view of the Monitoring Team that, in the near future, the Security Council needs to give additional clarifications with respect to the scope of the arms embargo and the travel ban. Currently, the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a> do allow for varying interpretations of these elements of the sanctions regime, thereby reducing the effectiveness of relevant measures. More precise and comprehensive indications to this end are meant to tangibly ease the task of Member States in appropriately complying with these bans.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, let me again underscore that success in the fight against terrorism depends directly on the unity of the efforts of the entire international community. In this context, we believe it is important to build a dialogue of trust between Member States and the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee on all aspects of the sanctions issue.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">One key tool in the sanctions regime is the Committee's Consolidated List. We have had occasion to hear considerable complaints with respect to the completeness and accuracy of the information contained therein. One can discuss the flaws of the List at great length, but complaints will not help the matter. The Committee clearly does need support from Member States, and we call on Member States to provide such support, including through the submission of additional information to enhance the effectiveness of the contents of the List.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and Associated Individuals and Entities, Ambassador Muñoz, as others have already done, for his comprehensive briefing, for his personal commitment and for his very hard work. We also thank the Monitoring Team for their instructive report.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">As Germany fully subscribes to the forthcoming statement by the presidency of the European Union, I can limit my intervention to the following three points.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">First, the sanctions regime needs and deserves the active support of all United Nations Member States. The terrorist threat remains imminent on a global scale, as the most recent attacks in Jakarta and Beslan tragically demonstrated. Let me again express Germany's sincere condolences to all the victims and their families, and to the Governments of Indonesia, Australia and Russia.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">As all States are targeted by such heinous crimes, all bear a common responsibility to act. The Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions regime is an essential legal and logistical framework for such action, and it is, in our view, a successful one. Although the amount of assets frozen and the number of targeted individuals stopped at border crossings may be limited, the preventive effect of the measures should not be underestimated.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">My second point concerns the Consolidated List. Completing and updating the List is essential. The sanctions regime is far from perfect. Its central tool is the Consolidated List. We share the view of the Monitoring Team that the List needs to be constantly completed and updated with the assistance of Member States. The List can only be as good as the data provided by States. Germany has identified a number of individuals for inclusion on the List. In every case, we have provided extensive identification data and well-documented information about their criminal background, including their link to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The revised guidelines for the Committee's work, which we hope will soon be finalized, are intended to further facilitate close interaction between Member States, the Committee and the Monitoring Team.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">My final remark concerns delisting. The issue of delisting is of growing importance, in particular as regards justly listed individuals who later turned their backs on terrorism. Listing and delisting are two sides of the same coin. We are convinced that if an individual's name must be put on the sanctions List on account of his terrorist crimes and links, his name must, following the same logic, be removed from the List if and when he credibly and durably changes his life and firmly rejects all such terrorist actions and affiliations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">Such delisting is, on the one hand, an issue of material justice and due process in relation to the individual concerned. It is, at the same time, an issue pertaining to the clarity and correctness of the List itself. Moreover, the prospect of being delisted can be an important incentive for the individual concerned to cooperate with counter-terrorism investigations. That positive potential of the sanctions regime deserves careful consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">We therefore welcome the Monitoring Team's intention to review current delisting procedures and to develop proposals for their clarification and transparency. We are convinced that all that will enhance the credibility of the sanctions regime and improve proactive cooperation of States with the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, I would like to underline Germany's determination to continue to interact closely with the Committee and with all concerned, with a view to further improving this important instrument for countering terrorism worldwide.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Duclos</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I wish to thank the President for having convened today's meeting on a topic of great concern to the international community. I also wish to express my appreciation to Ambassador Muñoz for his very clear and precise briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">I would like to associate myself in advance with the statement to be made by the Permanent Representative of the Netherlands on behalf of the presidency of the European Union. I shall therefore confine myself to a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">I must first note that this debate is taking place approximately three years after the deplorable events of 11 September. Unfortunately, since then we have become more familiar with the face of modern terrorism, which is not an American nightmare but, rather, a real threat affecting all the continents of the world. We therefore stand by the victims and, at the moment, our collective thoughts are with the victims of the events in the Caucuses and at the Australian embassy in Jakarta. We once again extend our condolences to the bereaved families of those events.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">Terrorism affects the entire international community. It calls for an extremely energetic response that is without weakness and that takes into account the complexity of the phenomenon. That response must also be based on unity within the international community. In that regard, one important contribution made by the work of Ambassador Muñoz and the Monitoring Team has been to provide a clear, convincing and well-argued analysis of the changing threat posed by the Al Qaeda network and the Taliban. That threat has undoubtedly been, to a certain extent, contained and weakened by the forceful response of the international community. At the same time, however, it is also a threat that has survived and evolved into a new, more diffuse form that is, in some respects, more difficult to combat. How, then, should the work of the Committee established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> proceed? I believe that we should take three courses of action.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">First, we must adapt our instruments -- and in particular the instrument of sanctions -- to the changing nature of the threat. The Monitoring Team has rightly argued for maintaining sanctions in an adapted form as a result of its identification of a number of gaps. It has therefore proposed specific measures to bridge those gaps, including through better coordination and cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). The Al Qaeda Committee has begun to consider those recommendations. For our part, we are fully resolved to engage in that consideration in the most constructive spirit possible.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">The second course of action pertains to the need to strengthen the cohesiveness of the international community. In that regard, we support the proposal of Ambassador Muñoz to intensify contacts with Member States in New York, as well as in the course of visits to the countries concerned, in order to explain the efforts of the Committee, propose assistance where possible and remind countries of the cooperation that is expected, which is sometimes lacking. It is especially necessary that all Member States cooperate in order to provide better and more precise information with regard to individuals on the List.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">The third, and final, course of action pertains to respect for the rule of law, to which the Secretary-General referred last Wednesday in Mexico. He stated that we must find measures to combat terrorism in an effective manner, but that we must also ensure that those methods do not undermine the rule of law and the fundamental rights of citizens. In pursuing our constructive efforts in the Al Qaeda Committee, my delegation will remain vigilant in order to ensure that the principle of effectiveness and respect for the rule of law are both complied with.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Guangya</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank Ambassador Muñoz for his very comprehensive briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The day before yesterday marked the third anniversary of the attacks of 11 September. While we mourn the victims deeply, we also believe that it is necessary to look into more effective ways and means to further cooperation in our fight against terrorism. Much has been achieved in that fight in the last three years. The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> have made very important contributions in that fight. However, the specter of terrorism continues to threaten international peace and security. The recent terrorist attack against Chinese construction workers, the explosion at the Moscow subway station, the hostage-taking event in Beslan and the bombing in Jakarta all demonstrate that we still have a long way to go in our fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Terrorism is a threat to all humankind that should meet with a resolute response on our part, regardless of when and where it occurs or of its motives. In that struggle, we should follow the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the basic norms of international law. We should also address the problem by examining its root causes and symptoms. On the one hand, we must strike against all terrorist activities. On the other, we must promote the common development of all countries, reduce the development gap and achieve social justice in order to eliminate the root causes of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">There should be no double standards in our fight against terrorism. We must promote enhanced understanding and tolerance among different civilizations. No country should take a firm stand vis- à-vis a threat it is facing while choosing to remain indifferent to other threats it considers remote. Doing so would send the wrong signal to terrorists and lead to further disasters. Moreover, it would create negative serious consequences for our international fight.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">China supports the United Nations in playing a leading role in our international effort against terrorism. We also support strengthening the roles of the CTC and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1257(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1257 (1999)</a>, given current developments. The fight against terrorist activities emanating from eastern Turkestan being undertaken by the Government and people of China is an important component of the international effort against terrorism and Al Qaeda. China will continue to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions and to participate actively in the work of both Committees. We will also make our contribution to striking against the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adechi</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">Allow me to thank Ambassador Muñoz for his exhaustive and very informative briefing on the activities of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> over the past four months.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">We also note that this meeting of the Security Council is being held in the wake of the commemoration of the third anniversary of the horrendous and tragic attacks of 11 September 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">The blind, criminal violence of terrorism continues to strike wherever it wishes. Terrorism has struck Beslan, in Russia, where hundreds of children and parents were killed; a diplomatic mission in Jakarta; and many other places where humanitarian workers are active, demonstrating unparalleled disdain for human life and an unrestrained assault against the essential principles on which today's international society is based. We therefore welcome the activities of the <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">1267 (1999)</a> Committee, which has assumed its due place among the instruments used in the fight against international terrorism as a responsive political monitoring body entrusted with managing the sanctions adopted by the Security Council against persons and entities associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, in close cooperation with the Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">The complexity of the task has required us to increase the human resources available to the Committee by establishing a group of experts to monitor the implementation of sanctions. We are pleased to note that the Committee and the experts group assisting it in its work have developed genuine synergy enabling them to monitor the relevance and efficacy of sanctions. In that regard, the results obtained to date are praiseworthy.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">If terrorism has been able to persist with the virulence we have seen recently, it is because it has continuously adapted itself in response to the measures taken to counter it. We therefore welcome the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team's stress on the varied ways in which the threat has evolved and the shortcomings in the current arrangements established to address it. The assessment calls on us either to revise the sanctions regime or at least to strengthen its global implementation. Clearly, the enhancement of cooperation among States Members of the United Nations is necessary to make the Consolidated List of persons and entities associated with Al Qaeda even more comprehensive and to improve the functional utility of the information it provides.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">We fully agree that those listed must be the subject of more consistent monitoring. Moreover, the ongoing violence also leads us to believe that Al Qaeda continues to find the means to finance attacks and to recruit new members to undertake them. Thus, the consideration of ways to adjust sanctions, which began within the framework of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, must be pursued. We look forward to the Monitoring Team's next report and hope that it will contain specific proposals for guiding the Security Council's work.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">We encourage the Team diligently to carry out the measures it foresees to refine further the monitoring of the implementation of sanctions. In that vein, we welcome the actions being considered by the Team to enhance the exchange of views and dialogue with Member States on the problems they face in the campaign against terrorism. The visits made or planned to certain countries will contribute to that dialogue and are an integral component of the Committee's quest for effectiveness. Furthermore, we believe that cooperation with the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee is essential and can greatly enhance the <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">1267 (1999)</a> Committee's effectiveness by allowing it fully to integrate the problems identified by both Committees in the effort to improve coordination within the international community's activities. Without effective coordination, the Security Council cannot ensure the consistency necessary to guarantee its own efficacy.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">Having said that, we believe that the relevant services of Member States must be pooled in order to facilitate the exchange of information between them in real time. It is also necessary to promote the establishment of conditions conducive to cooperation and mutual legal assistance among Member States. In our struggle, however, we must bear respect for international norms and law in mind.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa09">We agree with the Monitoring Team's analysis of the reasons cited by Member States that have been unable to provide reports to the Committee, in particular given its stress on the fact that a country's failure to report does not indicate a lack of commitment or determination at the international level to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban. In that regard, my delegation believes that we must find the means fully to integrate those countries into the information exchange arrangements, because the entire international community would benefit by reducing the vulnerability those countries experience as a result of their marginalization in the anti-terrorism campaign.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gaspar Martins</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I would like to start by expressing my delegation's appreciation for the convening of this debate on the work of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban. I thank the Chairman of the Committee, Ambassador Muñoz, for his very comprehensive report on the Committee's work and on the activities of the Monitoring Team established to assist the Committee in the fulfilment of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">Despite international efforts, the threat posed by Al Qaeda and the Taliban and the groups clearly associated with them remains as real today as it has been in the recent past. The hostage-taking in the Russian city of Beslan, perpetrated against civilians -- particularly shocking for its targeting of children -- and the bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta a few days ago demonstrate the need for the international community to further address the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">By adopting the regime of sanctions against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, the Security Council took the unprecedented step of bringing into force legislation binding on all States on the issue of combating terrorism. Such sanctions lay a strong foundation for halting the flow of money to terrorists associated with the Al Qaeda network as well as for preventing the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer of arms and military equipment.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">Despite progress achieved so far, particularly in the field of financial sanctions -- judging by the levels of Al Qaeda activity -- it appears that the sanctions regime imposed by the Security Council has only had a limited impact in effectively reducing the threat of terrorism. The current situation should lead to recognition of the need to strengthen the sanctions regime and, in this, we are in full agreement with Ambassador Muñoz and the set of measures he has proposed. The Committees should find additional ways of assessing the effectiveness of the implementation by Member States of the sanctions regime imposed on Al Qaeda and the Taliban and its impact, and of ensuring that credible reports of sanctions evasion result in a proactive response by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">The implementation of financial sanctions is an important aspect of the international campaign against terrorism. We share the views expressed in the report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team on that critical aspect. The Committee should continue to focus on alternative remittance systems, since the application of financial restrictions is an obligation for both the public and private sectors. The Committee should also focus its efforts on developing efficient public-private partnerships, including through the implementation of arms embargoes and travel bans. Partnerships have the potential to both complement the Committee's efforts to achieve its objectives and to contribute to its greater efficiency by introducing new working methods as required for the effectiveness of the sanctions implementation, which depends on the real and sustained support of the entire international community.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">The Consolidated List, as rightly pointed out in the report, is an important tool for meeting the objectives of Security Council resolutions, especially those aimed at preventing the financing of terrorism or the enforcement of travel bans. Member States should be encouraged to submit names for inclusion on the Consolidated List in order to maintain its relevance. The Committee, for its part, should consider procedures for delisting, whenever required. States and the Committee should strengthen their cooperation, ensuring that the credibility and usefulness of the Consolidated List will have a positive impact on Committee activities.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">Considering the important role entrusted to regional and subregional organizations, cooperation with intelligence services clearly needs to be strengthened. The creation, on both a regional and a subregional basis, of an electronic database containing all relevant data concerning persons, groups and entities subject to United Nations financial sanctions would provide a useful tool in the fight against terrorism. Terrorism is no longer a localized problem that can be fought by domestic action only. Measures to combat terrorism must be based on the broadest international cooperation, and in that regard we stress the importance of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1526 (2004)</a> for its emphasis on the need for further cooperation between the Committee's member States.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">To conclude, my delegation would like to take this opportunity to commend the role played by the Monitoring Team in furthering the work of the Committee and in monitoring compliance with the relevant Council resolutions. We also support the programme of work of the Committee, especially those activities regarding cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the need for permanent assessment of how sanctions are being applied on the ground, particularly through missions by the Chairman to the areas concerned.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank Ambassador Muñoz for his excellent presentation of the work of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, and of the Monitoring Team established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">My delegation attaches particular attention to the work of the Committee against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, convinced as it is of the seriousness of the threat posed by Al Qaeda, which has managed to adapt, continues to strike and runs rampant in various parts of the world. That is why we need to address this problem collectively and in a concerted manner. In our fight against terrorism, which should be a daily struggle, we need to show both firmness and vigilance. It is equally important that we attack this phenomenon in a resolute manner, dealing with all its various manifestations, as well as addressing all its underlying causes.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">That said, there are a number of positive notes on the register of the fight against terrorism that deserve to be underscored.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">First, we note that more than 130 States have already submitted reports and more than 90 countries have established teams to monitor assets belonging to terrorists, which is an additional milestone in the fight against Al Qaeda. It is now important that, in addition to submitting their reports, all Member States effectively implement the measures set out in the sanctions regime in order to vanquish that organization.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">Next, I would like to note the progress made by the Committee in implementing its mandate, as well as the work accomplished by the Monitoring Team in the few months since its establishment -- its support for the Committee in promoting the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions and in assessing the impact of measures announced and the recommendations proposed to enhance them, as well as the support given to the Chair of the Committee during his various visits to check on the implementation of the sanctions regime in the given countries.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">In that respect, I would like to point out that the Monitoring Team has met the deadlines set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a> by submitting its first written report, which is not only concise, balanced and of good quality, but also outlines new ideas and makes a series of recommendations that the Committee has already begun to consider in informal meetings.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">My delegation fully shares the Monitoring Team's analysis of the Al Qaeda phenomenon, which has mutated into a global network of groups linked not by an organizational structure but rather by a series of partially overlapping objectives. While underscoring that terrorism knows no religion or cultural affiliation and is indiscriminate in the selection of its victims, we cannot fail to note that the primary victims of terrorism are, in fact, the Muslim populations and countries themselves, including my own. And, increasingly, children are no longer spared by terrorist barbarities, as witnessed in the tragedy in Beslan.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">With regard to cooperation between the Committee and Member States, it is clear that it continues to be one of the most important aspects of the work of the Committee. Issues that deserve special attention include enhancing the quality of the List, dialogue with States and visits to given States. In that respect, my delegation believes it would be ill-advised to suspend or remove the names of individuals or entities from the List because of insufficient information. What is important is not the information itself, but the danger or the threat posed by such individuals to peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">We encourage the Chairman to continue his visits in the field in order to strengthen dialogue with Member States and to check on the implementation of sanctions measures. The visits to Asia scheduled in November will certainly be extremely useful to the work of the Committee, given the surge of Al Qaeda networks in that region and the attacks perpetrated there -- most recently an attack in Jakarta against the Australian Embassy, an act which my delegation firmly condemns.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">In addition, we support the Committee in the specific tasks it has to undertake. We encourage it especially to listen more attentively to Member States and to share their concerns, just as we encourage it to further develop cooperation and coordination in particular with the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and its Executive Director with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> and with the international organizations and agencies who have expertise in the struggle against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">In general terms, the recommendations proposed by the Monitoring Team will enhance the sanctions regime. In that regard, we encourage the Monitoring Team to make specific recommendations to encourage Member States to submit names for the Consolidated List, to better regulate the transboundary movement of capital, to prevent the abuse of charitable organizations, and to resolve the issue of the right to asylum.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">On this last matter, I would emphasize that, in my statement to the Council on 25 May 2004, I indicated that we need to think further about better use of the opportunities provided under Chapter VII of the Charter, in order to encourage States to fully cooperate in the fight against terrorism, including with respect to the issue of extradition. Concerning extradition, we would like the Al Qaeda and Taliban Monitoring Team to address the issue of the right to asylum in order to strengthen international judicial cooperation. Let me point out here that, to date, the right to asylum continues, unfortunately, to be abusively granted to terrorist organizations and to individuals involved in acts of terrorism in their countries of origin, thereby voiding the institution of the right to asylum of its substance and above all, conveying impunity to known criminals.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa13">The rigorous collection and processing of information, in particular with respect to the issue of security, is more than recommended to provide an objective appraisal of the threats to peace and security. The rash and somewhat superficial categorization of North African nationals associated with acts of terrorism linked to Al Qaeda as being a so-called risk factor to the Arabian peninsula leaves me somewhat puzzled. Such categorization can, in fact, lead to mistaken conclusions and to dangerous distortions because, while there are North African terrorist groups, and they are indeed on the List of the Committee, those groups unfortunately and undoubtedly are not the only ones. There are other groups that are indeed rampant, not only in the Arabian peninsula, but in other countries in the world. These are the few points that I want to make in order that the Monitoring Team provide us with an objective and documented clarification in its second report, scheduled for December.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. García Moritán</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">First of all I wish to thank the Ambassador of Chile, Heraldo Muñoz, for the oral briefing he has given us and for the work he and his delegation have been doing in the Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban. As has been regrettably demonstrated by the recent appalling terrorist attacks in Indonesia and Russia, including the tragedy of Beslan, in which more than 300 people, half of them children, lost their lives, terrorism continues to be one of the gravest threats faced by the international community at the present time.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">The possibility that those responsible for the attacks may have links with the Al Qaeda organization, as indicated by the media, indicates the scale of the task facing the 1267 Committee and the magnitude of the challenges the Committee must confront. We should also underscore the high quality of the work of the Al Qaeda and Taliban Monitoring Team established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>. The first report presented by the Team, which is now before the Committee for consideration, is a serious and rather comprehensive analysis of the questions and problems encountered by the Committee in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">In this statement I shall address the work of the Al Qaeda and Taliban Monitoring Team and the initiatives to enhance contacts between the Committee and Member States. The Monitoring Team's report contains a number of suggestions to enhance the effectiveness of the work of the Committee, which deserve careful consideration. Many of the suggestions should be adopted once the Committee is in agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">The recommendations relating to the Consolidated List of individuals and entities subject to sanctions are particularly relevant. The List, as has already been stated, is the Committee's main working tool; accordingly, it should be given the requisite priority. It should always be kept up to date and seen always by Member States as an efficient contribution to the endeavour to combat terrorism sponsored by the Al Qaeda network. In particular, it is important to clearly establish procedures for making adjustments to the Consolidated List, should new relevant information be submitted. As the Chairman of the Committee clearly stated in his briefing, the Team has hinted at a number of measures that might be taken to improve the functionality and credibility of the consolidated list. The Committee should derive full benefit from this contribution.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">In some cases, the report of the Monitoring Group indicates an intention to present recommendations, or identifies aspects of the Committee's work where they suggest adjustments should be made. In both instances, my delegation would request the Monitoring Team to present specific suggestions for the Committee's consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">As has been indicated, the Committee is discussing ways and means of adapting its guidelines for action to the changes introduced in the work of the Committee by the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a> and it would be important, in that regard, to have specific input from the Monitoring Team. In particular, it would be appropriate to consider expanding and clarifying the procedures relating to the delisting of individuals or entities. Such an initiative might serve as an incentive for States that may have doubts about presenting requests for inclusion of individuals or entities, because they are not clear as to the possible difficulties they would face should the need arise to remove the individual or entity from the sanctions List.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">The last issue mentioned in the report, for which we need further clarification, is that of due legal process. That matter has been under consideration by the Committee for some time, without any progress having been made on the topic. Specific proposals from the Monitoring Team for the consideration of the Committee could be an important contribution in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">With regard to enhancing cooperation between Member States and the work of the Committee, my delegation takes the view that adoption of measures to refine the List and clarify the procedures used in handling it are the main way in which the Committee can encourage the provision of contributions to the Consolidated List from Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">The travels of the Chairman and the Monitoring Team are at the same time an important instrument in garnering impressions and learning from the experience of those authorities directly responsible for counter-terrorism activities. However, as the Chairman of the Committee noted in his briefing, it is important to be able to translate the concerns and experiences of the States visited by him and the members of the Monitoring Team into adjustments in the sanctions regime, in order to make its implementation more effective.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">We also support the offer made again today by the Chairman of the Committee to the effect that Member States wishing to do so, may hold meetings with the Committee to discuss pertinent topics as provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">Lastly, as has been clear from the statements made throughout the meeting, there is a wide range of significant challenges facing the Committee to increase efficiency in its struggle against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. However, as has already been stated, terrorism is a global threat which can be combated only through the concentrated endeavours of the international community. Above and beyond the action that may be taken within the Committee or the Security Council itself, the genuine triumphs in the struggle against a scourge that does not acknowledge or respect borders will depend on the ability of the entire international community to work in concert to find solutions to the problems that lie at the origin of the inexcusable terrorist acts which unfortunately continue to be perpetrated.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Spain.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">I am grateful to the Chairman of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban, Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, for his comprehensive briefing relating to the work of that important Committee over the last three months. I wish my first words to be those of appreciation for his work and that of his skilled team.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">Speaking on behalf of my country, I would also like to associate myself with the statement to be made later by the representative of the Netherlands, which holds the presidency of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">With regard to the work of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, I would like to highlight the impetus provided by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a> -- adopted on 30 January -- which has provided a strengthened framework within which the Committee can carry out its objectives. In order for that framework to be able to work in practice, however, new guidelines must be adopted relating to the work of the Committee, and these are being discussed today. We urge all States members of the Committee, therefore, to resolve the few outstanding questions as soon as possible. My delegation will provide its full support in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">With regard to the work of the Monitoring Team, we believe that it has done a commendable job in the first few months of its existence and that its report represents a key contribution to identifying problems and possible ways of improving not just the work of the Committee itself but also the activities of the United Nations in general in combating the scourge of terrorism. As Ambassador Muñoz rightly pointed out, the report reflects the opinion of the Monitoring Team only and is not, therefore, the official position of the Committee or of the Security Council. Nonetheless, we believe that the problems that it sets out and the solutions that it proposes must be tackled in depth by the Committee on an urgent basis.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">The Team has rightly pointed out that the traditional sanctions system of the United Nations was designed to target States, not entities or individuals, and that in that respect it has therefore had only a limited impact. It is clear that the question of sanctions goes far beyond the scope of this meeting. In view of its importance, however, we urge the informal Working Group on General Issues on Sanctions, chaired by Ambassador Adechi of Benin, and the Secretary-General himself, to continue to work on those issues.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">The Consolidated List -- the Committee's main working tool -- faces two problems, among others, as noted by the Monitoring Team. The first is the need to improve the basic identifying data for individuals and entities included on the List. In this regard, we believe that it would be appropriate to approach international organizations that have broad experience in combating transnational organized crime -- in particular, Interpol -- to assist us in that work. It is a question not of doing something new, but of applying well-tested methods that have recognized practical efficiency.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa08">The second issue is the need to establish a procedure for the possible removal of names from the List. We believe that that is a key issue if we are to maintain sufficient guarantees for the persons or entities affected and preserve the universal legitimacy of the work of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> -- and, consequently, of the overall activity of the United Nations in combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa09">With regard to the financial aspects, important steps forward have been taken in the context of the formal financial system to control the flow of assets that could be intended for the perpetration of terrorist acts. In this regard, we should highlight the work done by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which, through its eight special recommendations on counter-terrorist financing, has set an example of efficiency. Spain would like to see the scope of the application of the FATF to be extended from its current 31 members to all the States Members of the United Nations. It is certainly well known that the problem of the financing of terrorism is the control not only of the banking system but also of other methods used by individuals and terrorist groups, including -- as the report of the Monitoring Team states -- systems of money transfer by cash couriers. We must pay more attention to those areas.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa10">As regards arms embargoes, the Monitoring Team stressed that, as with sanctions, they have always been conceived with a view to the targeting of States. The danger that terrorist groups -- in particular Al Qaeda -- might acquire weapons of mass destruction is disconcertingly real. That is why Spain welcomes the Team's intention to closely follow the work of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> and its recommendation to add to the Consolidated List the names of those identified as supplying Al Qaeda with material or expertise that could enable it to acquire such weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa11">Finally, with regard to the travel ban on individuals and entities on the Consolidated List, Spain fully concurs with the recommendation of the Monitoring Team that there is a need to improve the application of the ban, since it has had very little or no effect on Al Qaeda activities. There is a need for the establishment of a rapid communications system among the competent States authorities, in particular border authorities, so that when a person on the Consolidated List is arrested or detained, it will be possible immediately to trigger the appropriate procedure for that person's handover or extradition to the State whose justice system is seeking him or her.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, there is a need for greater and better coordination among the various instruments available to the United Nations with a view to promoting international cooperation in combating terrorism. It is vital to have a fluid exchange within the Security Council among the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the recently created Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>. In addition, the General Assembly, as well as the Secretariat, should act forcefully on an issue that, in the words of the Secretary-General, assails the spirit and the purposes of the United Nations. I would like to recall the words of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who stated</p>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa13">"Everything that we work for -- peace, development, health, freedom -- is damaged by this horror. Everything that we believe in -- respect for human life, justice, tolerance, pluralism and democracy -- is threatened by it. It must be defeated -- and it must be defeated by a world acting as one." (<i><a href="../pdf/SG-SM-8376.pdf" class="nolink">SG/SM/8376</a>, para. 7</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa14">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa15">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Australia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dauth</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank you very much, Mr. President, for having convened this meeting. I, like others, would like to begin by thanking our friend and colleague, Heraldo Muñoz, for his very comprehensive briefing this morning. As always, it was a typically professional effort from him and his colleagues. We continue to support their efforts very strongly.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">Three years after the attacks of 11 September 2001 and five years after the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, the international community regrettably confronts new terrorist atrocities with shocking regularity. Most recently, of course, the people of Russia have suffered grievously in attacks targeting airliners, city streets and -- most appallingly -- the school in Beslan. And, as members are aware, in Indonesia last week, at least nine people were killed and 180 injured in a bomb blast outside the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. In that regard, I am very grateful for the expressions of sympathy around this table today.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa03">The good news is that Indonesian and Australian authorities are working hand in hand -- as they did in the wake of the Bali and J.W. Marriott Hotel attacks -- to track down the perpetrators and bring them to justice. In Australia's region and further afield, Governments are working more closely together than ever before to combat terrorism, with some noteworthy successes.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa04">But, as the Monitoring Team's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-679.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/679</a>) makes clear, the threat from Al Qaeda-related terrorism remains as serious as ever and is evolving. Terrorist groups rallying around the banner of Al Qaeda's extremist cause increasingly have few obvious links to Al Qaeda's leadership or to other listed groups or individuals. They nevertheless operate according to Al Qaeda's agenda and follow its example. It is vital that States take all measures under the <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> regime to constrain the activities of such groups.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa05">The pressing challenge -- rightly identified by the Monitoring Team -- is to ensure that the Consolidated List of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities remains responsive to those developments. Member States must contribute to the ongoing improvement and revision of the List. Australia played a leading role in having Jemaah Islamiyah and associated individuals listed in October 2002. We remain alert to any developments that might require revised or additional listings, and we urge other Member States to do likewise. Governments need to ensure that, as Al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups mutate, those Governments have the tools to cut off the terrorists' finances and other support.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa06">Improving the effectiveness of the 1267 regime also requires improved implementation by Member States. Many have limited capacity to meet their obligations. Australia supports ongoing efforts to facilitate better national implementation and reporting. We see the Monitoring Team's closer coordination with the Counter-Terrorism Committee -- and with other United Nations and regional bodies and Member States engaged in related work -- as crucial in that respect. In particular, we welcome the programme of outreach by Committee Chairman Muñoz and look forward to his proposed visit to Australia next month. Australia's determination to combat terrorism, including through building strong United Nations mechanisms, is unwavering.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of the Netherlands. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. van den Berg</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The candidate countries Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Turkey; the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Serbia and Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; and the European Free Trade Association countries Iceland and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">Terrorism has many faces and guises; the struggle against terrorism has as many fronts. Almost every day, we hear about new instances of vicious attacks in various parts of the world. In that respect, we would like to express our grief at the loss of life in Jakarta and Beslan. No matter what the cause, the location or the scale, the European Union condemns any terrorist attack, shares its deep compassion with the victims and remains firmly committed to stay the course in the combat against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa03">Today, the Security Council is discussing the sanctions against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The European Union thanks Ambassador Muñoz for his informative briefing and for his excellent ongoing work as Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa04">The European Union welcomes the first report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-679.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/679</a>). Although the sanctions have been successful, the report rightly concentrates on ways and means to improve their implementation in order to further tighten the net around Al Qaeda.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa05">At the analytical level, the report concisely describes the changing nature of the threat. The sanctions were designed to combat a group that was operating from a central base with a strong core leadership, in most instances using conventional weapons. Now Al Qaeda manifests itself through a network of loosely affiliated groups. It operates more or less without a central command, making inventive use of the Internet, combined with unconventional means of delivery.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa06">The analysis is not new. Over time, the sanctions have been modified and widened to include groups and individuals from all over the world. However, the basics of the sanctions have remained the same, while the basics of Al Qaeda have changed drastically. Consequently, the report suggests a more fundamental refocusing to even better reflect the changed circumstances. To some extent, these are uncharted waters for the Council. It will be a great challenge to design sanctions against an enemy that is so fluid and intangible in appearance. The looser its organization, the more difficult it might be to define Al Qaeda and the threat it poses. However, it is crucial that the Security Council remain on top of this issue, constantly refine its ways to deal with the threat in accordance with international law and provide the world community with clear direction in this battle.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa07">Again, the European Union commends the Monitoring Team for raising these issues and stirring up the debate. We hope the second report will further build on the analysis presented. As stipulated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, the Team might want to make concrete recommendations for new measures.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa08">The report also offers recommendations for the implementation of the sanctions as they stand today. Indeed, there remains much work to be done and much ground to be gained in order to further increase the impact of the current sanctions. The effectiveness of the sanctions regime is contingent on the quality of the Consolidated List of individuals and entities. States are encouraged to actively contribute to the List, thus making the sanctions more effective and at the same time broadening ownership. In addition, we must all do our utmost to constantly update information on the individuals and entities already on the List and to transform the List from a static to a dynamic document. In that context, the European Union would also welcome an examination of the current delisting procedures in the light of the general issue of due process.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa09">The European Union would like to add its voice to the appeal to all Member States to comply with other aspects of the sanctions. The European Union agrees on the necessity of reports that go beyond mere description of intentions or regulations and that instead provide honest assessments of implementation at the operational level. Respect for the rule of law and fundamental human rights should at all times be an integral part of the implementation. Such respect actually enhances the effectiveness and credibility of the sanctions.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa10">While the Monitoring Team is in a unique position to observe States' failure to comply, it lacks the capacity to provide technical assistance. Both the Monitoring Team and the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities should continue to strengthen ties with organizations that could facilitate or provide such assistance. I would mention here the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and its new Executive Directorate, but also regional organizations and other United Nations bodies, including the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The European Union stands ready to be a constructive partner in this respect. By the same token, we encourage the intention of the Monitoring Team to explore potential areas of cooperation with the Committee established under United Nations Security Council resolution 1540 on prevention of proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa11">Finally, the report recommends that the Committee pursue ways to make the financial measures more effective. It specifically calls on the Committee to look at the role of alternative remittance systems, cash couriers and charitable organizations. The European Union welcomes these recommendations. In this regard, I would like to point out that the Netherlands presidency of the European Union, in close cooperation with Mr. Gijs de Vries, the European Union Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, has organized a seminar on 22 September on this very topic. We will ensure that the outcome of the seminar will be shared with both the Security Council's 1267 Committee and the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa12">Let me reiterate the wholehearted support of the European Union to the firm and creative approach of Ambassador Muñoz and the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team. The European Union stands ready to fully support the unconditional and unqualified implementation of the sanctions regime. We also look forward to contributing to the ongoing debate on refining and refocusing the sanctions to reflect the changing nature of the threat of Al Qaeda.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Japan, whom I invite to take a seat at the Council table and to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haraguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank Ambassador Muñoz for today's detailed presentation.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">As demonstrated by the recent cowardly terrorist attacks which took the lives of many citizens of the Russian Federation, including a large number of innocent children, and the terrorist bombing outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, cases of terrorism seem to be on the increase rather than in decline, leaving us far from our goal of eliminating terror. The situation continues to deteriorate and is truly worrisome. Japan, while extending its deepest condolences to the families and relatives of the victims, strongly condemns these brutal acts and feels all the more acutely the necessity of further strengthening international cooperation with a view to preventing similar acts from occurring in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">Having heard the Chairman's briefing and reviewed the first report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-679.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/679</a>) of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities, issued last month, I wish to express my country's concern over the situation highlighted in the report. The threat of terrorism perpetrated by Al Qaeda and related groups remains as real today as it was three years ago, as exemplified by the terror-related activities of the new generation of Al Qaeda members as well as the remaining Taliban elements in Afghanistan. Bearing in mind the continuing threat posed by terrorism worldwide, I would like to make the following three points.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">First, Japan places importance on the Committee's Consolidated List, and we strongly hope that more information will be submitted for inclusion in the Consolidated List in an efficient manner, so that Member States will have access to more substantial information. However, as my country has already learned through experience, inclusion in the List of the names of individuals or entities suspected of involvement in terrorism is not an easy process, because it can only be accomplished through consensus and there are several hurdles a submitting country must overcome to secure final approval of its application from the Committee. From this point of view, as recommended by the Monitoring Team in its report, Japan welcomes the Committee's policy of updating the List so as to make it a more effective and accurate tool for combating terrorism. We also believe it important to establish a procedure that would facilitate amendments based on new information. In particular, based on our experience, we consider it necessary that effective methods be devised to deal with cases in which terrorists open financial accounts abroad by illegally assuming the identities of actual individuals. Furthermore, we welcome the Monitoring Team's recommendation to add to the Consolidated List the names of individuals and groups found to be supplying Al Qaeda-associated terrorists with materials and expertise for the construction of weapons designed to cause mass casualties. We believe that this will serve to hinder the terrorists' preparations for attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">My second point concerns terrorist financing and weapons. As the report of the Monitoring Team indicates, in the most recent terrorist attacks, which have been causing in a high number of casualties, Al Qaeda members have been operating at a relatively low cost, relying on amounts in the five-figure range in United States dollars. This tactic makes it difficult to detect transfers of funds and to cut off the sources of financing. The high frequency of suicide bombings, as seen in the recent attack near a subway station in Moscow, also presents an alarming situation, and it is important that we discover the means to prevent devices and materials not covered under arms embargoes from being diverted for use in terrorists' weapons. The Monitoring Team's indication that sanction measures must be adjusted according to the changes in the methods adopted by terrorists is entirely appropriate, and we need to take effective measures to prevent terrorists from taking advantage of loopholes in our sanction measures. From that viewpoint, we understand that the Monitoring Team will undertake further studies in order to make recommendations on stronger and more effective sanction measures, and we are looking forward to the outcome of these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">The third matter I wish to emphasize is the need for greater intra-organizational cooperation within the United Nations. Japan has pointed out in the past that cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in information-sharing and analysis is important, and we appreciate that the Monitoring Team has already, on several occasions, engaged with the experts of the CTC in assessing threats and evaluating the needs of Member States in the area of capacity-building. Cooperation with the Committee established under Security Council resolution 1540 on prevention of proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons is also crucial, since terrorists associated with Al Qaeda are using unconventional weapons to murder non-combatants on a massive scale. We believe it very important that the committees and other organizations related to counter-terrorism start cooperating more effectively among themselves in the fight against terror.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">As Ambassador Muñoz has also emphasized on previous occasions, we need to pursue our counter-terrorism policy in a concerted manner, in view of the fact that the Al Qaeda network is global in its reach and that the world is watching to see how decisively the United Nations will act to undertake counter-terrorism initiatives.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">Japan supports the work of the sanctions Committee and the various related Security Council resolutions, including <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, and wishes to offer its full cooperation toward the realization of an effective counter-terrorism policy through the implementation of the relevant resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">Finally, I would like to express our appreciation for the dedication of Ambassador Muñoz and of his outstanding staff, as well as for the efforts of the Committee secretariat and of the Monitoring Team experts, whose activities are now fully under way.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Singapore. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Menon</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of September, and to wish you every success as you and other members of the Security Council deal with several difficult issues on the Council's agenda. I also join other delegations in thanking you for organizing this public meeting. My delegation would also like to thank Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, for his comprehensive briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">In the past fortnight, the world has witnessed another rash of heinous terrorist acts: the almost simultaneous destruction of two Russian passenger aircraft, the abominable hostage-taking in a Russian school and the bombing outside the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. We are again reminded that terrorism is a clear and present danger around the world. Singapore joins others in strongly condemning those atrocities. We also express our solidarity and sympathy with those affected.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">Each country must take responsibility for its own security. But that is not enough. International cooperation is vital if we are to be able to effectively confront the threat of transnational terrorism. The events that we are witnessing are not isolated episodes of terrorism. They reflect the existence of a terrorist network with global reach that is capable of organizing deliberate and prolonged acts of terrorism around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">Al Qaeda has spawned a network of affiliated terrorist groups around the world that subscribes not only to its extreme terror tactics but also to its deviant ideology. In South-East Asia, the extremist regional network Jemaah Islamiyah, which is Al Qaeda's principal representative in the region, wants to establish an Islamic caliphate comprising much of South-East Asia, including Singapore. Investigations under way clearly point the finger of suspicion for the recent bombing in Jakarta to that group.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">We need to work together to deal with the unprecedented challenge of transnational terrorism. While the efforts of individual countries are extremely important, the war against terrorism cannot be won by the efforts of one country alone. International networking and cooperation are also essential. An effective network requires support from individuals equipped not just with special skills, but also with a common understanding of the bigger security strategic picture.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Singapore will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations in this area. We have, for example, cooperated fully and in a timely fashion with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee and its Monitoring Team. Singapore has worked closely with other countries in implementing a series of practical anti-terror measures. Singapore has, and will continue, to work with like-minded countries from our region and beyond in intelligence exchanges, capacity-building activities and counter-terrorism operations.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">In Singapore, we have implemented many security measures to harden the country against the terrorist threat, including critical infrastructure protection and border controls. We have also sought to change the general public's mindset to stress that security is a paramount, and not a peripheral, issue. We have mobilized Government agencies, the business community and the general public to work together in a concerted national effort against the threat of transnational terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, we join others in urging countries to stand firm and not waiver in the campaign against terrorism, here at the United Nations and domestically.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sen</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">As this is the first statement I am making in the Security Council, let me begin by extending my warm greetings to you, Mr. President, and to your colleagues in the Council. Please allow me also to extend our heartiest felicitations to you for assuming the presidency of the Security Council for this important month in the calendar of activities of the United Nations. I also wish take to this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Andrey Denisov of the Russian Federation on his exemplary stewardship of the Council during his presidency in the month of August. I also wish to thank Ambassador Muñoz, Chairman of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, for his comprehensive briefing on the considerable progress achieved in the work of the Committee since the last public meeting on this issue. I would also like to place on record our appreciation for Ambassador Muñoz and his able team, as well as for concerned members of the United Nations Secretariat, for the direction they have provided in the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Al Qaeda-Taliban sanctions regime.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">It has been three years since the attacks of 11 September in New York. Unfortunately, since then, incidents of terrorism in the Russian Federation, Spain, Saudi Arabia, India and other parts of the world have amply demonstrated that international terrorism is not a passing phenomenon. In fact, as Ambassador Muñoz has rightly reiterated, it constitutes today one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">The horrific images of the heinous murder of some 300 innocent civilians, mainly children, at the hands of terrorists in Beslan, in the Russian Federation, less than a fortnight ago, are still fresh in our minds. The bomb attack outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta on 9 September, which claimed at least nine lives, was a manifestation of the same malaise -- of international terrorism representing an attack on all civilized nations. I wish to take this opportunity to extend our deepest sympathy to the Governments of the Russian Federation and Indonesia, and our heartfelt condolences to the victims of the attacks and their families. We are with them in sorrow and solidarity.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">The international community will have to do more than issuing routine condemnations of such acts of terrorism. It will have to act at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels to speedily and effectively address the clear and present danger represented by international terrorism. The Security Council Committees established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> are an important facet of the international community's response. It is therefore only natural that we carefully analyse the strategy adopted by those bodies in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">The appointment of a new and efficient Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, is a welcome development. We agree with the Chairman that the Team deserves to be commended for having produced a concise, well-conceived and high-quality document for its first report. I should like to provide our comments on some aspects of the report of the Monitoring Team.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">The assessment of the Monitoring Team that the threat from Al Qaeda terrorism remains as real today as it has been at any time since October 1999 has been validated by the number and intensity of attacks worldwide, with their ideological underpinnings traceable to Al Qaeda.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">The Monitoring Team's conclusion that the sanctions regime imposed by the Security Council has had a limited impact is disappointing, as it reflects a continuation of the trend reported by the previous Monitoring Group in its first report issued pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1455(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1455 (2003)</a>. In our statement on 29 July 2003, during a public debate in the Council on the same item, we noted that the Monitoring Group had reported on the limitations of the sanctions regime, in particular the continuing ability of Al Qaeda to finance its activities, the ineffectiveness of the travel ban, the continued use of small arms and light weapons and the nexus between drug smuggling and terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">Where the report of the Monitoring Team is encouraging is in its recommendations on the ways and means to address the existing limitations. Most of the recommendations appear to be provisional, but could, in our view, form the basis for refinement of the existing measures required to adapt them to the changes in the nature of Al Qaeda/Taliban operations.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa09">We agree with the assessment of the Team that the Taliban remain a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of Afghanistan. We do not, however, believe that the mutual support between the Al Qaeda and Taliban is confined to assistance with local needs, nor do we subscribe to the perception that the relevance of the Taliban was confined to the means and space they provided Al Qaeda to flourish. It has to be reiterated here that the Taliban was an offshoot of the same fundamentalist and militant ideology that spawned the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and elsewhere in the world. The fact that they continue to operate within Afghanistan is a telling indicator of the support and safe haven they continue to receive. The inescapable but unstated conclusion of the report's analysis is of the integral, seamless nature of the Al Qaeda/Taliban relationship, their common ideological incubators and training. It is this Committee's mandate to identify those individuals and entities which represent that group with the intention of bringing to bear upon them the measures envisaged under the relevant resolutions, including <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, and we hope it will do so without fear or favour.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa10">We also agree with the conclusion that the Consolidated list suffers from practical and technical problems. In our view, the first priority of the Committee and the Monitoring Team should be to convince Member States to be more forthcoming with information, particularly with regard to the Taliban, on individuals and entities in territories under their control. The second should be to hold States that harbour such listed individuals or entities accountable for non-compliance with the relevant Chapter VII resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa11">We appreciate the stated objective of the Monitoring Team to engage and cooperate with Member States in the implementation of its mandate. Some ideas enunciated in this regard, including the convening of a small group of professionals with the requisite experience and expertise to enhance understanding on the issue and the proposal to conclude an international agreement that would preclude offer of asylum to those on the Consolidated List are noteworthy and should be further explored.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa12">We also welcome the increase in the number of tours to States to enhance coordination and information exchanges. We would caution, however, that to optimize results, such visits should be carefully coordinated between the Chair, the Committee and the Monitoring Team. Ideally, a visit of that nature to a Member State should involve all three components, and possibly even the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, in the context of greater cooperation envisaged with these bodies. That would enable a more coherent presentation of the exchange of views, better access and less duplication in terms of time and money. The differing roles of the Committee and the Team can be reconciled by bifurcating field visits or meetings after completion of the common elements of the programme.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa13">We do hope that, in keeping with its professed spirit of cooperation and transparency, the Committee will authorize a more liberal sharing of information with the general membership on the results of such visits.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa14">The report of the Monitoring Team has allowed us to start working on a new set of recommendations designed to increase the efficacy and relevance of the sanctions measures against such terrorist groups as the Taliban and Al Qaeda. We are confident that some of the ideas those recommendations represent will receive further expression by the time the next report of the Team is due. The continued relevance of the Committee and all of our efforts depend on keeping ahead of the game.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa15">Before I conclude, I would also endorse the implication of the Secretary-General's words that you quoted, Sir, and of the remarks on making the sanctions more effective through a regime of fundamental freedoms, as referred to by the Ambassador of the Netherlands, speaking on behalf of the European Union. In that context, I would like to say that the present Government of India, with its heritage of secularism, and voted in by the rural poor, is committed in its common minimum programme to the abolition of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, because we firmly believe that it is only in the context of fundamental rights, the rule of law, access to defence counsel and all the other provisions thereunder that a sanctions regime can be truly and effectively implemented by any country.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa16">I wish, finally, to conclude by offering our full cooperation in fulfilling the objectives of the Team and our willingness to share the expertise developed in India and accumulated through decades of experience in countering terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of India for his kind words addressed to the Spanish presidency and the membership of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Indonesia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jenie</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset, on behalf of my delegation, to express our sincere appreciation to you, Sir, and the members of the Security Council for convening this public meeting on the report of the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> regarding its overall work and the Monitoring Team. I would like also to take this opportunity to extend our gratitude to Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, and its members and experts for their dedication and hard work.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">Recently, Indonesia has again become the target and victim of acts of terrorism. On 9 September 2004, a bomb exploded near the entrance gate of the premises of the Australian embassy in Jakarta. Ten people lost their lives and about 182 were injured in the attack. Let me take this opportunity, on behalf of the Government and the people of Indonesia, to acknowledge and deeply appreciate the expressions of sympathy and condolence from the international community. Indonesia and Indonesians from all walks of life strongly condemn the terrorist attack in Jakarta and are determined to bring all the perpetrators of that cruel and heinous crime to justice. At the same time, we are not going to let our country become a land of fear and insecurity. Indeed, the Indonesian Government has already taken the necessary measures to deal with the attack. We are again deeply appreciative of the offers of cooperation and assistance in that regard, particularly from the Government of Australia.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">Let me reiterate that Indonesia is highly committed to fighting terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We believe that terrorism represents a serious threat to international peace and security and we stand ready to support measures against it at the national, regional and global levels.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">The recent visit by the Monitoring Team of the Committee to Jakarta was fruitful in allowing us to share the experience and challenges faced by Indonesia in implementing the sanctions. I should not deny that further efforts and wider collaboration at all levels are needed.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">Indonesia fully endorses the call on member countries to further improve the quality of the Consolidated List. I believe that problems arising from the incompleteness of background information on individuals can be resolved by adding more information to the List. In this case, countries that have submitted names to the List should be able also to share more information with other countries. The completeness of the list will not only enhance the effectiveness of the list but will also minimize or eliminate mistakes in the efforts to apprehend individuals connected to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. In that regard, Indonesia welcomes the efforts of the Monitoring Team to improve its working methods, as set out in its first report.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa06">Finally, I would like to stress Indonesia's conviction that terrorism is the problem of every nation and that we can best combat and vanquish this menace through multidimensional and multilateral approaches based on international law and respect for human rights. Indonesia is one such party, and as we have stated in the past, we stand ready to take the necessary measures and to work with other States and organizations to ensure that terrorism will have nowhere left to hide and that it will be defeated.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Indonesia for his kind words addressed to me and to other members of the Council. I invite him to resume the seat reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Malaysia, whom I invite to take a seat and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rastam</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">My delegation is pleased to address this timely public meeting of the Security Council. We welcome the first report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1526 (2004)</a> and express our sincere appreciation to the Monitoring Team. We also congratulate Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities, for his clear and comprehensive presentation of the report and his personal commitment towards the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">I should like to convey the deepest sympathies of my delegation to the families of the victims and to all those injured or affected by the heinous crimes of terrorism that recently occurred in Russia and Jakarta. Malaysia categorically condemns all acts of terrorism and remains convinced that terrorism is never justifiable, irrespective of its motivations and objectives or its forms and manifestations.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">My delegation appreciates the efforts of and the role played by the 1267 Committee in combating terrorism, in particular through the sanctions regime that it has elaborated. That regime constitutes an important instrument in our common struggle against terrorism. We also appreciate the Monitoring Team's first report on the implementation of measures by States and its recommendations on ways to make those measures more effective and on new measures for consideration by the Security Council. In that regard, we have taken note of the recommendations and proposals that could be implemented by Member States to improve further the efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">With regard to the great variation in the quality of reports submitted by Member States, my delegation looks forward to a more focused questionnaire that could help in the standardization of reports and in the easier preparation of the reports. We hope for improved coordination between the Monitoring Team and the Committee with a view to enhancing its performance and helping the Team to continue and improve its analytical reporting to the Security Council. We also hope that cooperation between the 1267 Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> will continue to improve so that the problem of apparent overlap with the reporting requirements of the Counter-Terrorism Committee can be overcome.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">We are satisfied that the Committee's Chairman, Ambassador Muñoz, and the Monitoring Team plan to continue their field visits and dialogue with Member States. The Monitoring Team recently visited Malaysia. In our assessment, it was a good visit. The Malaysian authorities gave their fullest cooperation. We look forward to continuing the dialogue and to further cooperating with the Team and the Committee in our common endeavour against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">My delegation remains concerned that there is yet to be an internationally agreed definition of terrorism. Malaysia believes that a universally accepted definition of terrorism is important to enable the international community to take concerted and effective action against those who have been defined as terrorists. Listing designated individuals, groups and entities in the Consolidated List as a result of the absence of such definition has resulted in the list losing its credibility and operational value. It is imperative for the Monitoring Team to update the List in terms of its relevance and accuracy, with the full cooperation of Member States, including the delisting of people as appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">It is encouraging to note that sanctions against the financing of terrorism have had some effect. A large amount of assets has been frozen, although there is still a need for continuous updating based on the Al Qaeda modus operandi for raising and transferring money. The Monitoring Team has also identified similar needs to improve the travel ban and the arms embargo to reflect current Al Qaeda methodology. In this regard, Malaysia stands ready to implement new measures within its means so that international efforts to combat terrorism can be carried out in an impartial and objective manner, in accordance with the principles of international law.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">It is essential to bear in mind that combating terrorism is one of a number of often interrelated priority tasks of this Organization. In many parts of the world, a central challenge remains the eradication of poverty and underdevelopment, which constitute a serious threat to peace and security. To this end the campaign against terrorism should also take into account the poor of the world, who require resources to extricate themselves from their poverty and underdevelopment.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa09">Terrorists take advantage of the sense of despair and the frustration that arise when people are forced to live without hope and without freedom. Terrorists also capitalize on situations where States violate human rights during their counter-terrorism operations. Terrorism feeds on many things: the use of force and foreign occupation, territory forcibly occupied, land wrongfully seized, homes bombed and bulldozed to rubble, ethnic cleansing, religious persecution, trampling of legitimate political aspiration, oppression, poverty, deprivation and, most of all, the absence of satisfactory avenues to seek redress. Malaysia strongly believes that it is absolutely essential that curative approaches in dealing with terrorism be prescribed. The root causes of terrorism must be addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa10">The challenges facing the international community in combating terrorism require a multipronged and multidimensional approach. Such an approach includes national, regional and international efforts in identifying and addressing the root causes, undertaking strict and stern enforcement measures, undertaking psychological warfare programmes to counter the destructive influence of the extremists and terrorists, and providing training and expertise to officers and institutions involved in counter-terrorism activities.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa11">In line with our recognition that action to counter terrorism requires integrated efforts at the regional and international level, Malaysia established the South East Asia Regional Center for Counter Terrorism (SEARCCT) in July 2003. The establishment of SEARCCT has received endorsement from the thirty-sixth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Phnom Penh in June 2003. The Center primarily focuses on training and capacity building in prevention of terrorist activities and management of post-terrorism situations. These include actions against money-laundering and terrorist financing, border control, documentation and maintaining a database of terrorist activities. The Center has participated and conducted in various activities, workshops and seminars since its inception. These include the Seminar on Counter-Terrorism conducted in Langkawi, Malaysia in October 2003 in collaboration with Australian Government, and a course on financial underpinnings of terrorism in Southeast Asia, conducted in Kuala Lumpur in April 2004 in collaboration with the United States. The Center has a full schedule of activities to be conducted through 2004 and beyond, including workshops on capacity-building in combating terrorism and a course on fraudulent document detection. Malaysia remains fully committed to the struggle against terrorism. Our efforts to enhance our counter-terrorism capabilities under the auspices of the United Nations are complemented by the collective actions of our partners through multilateral organizations such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Commonwealth and the Non-Aligned Movement. My delegation continues to value the close working relationship that we have established with the Committee and the Monitoring Team, especially at a time when there is a need for greater enhancement of cooperation in our common cause against terrorism.</p>

We consider that encouragement important for us to pursue the outstanding challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa02">There were no questions to me personally, or to the Team coordinator, but there have been many suggestions. We have taken good note of the suggestions and shall be studying them in the Committee. We shall strive to give effect as well to the Team's recommendations, which we have begun to analyse. Possibly, if the Committee so decides, we may come back to the Council, as many delegations have requested this morning, to propose improvements and new measures to combat terrorism. That is not simply a mandate from the Security Council, but ultimately it is an ethical obligation for all of those who want to see a more stable and secure international community.</p>
