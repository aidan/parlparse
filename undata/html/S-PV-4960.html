<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council notes that the presentation of the Kosovo Standards Implementation Plan (KSIP) on 31 March 2004 in Pristina, Kosovo (Serbia and Montenegro), is a step forward in the standards process. The Council reiterates that the KSIP should serve as a basis for the assessment of progress of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) in meeting the standards. The Council in this respect urges strongly the PISG to demonstrate their full and unconditional commitment to a multi-ethnic Kosovo, in particular with respect to the protection and promotion of rights of members of the minority communities as well as of human rights, equal security, freedom of movement and sustainable returns for all inhabitants of Kosovo. The Council reiterates further that the progress by the PISG in meeting the standards, which should be reflected throughout Kosovo, will be assessed periodically and that the advancement towards a process to determine the future status of Kosovo in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> will depend on the positive outcome of a comprehensive review.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms its full support for the 'Standards before Status' policy that was devised for Kosovo and endorsed by the Council in application of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. It recalls in this context the document 'Standards for Kosovo', presented on 10 December 2003 and subsequently supported by the Council in the statement of its President of 12 December 2003, which outlined the standards that are to be achieved in order to reach the goal of establishing in Kosovo a multi-ethnic, stable and democratic society.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council stresses that it is essential, as indicated in the KSIP, to review and revise in a timely manner two key sections of the document, namely on 'sustainable returns and the rights of communities and their members' and on 'freedom of movement'. The Council calls on the PISG to take urgent steps on these two standards in order to rebuild and reach out to the Serb and other communities that suffered most in the large-scale inter-ethnic violence of 17-20 March 2004 that resulted in many dead and wounded and the destruction of personal property and Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council, strongly condemning those events, emphasizes that no party can be allowed to profit or to advance a political agenda through violent measures. It calls on the PISG and all political leaders to take responsibility in the current situation and to ensure that such acts and threats of violence are not repeated. The Council underscores that immediate actions should be taken aimed at the establishment of and public respect for the rule of law, including prosecution of perpetrators, effective collection of illegal weapons and combating organized crime. The Council urges the PISG to take concrete steps to fulfil their commitment to rebuild multi-ethnicity and reconciliation throughout Kosovo, as promised in the open letter of institutional and political leaders of 2 April 2004. The Council asserts further that, in addition, there must be rapid steps taken by the PISG to fulfil their commitment to rebuild or provide appropriate compensation for damaged or destroyed property, to rebuild holy sites and to facilitate the return of those displaced from their homes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"When assessing the progress made by the PISG, the Security Council would pay particular attention to the adoption and the implementation of laws and regulations, policies and attitudes of the PISG, among others, in the following areas: the fight against discrimination, corruption and economic crimes; propagation of hate by the media, as well as the support for multi-ethnicity and reconciliation; genuine devolution; orderly and sustainable returns; effective functioning of the Assembly and of the political parties; disciplinary procedures for the civil service; building up of a professional, politically neutral and multi-ethnic administration at central and local levels with a view to providing public services to every community on an equal footing; efficient strategy for the return of refugees and internally displaced persons in safe conditions; a constructive engagement with UNMIK; and full participation in the direct dialogue with Belgrade.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council underlines the importance that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, within his authority as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, inter alia in the context of the review mechanism, continue to consult closely with interested parties, in particular the Contact Group. The Council reaffirms its intention to continue to consider the regular reports of the Secretary-General, including an assessment from the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, as to the PISG's progress towards meeting the standards. The Council takes note that the Contact Group intends to make a substantive contribution to the regular reviews and to submit its assessments to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General, in his next report to the Council, to include a comprehensive assessment of the violence of 17 to 20 March 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council also requests the Secretary-General to present recommendations on possible new institutional arrangements respectful of the objective of building a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo to allow more effective local government through devolution of central non-reserved responsibilities to local authorities and communities in Kosovo, taking into account relevant studies and recommendations of interested parties and international organizations. How that local Government is organized is a matter for further discussion between interested parties in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council welcomes the strong measures by the international presence in Kosovo aimed at enhancing the security and protection of all communities, as well as their religious, historical and cultural sites, with the goal of ensuring lasting stability in Kosovo. It calls, in this respect, for the full cooperation of the PISG and all concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council will continue to follow the matter closely."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-13.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/13</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">Before concluding the meeting, I would like to welcome the Secretary-General to this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
