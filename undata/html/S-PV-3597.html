	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Sierra Leone, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-975.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/975</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council has considered the Secretary-General's report of 21 November on the situation in Sierra Leone (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-975.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/975</a>). It is deeply concerned at the conflict in that country, and at the suffering resulting from it, in particular that of the nearly two million internally displaced Sierra Leoneans. It calls for an immediate end to the fighting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his offer of good offices in Sierra Leone and urges the Revolutionary United Front to take advantage of that offer, thus enabling both parties to enter into negotiations. It thanks the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for his efforts to that end, in close coordination with the Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth, the Economic Community of West African States, and other organizations and neighbouring States supporting the negotiations and the process of democratization in Sierra Leone, and welcomes the Secretary-General's decision that his Special Envoy's mission should continue for the time being.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council stresses the importance it attaches to a coordinated international effort to alleviate the humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone. It welcomes the Secretary-General's efforts in this regard and his initiative in preparing, in collaboration with the Government of Sierra Leone, an action plan for the demobilization and reintegration of combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council underlines the need for generous humanitarian assistance in a situation in which nearly half the population of the country have been internally displaced, and calls upon Member States to provide such assistance. The Council commends those humanitarian agencies active in Sierra Leone. The Council deeply deplores attacks on humanitarian convoys and demands that those responsible cease such actions immediately.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council welcomes the programme of transition to democratic constitutional rule set by the Government of Sierra Leone, which is crucial to the restoration of peace and stability in that country. It expresses its strong support for the work of the Interim National Electoral Commission (INEC) in preparing for the elections to be held on 26 February 1996. It welcomes the assistance being given by the United Nations to the INEC at the request of the Government of Sierra Leone, and calls upon Member States to provide the fullest possible material and financial support to the INEC in order to ensure the success of the elections, with the broadest possible participation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council urges the Secretary-General to continue to monitor closely the situation in Sierra Leone."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-57.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/57</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
