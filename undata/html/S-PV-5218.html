	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2005-320.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/320</a>, which contains the special report of the Secretary-General on elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council takes note of the joint decision reached by the two houses of the Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 17 June 2005 to extend for a period of six months, renewable once, the transitional period that was to expire on 30 June 2005, in accordance with the provisions of the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement signed in Pretoria on 17 December 2002 and with article 196 of the Transitional Constitution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council calls on all Congolese parties to respect this decision, which aims to allow the elections provided for by this Agreement to take place in satisfactory logistic and security conditions. It encourages the Congolese people to mobilize for and conduct the electoral process in a peaceful manner, and urges in particular the candidates and political parties to refrain from any action that might disrupt this process. It takes note in this regard of the recommendation contained in the special report of the Secretary-General on elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo dated 26 May 2005 (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-320.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/320</a>) that all political parties should sign and commit themselves to respect the agreed code of conduct for the electoral process. The Council urges all parties and transitional institutions to make every effort to respect scrupulously the timetable for polls developed by the Independent Electoral Commission, and in particular to begin preparations for the referendum on the draft constitution as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes progress made so far in the preparation of the elections, in particular the adoption and promulgation of the referendum law, and the start of voter registration in Kinshasa, which marks a historic and important step in the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Council calls on the transitional authorities to accelerate those reforms remaining to be carried out, in particular drafting of the electoral law and integration of the security forces.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council underlines the importance of elections as the foundation for the longer-term restoration of peace and stability, national reconciliation and establishment of the rule of law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It calls upon the Congolese authorities to exercise efficient, transparent and comprehensive control over State finances, ensuring that there is no impunity for those responsible for acts of embezzlement or corruption. In this regard, the Council encourages the Congolese authorities to continue consultations with their international partners, in full respect for the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to put in place credible arrangements to strengthen support for good governance and transparent economic management."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-27.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/27</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
