I am sure I speak for all members of the Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Listre for the great diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council's business last month.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">If Council members will allow me, at this point I would like to convey the following. Yesterday, Her Excellency Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh called my delegation to convey her congratulations on our assumption of the presidency. She asked me personally to convey to all the Council members her greetings, as well as her full support and her Government's full support in the discharge of our responsibilities. She has encouraged us to continue our work to promote international peace and security and a culture of peace worldwide.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">I should like to recall that at its 4075th meeting, on 30 November 1999, the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1278(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1278 (1999)</a>, by which it decided that the election to fill the vacancy in the International Court of Justice should take place on 2 March 2000 at a meeting of the Security Council and at a meeting of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">This afternoon the Security Council and the General Assembly will proceed independently with the election, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Statute of the Court, for the purpose of filling the vacancy which occurred on 29 February 2000 owing to the resignation of Judge Stephen Schwebel (United States of America).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">The list of nominations of the candidates by national groups of States parties to the International Court of Justice Statute is contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2000-106.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/106</a> and addenda 1 and 2.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">I should like to remind the Council that, under Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"Those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of votes in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">The required majority in the Security Council is eight votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">Article 15 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice provides that</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"A member of the Court elected to replace a member whose term of office has not expired shall hold office for the remainder of his predecessor's term."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">Accordingly, the member elected to fill the remainder of the term left vacant by the resignation of Judge Schwebel will serve until 5 February 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The voting will be held by secret ballot. When we proceed to the vote, members of the Council will receive a ballot paper containing the name of the candidate. No withdrawal will be accepted once the ballot papers have been distributed. However, it would be possible to withdraw between ballots. Members of the Council will be requested to place an "X" in the box next to the name of the candidate for whom they wish to vote. Votes may be cast only for a candidate whose name appears on the ballot paper.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">I should like to remind members of paragraph 15 of the Secretary-General's memorandum, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2000-105.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/105</a>, which specifies that</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"Each elector may vote for only one candidate."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">Any ballot paper containing votes for more than one name will be considered invalid. When a candidate has obtained the required majority of votes, I shall communicate the result to the President of the General Assembly, and I shall request the Council to remain in session pending the receipt from the President of the General Assembly of the result of the voting in the Assembly.</p>
