	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Somalia, <a href="../pdf/S-2001-963.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/963</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">"The Security Council, having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 11 October 2001 (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-963.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/963</a>) and having held a public meeting on 19 October 2001 (<a href="../html/S-PV-4392.html">S/PV.4392</a> and <a href="../html/S-PV-4392.html">S/PV.4392</a> resumption 1), reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia, consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and bearing in mind its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its support for the outcome of the Arta peace conference, the establishment of the Transitional National Assembly and the Transitional National Government. It encourages the Transitional National Government to continue, in the spirit of constructive dialogue, the process of engaging all groups in the country, including in the north-eastern and north-western areas, with a view to preparing for the installation of permanent governance arrangements through the democratic process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa06">"The Security Council believes that the Arta peace process continues to be the most viable basis for peace and national reconciliation in Somalia. It urges the Transitional National Government, political and traditional leaders and factions in Somalia to make every effort to complete, without preconditions, the peace and reconciliation process through dialogue and involvement of all parties in a spirit of mutual accommodation and tolerance. It calls on all parties to refrain from actions that undermine the Arta peace process. The Council emphasizes that while the search for a national solution continues, unwavering attention must be paid to achieving local political settlements as well.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its support for the Transitional National Government's ongoing efforts to enhance security in the Mogadishu area and to make operational the National Commission for Reconciliation and Property Settlement, which should be independent, as foreseen in the Transitional National Charter. The Council emphasizes the necessity for efforts against international terrorism in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September 2001 and welcomes the stated intention of the Transitional National Government to take steps in this regard. The Council urges the international community, including through the Counter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, to provide assistance to Somalia for the implementation of the aforementioned resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa08">"The Security Council calls on the concerned States in the Horn of Africa to contribute constructively to the peace efforts in Somalia. It emphasizes that the situation in Somalia and the objective of long-term regional stability can most effectively be addressed if neighbouring States play a positive role, including in the process of rebuilding national institutions in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa09">"The Security Council acknowledges Djibouti's major contribution to the Arta peace process and welcomes its continued role in this regard. It encourages the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the Organization of African Unity/African Union and the League of Arab States to enhance their efforts to promote peace in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa10">"The Security Council calls on all States and other actors to comply scrupulously with the arms embargo established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-733(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 733 (1992)</a> of 23 January 1992. The Council insists that all States, in particular those of the region, should not interfere in the internal affairs of Somalia. Such interference could jeopardize the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa11">"The Security Council insists that the territory of Somalia should not be used to undermine stability in the subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa12">"The Security Council strongly condemns the attack of 13 October 2001 on a police station in Mogadishu, in which a number of officers and civilians were killed. It reiterates its condemnation of the attack on 27 March 2001 on the compound of Médecins sans frontières in Mogadishu and the subsequent abduction of international personnel, and demands that those responsible be brought to justice. The Council notes that these attacks were launched at the same time as the consideration of a possible United Nations peace-building mission for Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa13">"The Council emphasizes that no measure of violence can alleviate the plight of the Somali people or bring stability, peace or security to their country. It calls for an immediate end to all acts of violence in Somalia. Deliberate acts of violence should not be allowed to prevent the rehabilitation of Somalia's governing structures and the restoration of the rule of law throughout the country. In this context, the Council condemns the leaders of those armed factions who remain outside the peace process and continue to be obstacles to peace and stability in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa14">"The Security Council expresses concern about the humanitarian situation in Somalia, in particular in southern areas and in the Bay, Bakool, Gedo and Hiran regions, due to the expected food insecurity and lack of rainfall in the October-December period. It draws attention to the urgent need for international assistance, inter alia, in covering food and water shortfalls, thereby also combating potentially further destabilizing stress migration and prevalence of disease. Noting that problems in livestock exports have also been a major influence in worsening the economic and humanitarian situation, the Council calls on all States and on all authorities within Somalia to cooperate in efforts to allow the resumption of such exports.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa15">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction that the United Nations, the Red Cross movement and non-governmental organizations continue to provide humanitarian and development assistance to all areas of Somalia. The Council calls upon all parties in Somalia to respect fully the security and safety of personnel of the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations, and to guarantee their complete freedom of movement and access throughout Somalia. The Council calls on Member States to respond urgently and generously to the United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for 2001, for which only 16 per cent of the identified needs have been financially provided thus far.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa16">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to take the following steps in support of the peace process in Somalia:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk06-pa17">(i) Dispatch a headquarters-led inter-agency mission to carry out a comprehensive assessment, based on the existing general United Nations standards, of the security situation in Somalia, including in Mogadishu;</blockquote>

	<blockquote id="pg002-bk06-pa24">(b) facilitating exchange of information; and</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk06-pa25">(c) finding ways and means of drawing attention to Somalia's needs related to national reconciliation and development.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa26">"The effort to achieve the objectives stated in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above should have a focus in the region and include close interaction with IGAD and its Partners Forum (IPF), the Organization of African Unity/African Union, the League of Arab States and the Security Council;</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk06-pa27">(vi) Intensify, through urgent contacts with donor countries and relevant non-governmental organizations, the efforts for humanitarian and development assistance in Somalia; and</blockquote>
