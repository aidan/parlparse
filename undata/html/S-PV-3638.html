	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in Haiti, <a href="../pdf/S-1996-112.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/112</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">The first speaker is the representative of Haiti, on whom I now call.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lelong</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The Haitian delegation is pleased, Madam, to note the ability, commitment and success with which you are guiding the deliberations of the Security Council as its President for the month of February. Without question, these all bear the mark of your experience and skill; we congratulate you.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">As this is our first statement to the Security Council this year, we wish also to congratulate the new members: Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the Republic of Korea. We are certain that they will do excellent work as members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The delegation of Haiti thanks the Security Council for taking under consideration the request made by President René Préval in his letter dated 9 February 1996 for a further extension of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). Extending the mandate will make it possible to consolidate the achievements that have been made and to guide the country towards the economic and social development to which the people of Haiti aspire. Continuing the work of UNMIH will encourage the completion of this task through the Mission's support for our new national police force as it gains the experience it lacks and as it continues to acquire the equipment it still needs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Since its deployment on 31 March 1995, taking over from the multinational force, UNMIH has carried out its mandate with success and excellence. Thanks to its support for the Government, it has been possible to get the country back on track and to begin the task of rebuilding our institutions and our infrastructure, which had been completely destroyed during the three years of the <i>coup d'état</i>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Politically speaking, a great deal has been achieved since the restoration of constitutional order, which has made it possible to look with optimism towards the political future of the country. We have been successful in our effort to make up the backlog which the three years of the <i>coup d'etat </i>caused in the political calendar of our country. Legislative, municipal and presidential elections have been carried out normally. Today, whether in Parliament or in the towns of the country, the transfer of power provided for by the Constitution has been respected, and the leaders, honestly and democratically elected, are performing to general satisfaction.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">For the first time in the long history of our country, a democratically elected president has transferred power to another democratically elected president. The inaugural ceremony, which attracted the attention of the entire world because of its size and its scope, was the culmination of the efforts of the Haitian people and the international community to provide Haiti with a democratic regime.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">Parliament, which has been reconstituted after the elections of June and September, is playing the role assigned to it by the Constitution, and it is therefore an important factor on the national political scene. The members of Parliament and senators of the Republic take their responsibilities to heart and do not hesitate to request an accounting from the executive branch on the way it is conducting public affairs. The public debate that is taking place on important matters is a dynamic impulse to political life and creates transparency, which is so necessary for confidence and for participation in the work of reconstruction and rehabilitation undertaken in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">Regarding the struggle against lack of security which was the main obstacle to the resumption of normal public life and activities, major progress has been achieved. Thanks to the strengthening of the role of public security forces, with the assistance of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, (UNMIH), security has improved. The fear that reigned in the country is now disappearing. The population feels much more confident with the more and more visible presence of the National Police.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Nevertheless, the situation in matters of security remains precarious. Indeed, there are serious risks of disturbances. This was made evident by the attack against two deputies of the Lavalas Movement, one of whom was killed and the other seriously wounded. Violent demonstrations, which caused more than seven deaths and many wounded, broke out spontaneously throughout the country as a result of that act. Likewise, we have seen practically everywhere demonstrations protesting the high cost of living and popular clamours over the persistence of certain economic problems. These expressions of discontentment are a matter of concern for the Government, which is trying to give an adequate response to these outbreaks of violence. In this connection, the role played by the National Police in maintaining security is of paramount importance. The creation of that institution, which is enshrined in the Constitution, has filled in a very important gap.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">Today, our young policemen, who are deployed throughout our nine geographical departments, are carrying out remarkable work. This has won the admiration of the populace. They ensure public security, organize patrols, direct traffic and generally assist the population. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that there are certain shortcomings and limits to this newly created body. The policemen still need more experience to be able to perform better their duties. Likewise, the material and equipment they require are lacking, and there is a deplorable lack of training. The Government is paying particular attention to all these points in the hope of finding a solution to them in order to make it possible for the National Police to fulfil successfully its role as the guardian of peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">As far as the judiciary is concerned, despite the improvements in its functioning, it continues to exhibit serious deficiencies. It is obvious that of all the institutions in the country, its structure, functioning and essence are perhaps the most eroded, as was the case in earlier periods. For that reason, it has never responded properly to the requirements of justice for the national majority. Hence, it has been discredited and there has been a tendency to resort to popular justice to punish political crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">The creation of the Justice Academy, for that reason, is a measure of great importance. More than 200 judges and prosecutors trained at the Academy, as well as 50 bailiffs are now active. The Government thus intends to provide our courts with more qualified personnel, more capable of performing their functions. At the same time, a programme of renovation and construction of the courts is under way throughout the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">The Government has also given attention to the problems of the prison system. Steps have been taken to ensure that the prisons, both as regards their functioning and their state of physical repair, are more in accordance with established norms. A new National Penitentiary Administration, the members of which have undergone a training course, are now in charge of the prisons. This has resulted in an improvement in the conditions under which prisoners are held.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">One can see, in the light of this account -- which is not an exhaustive one, by any means -- over the last 16 months, Haiti has undergone sure and positive evolution, which the Security Council, having authorized the sending of the United Nations Mission, must welcome. Nevertheless, the work is far from complete. The battle for democracy has not been completely won. A long road has been travelled, undoubtedly. Important and meaningful results have been achieved. But elements likely to cause disturbances and to reverse the trend towards progress continue to exist.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">The Government is indeed deeply worried by the activities of former military personnel and armed civilians who are very close to the former Haitian army and who disturb public order and constitute a threat to the democratic process under way. It is clear that the enemies of democracy and the state of law have not given up. The appearance of the so-called red army in Cité Soleil could disquiet the population. This group, which seems to have certain links with the drug trade, is responsible for certain disturbances in this heavily populated part of the capital in recent months.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">In this context, the departure from Haiti of the UNMIH forces, scheduled for 29 February, would leave a considerable void in the country, which our young National Police, still inexperienced and underequipped, would not be able to tackle properly. This is why President Préval has, as one of his initial official acts, requested the extension of UNMIH's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">We believe that the presence in Haiti of UNMIH for a further period should make it possible for the democratic process to take root and gain strength with the strengthening of our institutions. To leave Haiti now, when a great deal still remains to be done, would only imperil all the efforts made by the international community in aid of the Haitian people, aid which has begun to give striking results. My delegation hopes that the Council will understand the need for and the soundness of this request and will authorize UNMIH to continue its activities in Haiti by adopting the draft resolution now before it.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">In this connection, the delegation of Haiti would like to express its gratitude to those delegations that have supported this request. We would particularly like to thank the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti, and the Non-Aligned caucus in the Council -- particularly its coordinator, Ambassador Somavía -- for their tireless efforts to help Haiti, as well as the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, which has always supported us in our struggle for the return of democracy to Haiti and which also deserves our gratitude. We would also like to extend our sincere thanks to the delegations of the People's Republic of China and of the Russian Federation for their understanding and their support.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">In conclusion, I should like to express the gratitude of the people and the Government of Haiti to the Secretary-General and to his Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, for their dedication to Haiti. We would like to express our gratitude to those countries that have agreed to provide troops and civilian personnel. Finally, we would like to pay tribute to those brave soldiers who have laid down their lives in this Mission so that democracy can once again flourish in Haiti.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Haiti for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fulci</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union and of the following associated countries that wish to join with it in this statement: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The Security Council's adoption of the resolution to renew the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) will represent a positive step towards further consolidating Haitian democracy and institutions. The European Union has repeatedly emphasized the need for the Haitian situation to evolve in such a way as to assure stability, security and peaceful coexistence for all members of Haitian society, fostering economic growth and allowing that country to reap the benefits of the efforts made by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">The election of President Préval was a decisive moment. As the European Union has stated, this made possible the transfer of office from one democratically elected President to another for the first time in Haiti's history. On that occasion, the European Union expressed its confidence that President Préval will complete, in a framework of national reconciliation and justice, the work that his predecessor undertook in difficult conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The Secretary-General's report of 14 February notes the new President's request for the Council to take appropriate steps with a view to bringing about an extension of UNMIH's mandate so that a gradual withdrawal may take place in the months ahead. This request deserves a positive response. The draft resolution proposing the extension of UNMIH's mandate is particularly welcome, as it is in the spirit of completing a process that began with such difficulty.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">A positive outcome for the Haiti operation relies also on it being possible, over the next few months, for the various sectors of the population to be made aware that there is no better solution to their country's problems than properly functioning democratic institutions and full respect for human rights. In fact, as has been said on many occasions in the Council, the final outcome of this peace-keeping operation remains in the hands of the Haitian population.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">However, it is important to recognize the significant roles played by regional cooperation in solving the Haitian crisis. Of the factors that have led to the success already achieved, the initiatives undertaken by the Organization of American States and its close cooperation with the United Nations have certainly contributed to today's results.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">The Secretary-General's report notes the elements of fragility in the creation of an efficient, modern judicial system and an adequate civilian police force. The need for a renewal of UNMIH's mandate is specifically based on such considerations. But we trust that this further commitment of resources by the United Nations at such a critical moment for the financial situation of our Organization will also convey to international public opinion the message that the United Nations has a unique and irreplaceable role.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I should like to welcome to our meeting the Permanent Representative of Haiti to the United Nations and ask him to convey to the people of Haiti our wishes for peace and for their success. We are also grateful to him for his kind words addressed to my country.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">The Russian Federation attaches great importance to the success of the democratic transformations in Haiti. We support the efforts by the legally elected President, Mr. René Préval, and by the people and the Government of Haiti, to strengthen democracy and the rule of law in their country.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">Russia has always taken the uniqueness of the Haitian problem as a given. In essence, the events in Haiti did not and do not threaten regional peace and security. Nevertheless, the Security Council, to accommodate the Government of Haiti and taking into account the exceptional circumstances in that long-suffering tried country, did agree to establish a United Nations peace-keeping operation there.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">Since then, the process of stabilizing the situation in Haiti has been forging ahead. In this, the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) has been an enormous help: the Mission's personnel deserve the highest praise. Democratic elections have been successfully conducted and there has been a peaceful transfer of power to the new President, a fact which, incidentally, is welcomed in the draft resolution before the Council today. UNMIH's fundamental goals had already been achieved by February this year, and that is why we originally had it in mind to wrap up UNMIH as soon as 29 February was past, which the Council too had also earlier decided to do.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">We are convinced that only a substantial improvement in the social and economic situation in a situation of national reconciliation can create the right conditions for a democratic, stable and secure Haiti to develop. In terms of outside support for these processes, the deciding factor will be stimulating and coordinating the efforts by the specialized agencies of the United Nations, the international financial institutions and the bilateral donors that are providing Haiti with the assistance they have promised.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">We do agree that, at this stage, it is also important to provide support for the Haitian national police force that has just been established, as described in detail by the representative of Haiti today. Keeping personnel from the United Nations civilian police in Haiti will help with this.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">At the same time, it is no secret that we do have doubts about the advisability of continuing the presence in Haiti of a large United Nations military contingent.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">We note with satisfaction that, during the work on the draft resolution, the sponsors took many of our amendments into account and planned for a significant cut in the Mission and for a further review of personnel numbers. However, the main thing is that the text clearly and unambiguously states that what we have here is absolutely the last extension for UNMIH.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">The Council's appeal to all States to provide appropriate support to the United Nations in fulfilling UNMIH's mandate is of great significance. We expect that the principle that peace-keeping operations are financed partly on a voluntary basis will be given real meaning through this, and that this will somewhat alleviate the extremely difficult financial state of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa10">It is of particular importance that the members of the Council supported Russia's proposal and reflected in the draft resolution the need to shift the centre of gravity of the international presence in Haiti towards solving Haiti's extremely acute social and economic problems. Turning the words in the Council's appeal into actual deeds by the multilateral and bilateral donors would be the best kind of support the Haitian people could have.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa11">It is precisely on this point that we think that we should concentrate, together with the Government of Haiti and the friends of Haiti, especially Haiti's neighbours and those other States with a direct interest in the region's well-being.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa12">Taking all these factors into account, we shall support the draft resolution. We have a feeling of satisfaction because, as a result of constructive and sometimes difficult labour and by establishing an equilibrium between the interests and positions of all the members of the Council, we have succeeded in producing a consensus, generally acceptable solution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wibisono</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The Indonesian delegation has followed with events in Haiti with interest, and in this regard we are grateful to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report, which has indeed been invaluable to the Council's deliberations on the future of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH).</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">UNMIH has proved to be another United Nations success story. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 940 (1994)</a> clearly spells out its mandate: to assist the Haitian Government in maintaining a secure and stable environment, to protect the Government of Haiti and key installations, to assist in the holding of elections and to professionalize the security forces. These aims have been largely achieved. In less than one year after UNMIH took over from the multinational force, it has achieved some truly impressive goals. Moreover, due to the assistance provided by UNMIH and the international community, Haiti has had free legislative, local and presidential elections.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">On 7 February 1996, Haiti achieved an important milestone in experiencing its first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected President to another since independence in 1804. My delegation believes that these elections have been a positive development in the consolidation of Haiti's democracy. In this regard, we give special thanks to Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi for his leadership, which helped to ensure the success of UNMIH. We would also like to pay tribute to the men and women of UNMIH for their brave and dedicated work in securing peace and stability in Haiti under difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">The Indonesian delegation believes that much of the success in Haiti can be attributed to a unique combination of peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building efforts. In this connection, my delegation stresses the importance of sustained humanitarian and technical assistance, along with financial commitments on behalf of the international community. It is also in this context that we applaud the efforts undertaken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, along with eight United Nations agencies, for their valuable contributions to the implementation of the emergency economic recovery programme, while paying particular attention to the developmental aspects of their activities.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">It is also my delegation's view that internal security and economic development in Haiti will remain elusive without a strong system of justice. In this regard, we are pleased that major advances are being made in the creation of a professional Haitian National Police Force, in its prison system and in judicial infrastructure.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">Despite the considerable progress that has been achieved towards national reconciliation, democratic rule and reconstruction in Haiti, my delegation cautions against unbridled optimism. The simple fact remains that much still needs to be accomplished before sufficient momentum in the development of Haiti's institutions is established. The fragile nature of stability is made evident by the recent reports of looting, arson and common crime that have occurred in various parts of Haiti. My delegation is also concerned with reports of deteriorating economic conditions, including a depreciating currency, higher unemployment and underemployment, rising inflation, a decline in private investment and revived instances of capital flight.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Haiti stands at a crossroads. While significant progress has been made since its return to a constitutional Government, challenges persist. The first obstacle that must be surmounted is the smooth transition of power, which we deem to be a prerequisite for sustaining both internal and international confidence. Additionally, we note that at this time the National Police Force is not adequately trained or fully operational, which is a vital aspect for moving Haiti away from its turbulent past and pointing it in the direction of political stability, lasting democracy, constitutional order, economic prosperity and national reconciliation. In both these instances the presence of UNMIH has had a qualitative impact.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">After careful consideration, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before the Council, which calls for the final extension of the UNMIH mandate. We feel that the new Government of Haiti and its people will significantly benefit from the additional assistance provided for in this draft resolution. Above all, we cannot fail to note the request made by the President of Haiti to the Secretary-General for the continued presence of UNMIH for some months. However, given the tremendous financial burdens placed on the United Nations, we support the idea that interested countries should make every effort to provide voluntary contributions in order to assist the United Nations in financing UNMIH.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">Furthermore, in consideration of recent developments in Haiti, we believe that the emphasis of UNMIH personnel should be directed towards bolstering the Civilian Police Force to reflect more accurately and compensate for the changing nature of Haiti's security needs and present condition.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">In this context, therefore, my delegation underscores the importance of transferring tasks from UNMIH to the Government of Haiti so that they will be adequately prepared fully to assume responsibility for their security and stability at the conclusion of this mandate. We stress, however, that while UNMIH, with the generous support of the international community, has made a profound contribution to easing the harsh humanitarian conditions in Haiti and assisting in building its institutions, the ultimate responsibility for achieving lasting national reconciliation and reconstruction resides with the people of Haiti.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Legwaila</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Madam President, in this twilight of your presidency, the Botswana delegation takes great pleasure in saluting you and your record of achievement as President of our Council during this very long month of February. We thank you for keeping us awake until dawn on Monday and for your tenacity of purpose throughout this hypertensive week. We wish you a restful retirement from the presidency of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) has done a commendable job in assisting the Haitian authorities in sustaining a secure and stable environment, in organizing successful municipal and legislative elections and, above all, in managing the smooth transition from one democratically elected president to another -- no mean feat, given the tortured political history of Haiti. But our most ardent commendations deservedly go to the people of Haiti themselves, who have demonstrated great determination and unity of purpose in rejecting the old oligarchic and despotic rule and embraced a new democratic culture. One might say that UNMIH has done such a wonderful job that it has put itself out of a job. Yet a lot still remains to be done in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Almost everything in Haiti hinges on the question of the security situation in the country: the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law, foreign and domestic investment and economic development generally would thrive only if peace and security were assured in the country. It is true that today there is no major direct internal threat to the security of Haiti and that Haiti does not pose a threat to regional peace and security, thanks to the efforts and presence of UNMIH. But Haiti still has to grapple with the building of the state of law and an effective judiciary. There still remains bitter opposition in many of Haiti's small political parties, in the wealthy and powerful elite and in remnants of the former Haitian army and paramilitary groups.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">In other words, the democratic process and the continued existence of a secure and stable environment in Haiti need a formative or maturation period much longer than we could have foreseen. Small problems such as those that exist in Haiti today can become large and unmanageable tomorrow if they are allowed to fester. What we are calling for is a "mop-up action", as they say, such as a good general would undertake after a successful battle.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Botswana therefore supports the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti until we can be relatively certain about the security situation in the country.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martínez Blanco</span> <span class="nation">Honduras</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa01">Since October 1994, when former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to Haiti, the international community has seen progress achieved in that country in strengthening its democracy and institutions, goals towards which the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) has made a significant contribution.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa02">Indeed, the presidential elections held in December 1995 were an essential element in the consolidation of constitutional order in Haiti. However, some aspects related to the internal security and economic and social development of that country remain unresolved. In Haiti, enormous social and humanitarian problems must still be faced, the roots of instability and insecurity eradicated and the achievements of democracy shored up.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa03">One of the most sensitive aspects in Haiti is the question of internal security and common crime. Despite the progress that has been made in the training of police personnel and the provision to them of some equipment, with the assistance of several States and the cooperation of UNMIH, much remains to be done to ensure that Haiti has a sufficiently large and properly trained and equipped police force.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa04">We therefore call on the States Members of this Organization to continue to contribute the financial and technical resources necessary to establish a professional Haitian National Police force. Similarly, contributions must be made to improve the prison and judiciary systems, which, according to the Secretary-General's report, are in a critical situation and lack the infrastructure and equipment necessary for normal functioning.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa05">Another important aspect for the consolidation of democracy in Haiti that my delegation wishes to stress, and which was correctly identified by various financial institutions in December 1995, is the indissoluble link in Haiti between security and development. In recognizing that principle, many institutions have affirmed that the main objective of United Nations system's involvement in Haiti should be to alleviate poverty, that to ensure sustainable development, better governance is needed and the environment must be protected and regenerated.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa06">In truth, to ensure development in Haiti, it is important for international economic cooperation to continue, because the island's socio-economic prospects remain weak. It is encouraging to know that the Bretton Woods institutions, the Inter-American Development Bank and the European Union will pursue the negotiations with the new Government that were initiated in January this year on a set of structural adjustment measures that are crucial to the Haitian economy.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa07">We must recognize that, thanks to the activities of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, it has been possible to maintain a climate of stability in the country, as witnessed in the peaceful and orderly transfer of power to the new President, René Préval.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa08">My delegation feels that the continued United Nations presence in that country is necessary to consolidate the progress achieved and to assist the Haitian Government in fulfilling its obligations to maintain conditions of security and stability and to establish a professional Haitian National Police force, activities that are set out in the Secretary-General's "An Agenda for Peace" and its supplement as post-conflict peace-building measures. We therefore agree that UNMIH's mandate should be extended.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa09">We hope that the adoption of the draft resolution before us will be accompanied by a renewed commitment on the part of the people and the Government of Haiti to peace, democracy and national reconstruction, because in the final analysis they are the architects of their own destiny.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Park</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">With the change of guard taking place in several hours, let me add the voice of my delegation to that of the Ambassador of Botswana in praising the outstanding achievements under your leadership, Madam President, in the month of February, which you characterized as the "longest shortest month" of the year.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">For their valuable efforts, my delegation would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, his Friends for Haiti and troop- contributing countries of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) to bring security and stability to Haiti. Our special thanks to Mr. Brahimi, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his commendable dedication and leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Although Latin America and the Caribbean moved towards the general trend of politico-economic liberalization in the post-cold-war era, Haiti was one of the few unfortunate exceptions. With the help of the international community, however, considerable progress has been made in the restoration of democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Among the positive steps which have been taken since the extension of UNMIH's mandate seven months ago, the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected president to another through free elections -- to which the Ambassador of Haiti so proudly referred in his statement -- marks a watershed in the political development of Haiti. We congratulate the Government and the people of Haiti on this monumental feat and sincerely hope that the Haitian Government will continue to consolidate the achievements in this field.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Much of this progress can be attributed to the valuable contributions of UNMIH, which has facilitated Haiti's path to democracy by sustaining a secure and stable environment and providing indispensable support to the Haitian Government and its people. Indeed, through the commitment and hard work of its staff, UNMIH has successfully carried the peace-keeping operation over into post-conflict peace-building, thereby realizing one of the key concepts of "An Agenda for Peace".</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">I would also like to note that the Haitian experience has demonstrated the imperative need for close cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. Needless to say, the activities of this world body can be most effective when strongly supported and assisted at the regional level. By the same token, regional endeavours are most fruitful when reinforced by the support of the global community. My delegation considers that the close collaboration between UNMIH and the Organization of American States (OAS) has brought optimal benefits to the peace-keeping efforts in Haiti, as in the cases of Georgia and Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">As of now, however, the situation in Haiti is still tenuous and requires continued vigilance by the international community. In particular, long-term stability in Haiti requires the establishment of a fully functioning police force capable of independently maintaining law and order and a far-reaching reform of the judicial system. We have attached marked importance to the institution-building process in Haiti and have particularly recognized the urgent need for adequate resources to equip the Haitian police. It is in this context that Korea has already donated $200,000 to the United Nations Trust Fund for the Haitian Police created under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-975(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 975 (1995)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">The socio-economic problems plaguing Haiti deserve equal attention. As noted in the preamble of the draft resolution, economic development is an integral element for securing a lasting peace in Haiti. Simply put, without food and jobs for the people, peace and security cannot be guaranteed. Now that the political situation has begun to stabilize, the international community should place increased focus on the economic and social development of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">It is in this spirit that my delegation welcomes the long-term financial commitments of the Bretton Woods institutions and United Nations development agencies to the economic reconstruction of Haiti. We are likewise pleased to note that 16 Latin American and Caribbean countries under the sponsorship of the Latin American Economic System and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are negotiating 144 development cooperation projects with the Haitian authorities. We also look forward to the firm commitment of the Haitian Government to carrying out economic reforms which will create an environment conducive to further inducing foreign investment and assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">It is evident that the people of Haiti bear the ultimate responsibility for their own destiny. However, in order to sustain the momentum of the ongoing process of democratization and economic and social stabilization in Haiti until the Haitians can assume direct and sole responsibility for their future, we support the continued presence of UNMIH for a period of four months with a reduced troop level of 1,200, as provided for in the draft resolution. For these reasons, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wlosowicz</span> <span class="nation">Poland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Let me also say how impressed I am, Madam President, by your performance as the President of the Security Council, and that despite all the complex time- and energy-consuming debates you thought of us on Valentine's Day. Thank you very much.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">At the outset allow me to point out that the Polish delegation associated itself with the statement on Haiti delivered by the Italian delegation on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">It was with great hope that we welcomed on 7 February 1996 the first democratic presidential succession in Haiti's turbulent history.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">We acknowledge the enormous tasks that the duly elected President is faced with, and we judge his request for a further extension of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) to be particularly well grounded.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">We strongly believe that such an extension would contribute to strengthening the fragile institutions of Haitian democracy and to making the Haitian Government more functional. It would allow the UNMIH forces to complete the work that they have embarked upon, and thus it would enable the Government of Haiti to profit fully from the efforts of the international community to lift Haiti out of political, social and economic destitution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">Since lasting democracy requires the solid foundation of law, the process of building a functioning judicial system and a professional civilian police force in Haiti is of paramount importance for the future of that country. In this respect, the assistance of the United Nations Mission in Haiti continues to be indispensable, and it is precisely for this reason that the renewal of the UNMIH mandate is specifically aimed at giving the new Haitian National Police more time to gain experience and at attending to the revitalization of Haiti's system of justice. Since these are principally peace-building tasks, we think that the extension of the UNMIH mandate may also be regarded as a useful exercise in the transfer from mainly peace-keeping to essentially peace-building activities of United Nations operations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">A successful completion of the operation in Haiti is badly needed -- most of all by its people, who have suffered so much and who have just been given more than hope. The success is also needed by the international community, which has desperately tried to help the Haitian nation at a time of dramatic transition.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">And lastly, we, the United Nations, need a democratic and properly functioning Haiti among us. This is still to quite an extent a matter of our responsibility and -- also very important -- of our credibility. We have an excellent chance to show the world that the United Nations is effective in a difficult and sensitive area of maintaining international peace and security, and we must not miss that chance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">The Polish delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us. We want to emphasize that the burden of the tasks assumed by UNMIH must not be underestimated. I would like to express here our sincere gratitude to the Governments of those States that have already contributed and that will contribute their troops to the operation in Haiti. They deserve our highest praise.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">Like previous speakers, I wish to congratulate you, Madam President, on the wisdom, skill and great patience with which you have conducted our work during the month of February.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">First of all, my delegation wishes to express its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his report on the progress achieved during the fulfilment of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), which describes the main events that have taken place in Haiti since the submission of the preceding report on 6 November 1995 and which contains an assessment of the results achieved by the United Nations, as well as recommendations on the role that the Organization should continue to play in order to consolidate the gains in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">Allow me, through you, Madam President, to pay a tribute to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide for the authority and wisdom with which he committed his country to the path of democracy. My delegation would be remiss if it let pass this opportunity to offer President René Préval our best wishes for success in the accomplishment of his tasks. Our praise and admiration go also to the Haitian people for their exemplary attitude, which was a determining factor during the elections. My delegation also expresses its gratitude to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and to the members of UNMIH for their commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">My country welcomes the Secretary-General's current report, which some contains very positive and encouraging elements regarding the United Nations Mission in Haiti and congratulates UNMIH for the progress achieved during the fulfilment of its mandate, as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>, to assist the Haitian Government in maintaining a safe and stable climate, to protect international personnel and essential installations, to ensure the desired conditions for the holding of elections and to create a new professional police force.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">My delegation is firmly convinced that the Haitian Government and people bear prime responsibility for the political, economic and social reconstruction of Haiti. However, it wishes to stress that the continued support of the international community is essential to ensure that lasting peace and stability are established in that country. In this regard, we ask the international community to continue to provide its support to the Haitian people so that it can make a real commitment to the way of democracy, peace, tolerance and prosperity, essential conditions for any lasting economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">We support the Secretary-General's recommendation to extend UNMIH's mandate because we feel that now more than ever the Haitian people needs the presence of the United Nations to consolidate the progress achieved, and, therefore, the withdrawal of UNMIH could compromise the process of democratization under way.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Elaraby</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa01">I would like at the outset to express my thanks to the Secretary-General for his report, which gives a positive picture of the situation in Haiti and a clear indication that the United Nations has brought about a sure success, whether in terms of the lessening of tension and acts of violence or in terms of beginning to establish the institutions required for the building of a modern State.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa02">The United Nations Mission in Haiti has contributed effectively in supporting the democratic changes witnessed in Haiti recently -- which culminated in the peaceful transfer of power to the President-elect, René Préval -- in establishing the pillars of a newborn democracy and in assisting the Haitian Government to maintain security and stability in a transitional period. In this connection, my delegation would like to commend the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, who has shown his usual wisdom, vision and leadership skills.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa03">Egypt's position <i>vis-à-vis </i>this draft resolution stems from the close relationship between the social and economic development badly needed in Haiti and the importance of the international presence there, which reflects the importance of maintaining stability in the country. Egypt's position is based on our belief in the inalienable right of developing countries to be given assistance whenever they so require. If a developing country sends an S.O.S. to the United Nations asking for an international presence to protect and maintain security on its territory, it is very important, from our point of view, that this should be approved.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa04">On this basis, Egypt supports the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Mission for an extra four months in order to support and promote stability and security and to contribute to the training of the Haitian National Police force so that it can assume that role after the mandate ends. Concerning the size of this Mission, Egypt's position reflects our conviction that United Nations peace-keeping operations must have the size and power needed to implement fully their mandates.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa05">In conclusion, I would like to point out that the very delicate balance in this draft resolution is a good basis for the new aspects of the mandate that are set out in paragraph 5. The delegation of Egypt believes that the Council should adopt this draft resolution and that the General Assembly should take up its role in post-conflict peace-building so that, receiving appropriate international support for its efforts in the areas of social and economic development, Haiti can reap the rewards of this endeavour.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Qin Huasun</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk06-pa01">The Chinese Government has all along attached importance to and supported the peace process in Haiti, as well as the positive efforts made by the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, the Organization of American States, Latin American countries and the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) in restoring peace and stability in Haiti, and we hope that the Haitian people will soon be able to live in happiness and peace. It is in this spirit that the Chinese delegation has voted in favour of an overwhelming majority of the resolutions on this question that have been adopted by the Council so far.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk06-pa02">We are pleased to note that substantive progress has been made in the Haitian peace process, thanks to the help of the United Nations and the international community. Parliamentary, local and presidential elections in Haiti have concluded smoothly. The President-elect has officially taken office. The task of creating a police force in Haiti has been completed. The security situation in Haiti has also improved markedly. The primary task now facing Haiti is rehabilitation and reconstruction. The question of security is undoubtedly important for Haiti's development. However, both the maintenance of a secure environment and economic development can ultimately depend only on the Haitian people themselves. The help of the international community in the process can play only a supplementary and promotive role. In this regard, other United Nations bodies and some countries can play a proper role. At the same time, considering precedents in other United Nations peace-keeping operations and the current serious financial difficulties of the United Nations, we believe that the United Nations Mission in Haiti should withdraw as scheduled.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk06-pa03">However, considering the recommendation of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, the request of the Haitian Government and the attitude of the Latin American and non-aligned countries on the question of UNMIH, the Chinese delegation exercised maximum flexibility during the Council's consultations and did its best to find a compromise proposal. In view of the fact that the draft resolution before us has basically incorporated the amendments by the Chinese delegation, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk06-pa04">The Chinese Government will, as always, support the peace process in Haiti and is ready to establish and develop friendly relations of cooperation with Haiti on the basis of the United Nations Charter and the five principles of peaceful coexistence. We are convinced that the Haitian people, under the leadership of their new President, His Excellency Mr. Préval, will be able to build Haiti into a peaceful, stable and prosperous country, thus making their contribution to peace and development in Latin America and the world as a whole.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gomersall</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa01">My delegation is equally unanimous, Madam: in congratulating you on this success at the end of your presidency this month, and in thanking you for your most warm and effective conduct of our deliberations during this extremely busy and somewhat eventful month.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa02">My delegation would also like to express its respects and welcome to the representative of Haiti, who sits at the Council table today, and to congratulate him on the successful achievements which he outlined to us.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa03">The story of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) has been a notable success for the United Nations. The Secretary-General and his Special Representative, those Member States which have given particular assistance to the process, and the Government and people of Haiti are to be congratulated on the progress which has been achieved. Elections have been held, and power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected President to another. In all this, the contribution of the United Nations has been vital and imaginative, embracing the promotion both of stability and of development in one of the world's poorest countries.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa04">But, as this resolution makes clear, there is still much for UNMIH to do. Its mission is now at a delicate stage. Security and stability have yet finally to be assured. There is more work to be done, particularly in relation to the National Police force.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa05">It is for these reasons that my Government strongly supports this resolution. Indeed, we would have supported even more strongly a resolution more in line with the recommendations of the Secretary-General and with the wishes of the primary troop contributors and of the Government of Haiti. We have found it difficult to understand some of the problems which have been raised over the strength of the force and the duration of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa06">We pay a particularly warm tribute to the Government of Canada for the lead that it has taken in making UNMIH's continuation possible. It is a source of great satisfaction to my delegation that UNMIH will now be able to continue its mission into the stabilization phase.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa02">I welcome the representative of Haiti to the Security Council. I salute the clarity of his statement and I am particularly grateful to him for having kindly made mention of me personally.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa03">I thank the Secretary-General for his positive report on the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). My delegation congratulates all the members of the team that worked on it. We sincerely echo the words of praise in the final two paragraphs of the report for all those who participated in and contributed to the success of the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa04">As other representatives have said, for the first time in the history of Haiti there has been a change of Government and of President through a democratic electoral process declared by international observers to have been clean, impartial and peaceful. This unprecedented event was made possible by the firm support of the international community for the efforts of the people of Haiti and of the legitimate authorities of that country. The crucial role of the United Nations has been unanimously recognized, as has the fact that this has been among the most successful operations carried out by this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa05">The new extension of the mandate of UNMIH, which Chile supported, is a clear indication of the Security Council's interest in the great political advances achieved in Haiti and of its determination to continue to support and consolidate the ongoing peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa06">Haiti has become, along with Costa Rica, one of the two countries in our region to depend solely on internal forces and police for its security and public order. It is therefore necessary to strengthen, train and professionalize the police and to instill in it a culture of democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa07">In this second phase of the work of UNMIH we should lay the groundwork for a fitting transition to and consolidation of a climate conducive to investment and development. We in the Latin American and Caribbean region have made enormous efforts to support Haiti; the report of the Secretary-General makes special mention of this. Regional institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the Organization of American States have also made considerable and sustained contributions. We in the region renew our hope that we will be able to continue our intensive cooperation, with a view especially to building Haiti's ability to make good use of the resources that the international community has made available to Haiti for its reconstruction. We agree with the report of the Secretary-General that special attention must be given to poverty alleviation and to restoring macroeconomic equilibrium.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa08">Let me take note of one important element of the resolution we have just adopted. As members will recall, from the time of the January 1992 meeting of the Security Council at the level of Heads of State or Government, the Council's official concept of peace was no longer the mere absence of armed conflict, but became an integral concept of peace that indissolubly linked its two constituent parts: security and development. In adopting the present resolution, the Council has reaffirmed that concept by</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa09">"Recognizing the link between peace and development and that a sustained commitment by the international community to assist and support the economic, social and institutional development of Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and stability in the country". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-1996-136.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/136</a>, ninth preambular para.</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa10">Another reason for great satisfaction is the fact that the Council's support for Haiti is aimed at restoring democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean -- a primary objective for the countries of our region. International support, in particular from the United Nations system, is critical to the task of consolidating the values and the culture of democracy. To achieve this goal, it is in the economic and social field that the greatest efforts must be made. It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa11">That is why the United Nations cannot consider its mission to be accomplished if there is merely an apparent climate of calm. The Security Council must ensure the continuation of the operations of the system, so that other bodies can undertake economic reconstruction and rehabilitation in an ongoing consolidation of the peace that has been achieved through the transition to democracy in which the country is now engaged.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa12">I want to take particular note of Canada's offer of a significant contingent, which will enable UNMIH to fulfil its mandate. As the representative of Canada has made known to us informally, that contingent will be completely financed by his country, in line with the request in paragraph 11 of today's resolution. Even though Canada has not yet formally advised the Council of this, I want to note that this is the kind of commitment and decision that engenders true belief in what the United Nations stands for. I thank the representative of Canada for what his country has done.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa13">The non-aligned members of the Security Council and all the States of Latin America and the Caribbean expressed in timely fashion the high political priority they attach to a renewed mandate for UNMIH. I therefore wish to thank all the members of the Council that showed the necessary flexibility in order to arrive at this agreement. It was a complex and sometimes intensive process, but I never lost hope that in the end, the collective responsibility of all the members of the Council to respond with vision and with foresight to the needs of the Haitian people would prevail. This is a sign of trust in Haiti; it is a gesture of solidarity with the people of Haiti and a responsible exercise of the authority of the Council and of its individual members. Chile welcomes this decision.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Henze</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">Let me first join other speakers in thanking you, Madam President, for the way in which you have directed the work of the Council in the month of February. You have demonstrated an admirable combination of patience, drive and perseverance, which did not prevent late-night meetings, but which was always successful in bringing about results which could be accepted by all of us.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">We associate ourselves fully with the statement made by Italy on behalf of the European Union. We had strongly supported the first draft resolution, which was presented by the Friends of Haiti and which was in line with the report of the Secretary-General and the request of the Government of Haiti. We are therefore less happy with the final outcome of the informal consultations in the Council. As was stated by other speakers, we know that more time is needed to help create a really stable situation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">Germany believes, however, that the improvements which have been achieved in Haiti could have been jeopardized by an immediate withdrawal of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). That is why we voted for the resolution adopted today despite the misgivings I have expressed.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">In the four months to come, UNMIH will continue to contribute to the maintenance of a secure and stable environment for the rebuilding of the country and to the establishment of a well-trained Haitian National Police to which these functions will be transferred.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">We congratulate the Government of Haiti, whose permanent representative we welcome today in the Council, and the people of Haiti on the progress already achieved, especially in the political field. The first peaceful transition from one democratically elected president to another in the history of the country is one of the positive developments that deserve special mention.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">We are confident that the new Haitian leadership under President Préval will contribute to national reconciliation and the creation of a national consensus that unites all parts of Haitian society in an effort to rebuild and develop the country. A united effort by all Haitians will be indispensable for further substantial progress in the political, economic and social fields.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">It is our sincere hope that UNMIH, even under this limited mandate, will help Haiti in its efforts to stabilize and rebuild the country and to continue on the way towards the establishment of strong democratic structures. My country has actively supported the efforts of the international community to consolidate the democratic order in Haiti. We provided election observers for the parliamentary and local elections in June and September 1995, as well as for the presidential elections in December. Together with our partners in the European Union, and as a member of various international organizations, we are providing economic assistance for Haiti. Bilaterally, we have at present earmarked DM 105 million -- about $72 million -- for economic cooperation with Haiti. The main focus of this cooperation is a food security programme.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">Let me take this opportunity to thank all those countries which are contributing troops to UNMIH. Furthermore, I would like to extend our deep condolences to the Governments and the families of all those who have given their lives to fulfil this important mission. Finally, we are particularly grateful to Canada, which helped find the solution to our problem by making a very generous offer.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dejammet</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">The French delegation is happy for you and for the country you represent because your presidency was marked throughout this month by energy, dynamism, great kindness, understanding and, fortunately, also a good dose of humor. All this has been crowned with success by the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1048(1996).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1048 (1996)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">This outcome is especially pleasant for me because it responds to the request of a country dear to us, Haiti. The Permanent Representative of Haiti expressed this request with great skill and conviction, and we are happy to congratulate him on his first appearance in this forum. The request is proof of Haiti's commitment to democracy, and it also ties in with the United Nations effort to nurture the beneficial effect it has had in Haiti. I think that this success must be highlighted, because it is a success for the Organization, for the Member States, for the Secretariat and also for the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, who has brought to bear in Haiti a degree of energy, doggedness and patience to which we must all pay a tribute.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">This success of the United Nations deserves support because, after the deployment of the multinational force, which allowed for the return of the president to Haiti, the presence of the UNMIH Blue Helmets allowed Haiti to experience, for the first time in its history, a peaceful political transition. It led to the taking of office by the new, democratically elected president, Mr. Préval which we welcomed. It made it possible to maintain a safe and stable environment, and it is this safe and stable environment that we have supported today.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">The role played by the United Nations in Haiti could have been completed after the presidential elections. But the new President felt that his country needed, for a few more months, the presence of an international force that would maintain security and stability and, especially, as the representative of Haiti quite rightly pointed out, to continue the training of the police. The resolution we have just adopted responds to that request. It is the expression of the international community's continuing solidarity with Haitians, which we welcome.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">The resolution provides for the deployment of contingents and policemen. It requests all States to provide appropriate support for the actions undertaken by the United Nations and its Member States pursuant to this resolution to ensure the implementation of the mandate, as set out in paragraph 5. In this regard, we are aware of the measures taken by certain States, and France can only take delight in the intentions indicated in this area by the Government of Canada. We congratulate Canada for its generosity.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">France, for its part, will continue to offer the Haitians its full support, primarily by putting a police contingent at UNMIH's disposal, but it will also continue to provide Haiti with economic assistance which, together with the aid from the international community -- and we all hope that this will be the case -- will enable Haiti to continue along the path of progress and development.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I thank the representative of France for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">Let me join those who have welcomed the representative of Haiti to our midst for this very important occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">Today, the Council marks another milestone in Haiti's journey from tyranny to democracy. The United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) has helped to ensure a climate of security within which free elections could be held and a new President inaugurated. For the first time in Haiti's history, political power has been transferred from a President elected by the people to a new President also elected by the people, without violence and with respect for democratic principles. That is an advance for freedom and stability throughout this hemisphere, and I was delighted to represent President Clinton at that historic event. The joy was palpable, and the spirit of hope evident. We congratulate both President Aristide and President Préval on this remarkable occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">Today, in response to the request of Haiti's new President, René Préval, we have approved an extension of the United Nations Mission. By this decision, the international community renews its support to Haitian security and stability and continues its much-needed assistance to the newly trained, newly deployed Haitian National Police. This will allow the Haitian Government to consolidate and expand further its recent political, social, and economic advances.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">The resolution builds on the progress that has already occurred in Haiti. The United Nations Mission will be reduced by more than two thirds, in both its military and in its civilian police components. The Secretary-General is instructed to begin planning, no later than June, for the mission's withdrawal. The Security Council's role and the need for military peace-keepers in Haiti is coming to an end, but it has not ended yet. The resolution approved today is designed to help finish the job, and during the next four months the United States will welcome recommendations from the Secretary-General on further ways that the international community can contribute to Haiti's development, democracy and security.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">We should not forget that, through much of Haitian history, the official outposts of authority -- the military headquarters and police -- have been used not to enhance the security of Haitian citizens, but to deprive them of it. A new era has now dawned: Haiti's Government is committed to providing justice to all its citizens, and we welcome that commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">But an effective and professional national police cannot be invented overnight. Today, the most experienced of the National Police trainees has only eight months on the job: the police need more time. The continued presence of a modest number of United Nations peace-keepers will help provide that time and thus reduce the likelihood of violence and disruption.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa09">My Government is heartened by the decision of Canada to offer itself as a candidate for a leadership role in the next phase of the United Nations Mission. We also welcome the call in operative paragraph 11 of the resolution for voluntary contributions for the Mission to fulfil its mandate. We urge every Member to assist in appropriate ways.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa10">We also urge nations and the relevant international institutions to continue efforts on behalf of the emergency economic recovery programme. The door to private investment must be open: the future of democratic Haiti depends on an economic programme that recognizes and rewards the initiative of Haiti's people. In advance, we express our appreciation to all those who will rise to the occasion and give the Haitians a continuing helping hand. We are especially grateful to the Canadians for their generous and instant comprehension of what was needed to assure success.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa11">The value of the resolution we have approved today is also reflected in the unanimous support for it demonstrated by all western hemisphere States. This demonstration of regional support for a democratic transition is in the best tradition of inter-American cooperation, and it reflects the fact that events in Haiti have had and continue to have consequences beyond the borders of that country.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa12">The Security Council may be proud of its role in helping Haiti help itself. With the assistance of the dedicated personnel of UNMIH, and especially with the outstanding job done by Mr. Brahimi, the Haitian people have fashioned an astonishing triumph of hope.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa13">We must remember, though, that this victory is not final; it is not yet complete. As the resolution we have approved today recognizes, the future of Haiti rests, as it must, in Haitian hands. Democratic institutions cannot be imposed upon a society; they must be nourished from within. The road ahead remains uphill, but the international community can be satisfied that those with the commitment to build a free Haiti now have that opportunity. By allowing that chance, the Council has kept faith with the people of Haiti and with the Charter's pledge</p>
	<blockquote id="pg015-bk02-pa14">"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa15">I resume my function as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa16">The representative of Canada has asked to speak. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">As this is my first opportunity to address the Security Council during February, allow me to congratulate you, Madam President, on the way your presidency has unfolded. I know that, as a result of your capable guidance, the Council has carried out its tasks in a fruitful and effective manner. Allow me also to offer my congratulations to the representative of the United Kingdom, Ambassador Weston, on the way he guided the Council's deliberations during January.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">Canada has watched the Haitian people with admiration as it passed one of the most important milestones in its progress towards democracy. On 7 February, contingent on the 17 December elections, the Haitian people made possible a transfer of power from one democratically elected President to another. This is a success of which all Haitians can be proud.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Canada has sought to take advantage of all possible opportunities for it to show proof of its commitment to helping the Haitians along their road to peace, prosperity and stability. We have provided technical, material and financial assistance, and have taken an enthusiastic part in all United Nations efforts aimed at bringing peace and stability into the daily lives of the Haitian people. Our commitment will be maintained as Haiti continues with its development.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">While marking the achievements to date, we must also measure the steps still to be taken. We welcome the two letters from President Préval to the Secretary-General requesting the continuation of a United Nations and an international presence through the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) and the International Civilian Mission to Haiti (MICIVIH). Canada is committed to ensuring that democracy in Haiti is deeply rooted.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">In this regard, I am pleased to join many others in offering praise and appreciation to Special Representative Brahimi, whose outstanding diplomatic skills and quiet competence have contributed so much to the success of the United Nations engagement in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">We do believe that there is a continuing role for the international community which will extend far beyond the length of UNMIH's or MICIVIH's specific mandates: Haiti is engaged in a long-term process of institution-building, economic reconstruction and the rehabilitation of its justice system. We all, as members of the international community, continue to play an important role in assisting the Haitian Government in this process. While our commitment may take many forms, these are not undertakings which can be arbitrarily or summarily concluded. It is therefore incumbent upon us to ensure that the focus of the international community remains clearly fixed on Haiti so that Haiti may overcome its legacy of violence and injustice.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">We consider it important that the negotiation of this resolution has once again drawn our attention to the importance of our continuing to learn the lessons of previous peace-keeping missions. Canada has consistently insisted that mandates, and the resources deployed in support of those mandates, cannot be considered separate and unrelated issues. The resource requirements detailed in the relevant reports of the Secretary-General are not arbitrary figures. Rather, they reflect the best military advice available to the Secretary-General and must be given due consideration by the Council in adopting enabling resolutions. When the Council fails to heed such advice, significant risk is necessarily incurred, sometimes with disastrous consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">Specifically, the issue of force size and troop levels seemed to be the determining issue in the negotiation of this resolution. As a significant troop contributor to peace-keeping operations over nearly five decades, Canada has often stressed how essential it is that the United Nations learn from its past peace-keeping record and accept that peace-keeping missions must be adequately resourced. The very legitimacy of the United Nations's peace-keeping vocation will be put at risk if sufficient resources are not made available to accomplish the mandates which the Security Council sets for those missions.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">The Secretary-General's military advisers and potential troop contributors to a renewed but significantly reduced UNMIH assessed that a contingent of 1,900 would be the minimum viable force required to accomplish UNMIH's mandate with an acceptable degree of risk to the United Nations personnel involved.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">This force, at 9 per cent of the size of the multinational force which intervened in September 1994 to establish a stable and secure environment, and one third the size of the currently mandated UNMIH, was designed to be of sufficient strength to be capable of executing the military mission it was being assigned, and no more. The mission included both maintaining a visible United Nations presence throughout the country and providing for the security of United Nations personnel and other designated persons, including, of course, the crucially important Civilian Police.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">UNMIH, with its Civilian Police component, is an example of a small, tightly organized, broad-based Mission focused specifically on the problems of instability and the need to buttress the fledgling judicial apparatus in Haiti. UNMIH has been engaged in assisting Haitians with the peaceful reconstruction of their society. This, in our view, is an entirely appropriate role for the United Nations to play.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">Canadians have steadfastly stood by the Haitian people in their struggle to build a democratic society; to this end, Canada is committed to a significant contribution to a reduced and extended UNMIH.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">Given the strength of our determination not to abandon Haiti at this critical stage, the Canadian Government has decided, pursuant to paragraph 11 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1048(1996).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1048 (1996)</a>, to make available, entirely at our own expense, additional military personnel that we consider necessary to enable to enable UNMIH to fulfil its mandate with an acceptable degree of risk to the personnel involved.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa11">We would very much have preferred the Secretary-General's recommendations for the extended force to have been accepted by the Council in their entirety. This is a collective United Nations responsibility, and it should be organized and resourced accordingly. However, given the alternative of no force at all and the prospect of leaving Haiti without any United Nations support at a critical juncture in Haiti's political development, the Canadian Government decided to bridge the gap between what the Council could agree and the Secretary-General's requirements.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa12">We must stress however, that from our perspective -- and we have every reason to believe that the Government of Haiti is entirely comfortable with this position -- the Canadian troops which will complete the force envisaged in the Secretary-General's report will work closely with United Nations forces in the context of a unified force. We intend to enter into an agreement with the United Nations that will place our additional troops under the command and control of the commander of UNMIH, and we anticipate that our additional troops will follow the same rules of engagement and be afforded the same protection as that part of the force which will be funded by United Nations general assessment.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa13">Canada has taken the step of offering additional troops because of our commitment to Haiti and our concern that United Nations credibility not be jeopardized once again. It is clearly not an ideal arrangement and not one that we see as providing a model for future United Nations peace-keeping. We continue to believe firmly that all Member States should, through assessed contributions, help shoulder the burden of maintaining international peace and security. That said, the interests of the people of Haiti have caused us to set aside those important considerations in an effort to ensure an effective United Nations Mission in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa14">In closing, I would like to register my appreciation for the kind words which you, Madam President, and many members of the Council have addressed to the Canadian Government in response to its undertaking to send additional troops to Haiti to assist with the maintenance of a secure and stable environment.</p>
