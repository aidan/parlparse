<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), documents <a href="../pdf/S-1996-248.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/248</a> and Add.1.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General of 4 April 1996 on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-248.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/248</a> and Add.1) pursuant to paragraph 21 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1045(1996).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1045 (1996)</a> of 8 February 1996.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council notes that some progress has been achieved during the past two months in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, although it has been limited and has not fulfilled the hopes generated by the meeting between President dos Santos and Dr. Savimbi in Libreville, Gabon, on 1 March 1996. The Council stresses the importance it attaches to the full implementation of the Protocol. The Council reminds President dos Santos and Dr. Savimbi of their commitments and urges them to take the necessary actions to move the peace process forward.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council notes that the União Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA) has quartered more than 20,000 of its forces, but expresses concern over delays in the quartering of UNITA troops and urges UNITA to move expeditiously to achieve full quartering of its troops. The Council expresses concern about the quality of weapons surrendered by UNITA and urges UNITA to fulfil its commitment to turn over all of its arms, ammunition and military equipment as the quartering process continues. It reiterates that the quartering process is a crucial component of the peace process and stresses the need for quartering to be credible and fully verifiable. The Council expresses its concern at the statements made by Dr. Savimbi on 13 March 1996 and 27 March 1996. In this context, the Council urges all Angolan leaders to consider carefully the effect of public statements on the climate of confidence necessary to nurture the peace process. It also urges UNITA to release all remaining prisoners.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council recognizes with satisfaction the progress by the Government of Angola in the implementation of its commitments under the Lusaka Protocol and the current timetable, and encourages the Government to continue this progress. The Council emphasizes the importance of completion of the Calendar of Actions for April, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the continuation of the pull-back of government forces from areas near UNITA quartering sites, the return of the Rapid Reaction Police to barracks, the resolution of the question of amnesty for UNITA officials, and the adoption of a plan to disarm the civilian population, as well as the quartering of UNITA troops. The Council encourages the two parties to complete the integration of UNITA into the Angolan armed forces.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council also encourages the Government to grant UNAVEM III the requisite facilities for the establishment of an independent United Nations radio.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council stresses its concern at the extensive presence of landmines throughout Angola and expresses support for the efforts of the United Nations, the Government and non-governmental organizations to address this problem. The Council urges the Government and UNITA to destroy their stockpiles of anti-personnel landmines. It encourages them to make a meaningful public gesture towards destruction of landmines which could have a positive effect on public confidence and the free circulation of people and goods.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council notes with concern credible reports of continuing purchases and delivery of weapons to Angola and considers that such actions are contrary to paragraph 12 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-976(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 976 (1995)</a> of 8 February 1995 and undermine confidence in the peace process. The Council reaffirms the obligation of all States to implement fully the provisions of paragraph 19 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a> of 15 September 1993.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council emphasizes that the ultimate responsibility for restoring peace rests with the Angolans themselves. The Council reminds the parties that extension of the mandate of UNAVEM III will be based, to a large part, on progress by the two parties towards meeting the goals set by the Lusaka Protocol.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council condemns the incident on 3 April 1996 which resulted in the death of two UNAVEM III personnel, the wounding of a third and the death of a humanitarian assistance official, and reiterates the importance it attaches to the safety and security of UNAVEM III and humanitarian assistance personnel. The Council notes the cooperation offered by the Angolan Government and UNITA with the investigation by UNAVEM III of this deplorable incident.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council reiterates its gratitude to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the staff of UNAVEM III, and the three observer countries whose unflagging service to the cause of peace has been outstanding. The Council will continue to monitor the situation in Angola closely and requests the Secretary-General to continue to keep it informed of progress in the Angolan peace process."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1996-19.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1996/19</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
