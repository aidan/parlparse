The Committee adopted, without a vote, draft resolutions A and B contained in paragraph 8 and a draft decision which appears in paragraph 9. The Fourth Committee recommends their adoption to the General Assembly.</p>

The Committee's decision relating to Gibraltar is also set out in the report.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa17">In adopting these proposals, the General Assembly would, among other things, reaffirm the inalienable right of the people of those Territories to self-determination and independence and state that it is ultimately for the people of those Territories themselves to determine freely their future political status in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The Fourth Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the related draft proposals, contained in paragraph 29.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa18">On behalf of the Fourth Committee, I should like to recommend these reports to the attention of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa19">Before concluding, I wish to express my deep appreciation to the Chairman of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), Ambassador Francis Kirimi Muthaura of Kenya and the two Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Niall Holohan of Ireland and Mr. Jalal Samadi of the Islamic Republic of Iran, for their guidance and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa20">I should also like to express my gratitude to the members of the Fourth Committee for the cooperation they extended to me during the session. I also wish to thank the Secretary of the Committee, Mr. Ozdinch Mustafa and his colleagues, Mr. Khan and Ms. Fritsche, and other Secretariat members of the Committee for their cooperation and assistance, which facilitated my tasks as Rapporteur of the Fourth Committee and for which I am grateful.</p>

	<p id="pg016-bk05-pa01">The General Assembly will now continue its consideration of the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as a whole, under agenda item 18.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk05-pa02">The Assembly has before it the report of the Special Committee (<a href="../pdf/A-50-23.pdf" class="nolink">A/50/23</a>) and a number of related documents, as listed in the <i>Journal</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Attar</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa01">As the Rapporteur of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration of the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, I have the honour to present to the General Assembly for its consideration the report of the Special Committee covering its work during 1995 (<a href="../pdf/A-50-23.pdf" class="nolink">A/50/23</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa02">The report, which relates, <i>inter alia, </i>to agenda item 18, is submitted in accordance with paragraph 10 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-89.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 49/89</a> of 16 December 1994, on the implementation of the Declaration, by which the Assembly requested the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and to carry out those actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that had not yet exercised their right to self-determination and independence, and in particular to formulate specific proposals for the elimination of the remaining manifestations of colonialism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa03">At its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly, in adopting <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/181</a>, entitled "International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism", and the Plan of Action, mandated the Special Committee to undertake a series of activities during the Decade, including the organization of similar activities in the Caribbean and Pacific regions alternately.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa04">During the year the Special Committee was able to discharge the task entrusted to it by the Assembly and submit appropriate recommendations on all the items referred to it for consideration and report. Meeting between February and August and holding extensive consultations throughout the year among its members, and bearing in mind in particular the specific request addressed to it by the General Assembly in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-89.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/89</a>, the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the path of decolonization and facilitating the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa05">In addition, the Special Committee submitted recommendations specifically relating to activities of foreign, economic and other interests which impede the implementation of the Declaration, military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration, the implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations and information transmitted under Article 73 <i>e </i>of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa06">We note here that the Special Committee devoted considerable attention to the decolonization of the small island Territories. In that connection, the Special Committee was especially mindful of the fact that the United Nations visiting missions had provided effective means of assisting and ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the peoples regarding their future status in those small Territories. Accordingly, it once again stressed the importance of dispatching such missions to colonial Territories in order to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration. In that respect, the Committee will continue to seek the full cooperation of the administering Powers in ensuring that visiting missions to Territories under their administration can be undertaken.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa07">On the question of the publicity to be given to the work of the United Nations in the field of decolonization and as reflected in chapter III of its report, the Committee again reiterated the importance of effecting the widest possible dissemination of information on decolonization as an instrument for furthering the purposes and principles of the Charter and the provisions of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It also reiterated its importance for mobilizing all public opinion in support of the peoples of colonial Territories in their efforts to achieve self-determination, freedom and independence, bearing in mind the important role being played by non-governmental organizations in the decolonization process and in the dissemination of information on the situation on all the remaining small island Non-Self-Governing Territories. The Special Committee requested the departments concerned to continue their cooperation with those organizations in the dissemination of information on decolonization issues and to provide support to the peoples of those Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa08">During the year, in the light of the constructive results achieved, and in keeping with related decisions of the General Assembly, the Committee decided to continue to maintain close contact with the organizations concerned, and to participate in the related conferences arranged by those organizations as well as by other United Nations bodies. The objective of those contacts was to facilitate the effective implementation of the decision of the various United Nations bodies and to foster cooperation between the specialized agencies and the regional organizations in their assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories in the respective regions.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa09">I should like to draw members' attention to the proposals outlined in chapter I, section J, entitled "Future work", in order to enable the Committee to proceed with the effective discharge of the tasks that remain to be completed. The Special Committee recommended that the General Assembly renew its appeal to the administering Powers concerned to take all necessary steps for the implementation of the Declaration and the relevant United Nations resolutions in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. In that connection, the Special Committee, bearing in mind the useful results achieved as a consequence of the active participation of the administering Powers in its work, recommended that the General Assembly again urge the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to cooperate with the Committee in the discharge of its mandate and in particular to participate actively in its work relating to the Territories under their respective administration.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa10">The General Assembly may also wish to renew its appeal to all States and to specialized agencies and other organizations within the United Nations system to comply with the various requests addressed to them by the United Nations in its resolutions on the question of decolonization.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk06-pa11">On behalf of the Committee, I commend the report to the attention of the General Assembly. Before concluding, permit me to express to all the members of the Special Committee -- and in particular to Ambassador Alimamy Pallo Bangura of Sierra Leone, the Acting Chairman of the Committee, Ambassador Humberto Rivero Rosario of Cuba, the Vice-Chairman, Ambassador Utula Utuoc Samana of Papua New Guinea, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions, Information and Assistance and Mrs. Cecilia Mackenna of Chile, the Rapporteur of the Subcommittee -- my deep gratitude for their cooperation and support. I also thank Mr. Abdur-Razzaque Khan, Mrs. Johanna Fritsche, and other associated members of the Secretariat for their assistance, which facilitated my task as Rapporteur. Allow me to pay special tribute to Mrs. Fritsche for her exemplary service to the United Nations, in particular to the Special Committee on decolonization, which she has served with great devotion for over 30 years. Now that she is retiring from the United Nations, I salute her for her dedication to the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I call on the Acting Chairman of the Special Committee, His Excellency Mr. Alimamy Pallo Bangura of Sierra Leone, who will, in the course of his statement, introduce <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.45.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.45</a> and the draft resolution contained in Part II, chapter III, paragraph 9, of the report of the Special Committee (<a href="../pdf/A-50-23.pdf" class="nolink">A/50/23</a>).</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bangura</span> <span class="nation">Sierra Leone</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">It is an honour for me to address the Assembly as Acting Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">At the outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election to preside over the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. My warm felicitations go also to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, on the efficient manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-ninth session.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">A few weeks ago, at the start of the general debate in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) on the item on decolonization, I had the privilege of making a statement in my capacity as Acting Chairman. In that statement, I drew the attention of the members of the Committee to the mandate entrusted to the Special Committee since its establishment in 1961. I also emphasized the progress achieved since then by the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">In the same vein, I should like first of all this morning to refer to the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which declares, <i>inter alia, </i>that:</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">"1. The subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights, is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">"2. All peoples have the right to self-determination; by virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">"3. Inadequacy of political, economic, social and educational preparedness should never serve as a pretext for delaying independence.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">"4. All armed action or repressive measures of all kinds directed against dependent peoples shall cease in order to enable them to exercise peacefully and freely their right to complete independence, and the integrity of their national territory shall be respected.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">"5. Immediate steps shall be taken in Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories or all other Territories which have not yet attained independence, to transfer all powers to the peoples in those Territories, without any conditions or reservations in accordance with their freely expressed will and desire, without any distinction as to race, creed or colour, in order to enable them to enjoy complete independence and freedom." <i>(resolution 1514 (XV))</i></p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">The Declaration, which was adopted without a dissenting vote, was an expression of the world's desire to speed up the liberation of colonial peoples. It gave new hope of freedom and independence to millions still living under colonial rule.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">A year after the adoption of the Declaration, the General Assembly established the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">The Special Committee was asked, <i>inter alia, </i>to continue to seek the most suitable ways for the speedy and total application of the Declaration to all Territories not yet independent; to propose specific measures for the complete application of the Declaration; to submit to the General Assembly a report with recommendations on all Territories to which the Declaration applied, which included Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories, and to apprise the Security Council of any developments in those Territories which might threaten international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">The mandate of the Committee is examined every year by the General Assembly after it has reviewed the Committee's report.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa14">Since its establishment, the Committee has carried out its mandate faithfully. Over the years, it has diligently and methodically pursued its task of reviewing the situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories, hearing petitioners, sending visiting missions to Territories, disseminating information on decolonization with a view to mobilizing public opinion, and making suggestions and recommendations on the progress and extent of the implementation of the Declaration in its reports to the General Assembly and the Security Council, as appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa15">The Special Committee on decolonization has scored outstanding success in the promotion of the exercise by the peoples of the colonial Territories of their fundamental right to self-determination. However, contrary to the belief in certain quarters, this noble mission, as set forth clearly in its mandate, remains unaccomplished. The Committee, in tune with the times, has constantly reviewed its approaches and rationalized its method of work, appropriately adjusting to changing circumstances and improving its efficiency, keeping in step with the whirl of developments in international relations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa16">More recently, particularly with the end of the bipolar world, the Special Committee on decolonization has been noticeably practical, flexible and innovative in its work, as reflected in its recommendations to the General Assembly. However, the Committee has remained conscious of its responsibility and has never lost sight of the interests and welfare as well as the specific needs of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, which have always been and remain paramount. The continuing process has gained renewed impetus since 1991, when the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/181</a>, entitled "International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism", and a plan of action aimed at ushering in, in the twenty-first century, a world free of colonialism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa17">While the General Assembly has repeatedly reaffirmed that such factors as area and population size or remoteness should not prevent the peoples of the Territories from exercising freely their right to self-determination and independence, it is not unaware of the fact that complete decolonization by the year 2000 will require innovative and realistic solutions which can be achieved only with the cooperation and active participation of the administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee. It is for this very reason that the Special Committee has spared no effort, as I have already indicated, in pursuing pragmatic and innovative approaches to the issues of decolonization, even as it adheres firmly to the time-honoured principles of the United Nations Charter and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa18">Paying close attention to the specific needs of each of the Territories, and recognizing the importance of the views of the people concerned and of the territorial Governments, the Special Committee has always encouraged their participation in its work and adopted constructive measures to facilitate that participation.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa19">Acknowledging that the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, many of which are small island Territories, suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as their size, remoteness, geographical dispersion, vulnerability to natural disasters, lack of natural resources, and migration, particularly of people with high-level skills, the Special Committee has assiduously concentrated its efforts within the context of the International Decade on the search for specific measures which will promote the development of these Territories. To this end, the Special Committee continues to seek the cooperation of the administering Powers and the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa20">Realizing the importance of achieving the goals of the United Nations in respect of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Special Committee has sought unremittingly over the years to obtain the cooperation of the administering Powers. Now, in the context of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism by the year 2000, such cooperation has gained added significance, particularly in view of the conviction that visiting missions are important in facilitating the work of the Committee as a means of obtaining first-hand information on colonial Territories and as a means of ascertaining the wishes of the people.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa21">All this is a reaffirmation of the fact that the Special Committee is adjusting to changing circumstances in an ever changing world, and the Committee is very much aware that its task is not yet complete. In recognition of this unfinished task, the Special Committee will continue to endeavour to achieve self-determination for the peoples of the Territories, with the hope that the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories will soon be able to determine their status.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa22">In this context, I should like to refer to <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.45.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.45</a> entitled "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", sponsored by Algeria, Chile, Cuba, India, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone, the Syrian Arab Republic, Trinidad and Tobago and Zimbabwe, and the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-50-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/50/23</a>, Part II, chapter III, paragraph 9, on the dissemination of information on decolonization.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa23">In line with a practical and innovative approach to the work on decolonization, the texts of the draft resolutions have been somewhat modified from last year's texts in that, while not compromising the interests of the colonial peoples and of the Territories, some of the old usages have been changed to wording that will encourage everyone, including the administering Powers, to adopt the draft resolutions without a vote. I therefore commend the resolutions to the Assembly this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa24">In conclusion, let me join the Rapporteur in expressing my profound appreciation to all the members of the Special Committee, to the Secretariat and to everybody else.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rai</span> <span class="nation">Papua New Guinea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I wish to compliment the Chairman of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, Ambassador Francis Muthaura, the Permanent Representative of Kenya, and his Bureau for the expeditious manner in which they have guided the work of the Committee to its efficient conclusion of the agenda items allocated to it by the General Assembly. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ambassador Bangura, the Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone who, in his capacity as Acting Chairman, has ably guided the work of the Committee of 24 during the year. My delegation also wishes to express its gratitude to the Secretariat for furnishing the Committee with the various reports before us and also to pay tribute to the many petitioners who have made presentations before the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">My delegation fully subscribes to the statement by the Acting Chairman of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee on the ongoing concerns of the Committee in fulfilling its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">Since the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/181</a> of 19 December 1991, entitled, "International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism", which, <i>inter alia</i>, proclaimed the decade 1990- 2000 as the decade in which colonialism would be eradicated, my delegation, as an active member of the Committee of 24 and current Chair of the Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions, Information and Assistance, has been concerned that, with the exception of New Zealand, the administering Power of Tokelau, all other administering Powers of these small Territories have noticeably absented themselves from the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">This lack of cooperation from the administering Powers was clearly demonstrated when substantial amendments were introduced in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee by some administering Powers with regard to resolutions emanating from the Special Committee, and in particular on the Committee's omnibus resolution <a href="../pdf/A-AC.109-2035.pdf" class="nolink">A/AC.109/2035</a>, without due consultation with the members of the Special Committee of 24. While my delegation welcomes all proposals to improve the work of the Special Committee, it must register its regret at the demonstrated inability of administering Powers to undertake the normal process of dialogue to reach common consensus at the appropriate Committee levels.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">These actions demonstrate to my delegation that the bypassing of the Committee of 24, which has a Subcommittee dealing with the small Territories, is a clear indication of a lack of will on the part of administering Powers to collaborate with the Special Committee in order to reach common consensus and to expedite a successful conclusion of the responsibilities given to the Special Committee by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">Therefore, in that regard, my delegation urges all administering Powers to work closely with the Committee, given the fact that the current membership wishes to ensure that the Committee's work is progressive, innovative and responsive to the realities of the new international order in relation to special social, economic and political conditions pertaining to the Territories under consideration, and that we do so within the mandate of the Charter and the relevant General Assembly resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">The onus is on the Assembly to fulfil its responsibilities under the Charter, in order that people everywhere will live in an environment freely determined by their own political will. To achieve that goal, this Assembly must fulfil its own resolutions to eradicate colonialism by the year 2000 and usher in a twenty-first-century world free from colonialism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa08">The world is watching the United Nations, whose one area of success is decolonization. Therefore, the United Nations must complete the process of decolonization by the year 2000.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Acting President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01"> We have heard the last speaker in the debate on this item for this morning. We shall now proceed to consider <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.45.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.45</a> and the draft resolution contained in Part II, chapter III, paragraph 9, of the report (<a href="../pdf/A-50-23.pdf" class="nolink">A/50/23</a>) of the Special Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">I shall now call on a representative who wishes to make a statement in explanation of vote before the voting. May I remind delegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. DeCotiis</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">The United States deeply regrets that the two draft resolutions on decolonization considered directly in plenary -- on dissemination of information on decolonization and on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples -- both perpetuate an approach to decolonization that has, quite simply, outlived its usefulness.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">The United States has praised the success of the United Nations in bringing a full measure of self-government to hundreds of millions of people in scores of Territories throughout the world since the Second World War. We support fully the principles of decolonization that led to that success and take seriously our obligations under the United Nations Charter to promote to the utmost the well-being of the inhabitants of the Territories under United States administration.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Support for those principles, however, does not extend to support for resolutions that do not recognize the reality in Territories whose people, in exercising their right to self-determination and thereby achieving a full measure of self-government, have long since made clear their satisfaction with their relationship with the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">Recognition in the third preambular paragraph of the other draft resolution on decolonization of the need for</p>
	<blockquote id="pg021-bk02-pa05">"flexible, practical and innovative approaches towards reviewing the options of self-determination". (<i><a href="../pdf/A-50-23.pdf" class="nolink">A/50/23</a>, Part II, chap. III, para. 9</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">is meaningless if it is not followed by action towards that end. We would certainly welcome such action and would note that the amendments that my delegation proposed to the draft resolution on 12 Territories in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee would have pointed us in the right direction. We are disappointed that the opportunity to move in that direction was lost but were heartened by the closeness of the vote, which we think signalled a recognition that such approaches not only are needed but should be adopted without further ado. Unfortunately, they have not been adopted in the draft resolutions before us today.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">Regarding the draft resolution on the dissemination of information, the United States sees no need for the United Nations to provide information on the options of self-determination to people of Territories who have exercised their right to self-determination. This is especially true at a time when available United Nations resources are best directed at priority needs. In addition, when members of the Special Committee on decolonization themselves would never agree on which Territories should receive such information, we should not accept their assumption that the people of the United States Territories, for example, need that information.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">The aspirations of the people in the United States Territories are clear. A series of plebiscites has given the people of Guam ample opportunity to voice their preference on political status. A Commission on Self-Determination was established in 1988 as the vehicle for the elected Government of Guam to use for discussing a proposal for commonwealth status with the United States federal Government. The Commission will ultimately put into effect legislatively the freely-expressed wishes of the people on this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">In American Samoa, a majority of the Territory's voters and elected officials have seen no reason to change their current political status as an unorganized, unincorporated Territory of the United States. The United States Government makes periodic inquiries through both the executive and legislative branches, offering to enter into discussions on political status or to hold a referendum. The message we have received in response through the years has been consistent: the people of American Samoa are satisfied with their relationship with the United States and see no reason to change it. And in 1993 the people of the United States Virgin Islands voted in a referendum to maintain the status quo in their relationship with the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">The United States remains committed to the principles of decolonization. We urge the members of this General Assembly, however, to consider with us whether those principles apply in the vast majority of Territories under consideration. We also urge the members to consider with us whether these draft resolutions accurately portray the situations in the Territories and whether we need to continue operating through the filter of a Special Committee set up more than 30 years ago under circumstances that simply no longer apply.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">The proud history of United Nations success in the field of decolonization should no longer be marred by resolutions that ignore present-day realities. We would hope that the resolutions and decisions we consider at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly will set the record straight and allow us to focus our efforts on the real problems facing these United Nations.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gomersall</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">Once again, I regret that the delegation of the United Kingdom has found it necessary to vote against the resolutions on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples (<a href="../pdf/A-49-L.45.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.45</a>) and on the dissemination of information on decolonization (<a href="../pdf/A-50-23.pdf" class="nolink">A/50/23</a>, Part II, chap. III, para. 9). This is despite improvements which we recognize in the latter text, in particular the welcome recognition that self-determination does not automatically equate with independence and that there are other options available. The recent referendum in Bermuda illustrates this well. The people there voted against independence and to maintain their existing links with the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">However, my delegation cannot accept that the request for the Department of Political Affairs and the Department of Public Information to publicize decolonization issues is an effective way to spend scarce resources when the Organization is facing a serious financial crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">In the resolution on the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples there remain unfortunately far too many examples of language that is out of touch with present-day reality. For example, we do not accept that the presence of military bases in our dependent Territories could in any way constitute an obstacle to the granting of independence or impede them from expressing their views on self-determination.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">The two draft resolutions submitted to this General Assembly do nothing to advance the wishes and interests of the indigenous people of the remaining dependent Territories, which remain the foundation of the British Government's policies.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">More generally, my delegation recognizes that the United Nations has a positive and cherished record in the area of decolonization, achieved during its first 50 years, and that the principles upheld by this Organization have an enduring validity. We pay tribute to those who have worked successfully and with goodwill in this field, and we shall continue to fulfil our obligations with regard to the situation in the United Kingdom's dependent Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">However, reflecting on all the activities and debates on decolonization issues in the Committee of 24 and in the Fourth Committee, which have culminated in the adoption of the clutch of resolutions this morning, my delegation believes that the cost and effort devoted to these issues are disproportionate to the scale of the real remaining problems. We believe that the United Nations has more important goals, affecting vastly greater numbers of the world's population, which merit higher priority.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">We further believe that the activities and structure of the General Assembly should reflect the future priorities of the United Nations, and not those of the past, as well as a reasonable regard for the sensible use of resources. We shall therefore work, with others, as appropriate occasions arise, for changes that will better reflect the future priorities of our Organization, including those mentioned by the Heads of State and Government during this fiftieth session, priorities among which decolonization received hardly a mention.</p>

	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa01">Costa Rica is appearing before the General Assembly at its fiftieth session pursuant to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-9.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 48/9</a> of 25 October 1993. We are pleased to have the opportunity to report on events relating to the University for Peace, and on its achievements, during the period 1993 to 1995, as well as on its goals and efforts for world peace in the period leading up to the new millennium.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa02">We are all very much aware of the profound changes occurring on the international scene and of the course being taken by the international community to build a new international order, in which interdependence and integration are regarded as essential foundations of the United Nations system. In this climate of transition, the University for Peace is trying, through its academic work and in cooperation with peoples and Governments, to identify viable alternative ways of contributing to the promotion of the new culture of peace, which was initiated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). There is no doubt that this will have a favourable effect on the quality of life, human development and sustainable development. Its promotion responds to the most worthy and realistic imperative of modern times: "disarming the minds" of men and women at all stages of life -- from infancy to old age -- in order to achieve true peace.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa03">Within the "Education for peace" framework, projects have been initiated to reduce tension and to promote and enhance understanding, tolerance and solidarity. The University for Peace will from now on strengthen and expand the programmes that it has been promoting since its establishment, and it will develop them with new approaches in the search for solutions to new situations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa04">An important event for the University occurred during the period under review, when in April 1994 the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in consultation with the Director-General of UNESCO, Mr. Federico Mayor Zaragoza, named the new Council -- the University's highest authority -- in accordance with article 6 of the University's Charter. The Council held its ninth regular meeting on 3 October 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa05">The members of the Council are distinguished personalities who have made important contributions, in the academic, political and economic fields, to world peace. They were chosen on a strict basis of wide geographical, cultural and intellectual distribution.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa06">The new Council includes: Mr. Javier Prez de Cullar, former Secretary-General of the United Nations; Mr. Cyrus Vance, former Secretary of State of the United States; Mr. Enrique Iglesias, President of the Inter-American Development Bank; Mr. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany; Mr. Alfonso Escamez, former President of the Central Bank of Spain; Mr. Thierry de Montbrial, Director of the French Institute of International Relations; Mrs. Dharma Kumar, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Adviser in India; Mrs. Grace Alele Williams, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin, Nigeria; Mr. Francis Deng, Director of the Brookings Institute; and Mr. George Abi-Saab, Director of the Geneva Institute for Advanced International Studies. The other Council members are: Mr. Rodrigo Carazo, former President of Costa Rica; Mr. Jaime Montalvo, former Rector of the University; Mr. Nitin Desai, representing the United Nations Secretary-General; Mr. Dimitrio Chitoran, representing the Director-General of UNESCO; Mr. Marcel Boisard, Acting Director of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research; and Mr. Jacques Fomerand, representing the United Nations University.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa07">At its ninth regular meeting, the recently constituted Council appointed Mr. Javier Prez de Cullar as its new Chairman; Mr. Edwin Leon as its Vice-Chairman; and the Deputy Rector, Dr. Francisco Barahona, as the Acting Rector. At that meeting, guidelines for the University's operation were considered, new programmes to promote its work were adopted and important decisions were taken on consolidating the institution and on its future progress.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa08">In the period under review the University for Peace provided two academic training projects at the postgraduate, master's, level -- one in cooperation, development and peace and another in ecology and peace. They were attended by students of international relations from all five continents -- 46 students from 23 countries.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa09">Some specialized programmes were carried out on social-labour concertation, with emphasis on Central America. The first postgraduate specialist course in labour relations and human resources ended on 15 October 1995; developed by the Institute for Labour Relations, it was attended by 20 Central American students representing trade unions, Governments and employers -- the tripartite sector.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa10">There was also an international programme of indigenous studies in the context of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People. That programme, which enjoyed special support, was begun in January 1994 in conjunction with the Saskatchewan Federated College of Canada; 74 students from 19 countries took part.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa11">Academic work in recent years has been intense. Master's programmes and special courses have been offered in natural resources, human rights, education for peace, the peaceful resolution of disputes, labour relations, sustainable development, peacemaking processes and the culture of peace and democratization, with some 2,500 participants from 36 countries.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa12">In commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations the University carried out a programme of activities in 1995, in conjunction with the Costa Rican Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations. Among the academic events at the University were workshops on the International Day of Peace, the role of international agencies in Costa Rica and a study on tolerance and indigenous peoples. In the social sphere, a gala concert was held commemorating the fiftieth anniversary.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa13">The University's Gandhi Centre for audiovisual communications prepared documentaries and disseminated information on the United Nations system. The Gandhi Centre prepares and monitors plans for products and programmes to achieve the University's goals. In recent years the Gandhi Centre has increased and intensified its work with United Nations specialized agencies, such as UNESCO, UNDP, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Recently it was contracted by the Programme for a Culture of Peace and Democracy in Central America to prepare videos and documentaries.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa14">In the past five years information programmes have been developed for "third-age" visitors, who have been given lectures related to the academic purposes of the University. Principal responsibility for this initiative has been undertaken by the Costa Rican Foundation of Friends of the University for Peace, which has provided partial financial support to the University. Some 3,000 persons participated in this programme during the period under consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa15">I turn to the University's infrastructure. The University for Peace is situated in property covering 302 hectares -- 700 acres -- that it owns. Some 200 hectares covered with unspoilt woodland are used for scientific research and environmental education. The facilities of the University for Peace have been built on the remaining land. In 1993-1994, 16 new lecture halls able to accommodate 500 students were built, being added to the six already in existence. A dormitory unit for 20 persons has also been built, as well as a computer room with 24 terminals and plenty of room for expansion.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa16">Although I would like to speak in greater detail about the achievements of the University for Peace, I am aware that statements must be of a reasonable length. Therefore, I now turn to the draft resolution in <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.42.pdf" class="pdf">document A/50/L.42</a>, "University for Peace", which I am pleased to submit on behalf of my own country, fraternal countries of Central America -- El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama -- and the other co-sponsors: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Cambodia, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Cte d'Ivoire, Chile, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Myanmar, Paraguay, Peru, Romania, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Suriname, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Uruguay and Costa Rica, which have now been joined by Burundi and the Russian Federation.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa17">The draft resolution is similar to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-9.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 48/9</a> of 25 October 1993. However, in view of the considerable changes that have taken place on the international scene, we have included some new concepts reflecting the work of the University for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa18">We need to amend the first preambular paragraph of the English text. The Spanish text correctly reads, at the end of that paragraph, after the words "<i>promocin universal</i>",</p>
	<blockquote id="pg024-bk05-pa19">"dentro del sistema de la Universidad de las Naciones Unidas".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa20">The English text reads:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg024-bk05-pa21">"the universal promotion thereof within the United Nations system".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa22">That is incorrect; "the" should be replaced by "its" and "thereof" should be deleted. The end of the paragraph should now read:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg024-bk05-pa23">"its universal promotion within the system of the United Nations University".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa24">The second and third preambular paragraphs recall the chronology of the resolutions establishing the University for Peace in conformity with the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa25">The fourth preambular paragraph recognizes the financial limitations which have impeded the full development of the activities and programmes necessary for carrying out its important mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa26">The fifth preambular paragraph recognizes the importance of the assistance given to the University during the period 1993-1995 by Canada, Costa Rica, the Netherlands and Spain, as well as the contributions by foundations and non-governmental organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa27">The sixth preambular paragraph notes that in 1991 the Secretary-General, with the assistance of UNDP, established a Trust Fund for Peace consisting of voluntary contributions in order to provide the University with the means necessary to extend its sphere of activity to the rest of the world and to take full advantage of its potential capacity for education, research and support of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa28">The seventh preambular paragraph, which is new, notes that the University has placed special emphasis, in the context of the report of the Secretary-General entitled "An Agenda for Peace", on the areas of conflict prevention, the maintenance and consolidation of peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Although the University for Peace is wholly autonomous in its work and planning, the Government of Costa Rica has often lent its support to the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa29">In the eighth preambular paragraph, which is also new, we point out the importance of education for peace to help foster respect for all the values inherent in peace and universal coexistence among human beings, which the University for Peace has been doing and continues to do in the realm of human relations -- relations between all those who take part in its programmes, who are students of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa30">The ninth preambular paragraph, another new paragraph, is very significant; it refers to the efforts made by UNESCO for the development and promotion of a new culture of peace. We have recognized this in other forums, for education and the culture of peace are, and will continue to be, most important factors in training designed to promote peace -- true peace -- in the world.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa31">With apologies to the other sponsors for not having had the opportunity to consult them in advance, I wish now to read out a new paragraph for the draft resolution, which should appear as the tenth preambular paragraph:</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa32">"<i>Noting </i>likewise the research activities for international peace and security being carried out by the United Nations University".</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa33">This paragraph thus recognizes those important efforts of the United Nations University.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa34">By the eleventh preambular paragraph, as newly numbered, the Assembly recalls that Turkey acceded to the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace on 27 November 1995, for which we are deeply grateful. We urge other States to consider doing the same.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa35">By the twelfth preambular paragraph the General Assembly recalls that in its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-11.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/11</a> it decided to include in the agenda of its forty-eighth session and biennially thereafter an item entitled "University for Peace"; it is important to recall this.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa36">I have a number of revisions to the operative part of the draft resolution; these are not complicated, but, once again, I apologize to the other sponsors for having been unable to consult them in time, as these changes were proposed only yesterday. We agreed to them in a spirit of conciliation with a view to achieving consensus on the text.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa37">There are no changes to operative paragraph 1, which makes reference to an important matter of which I spoke some moments ago, and by which the Assembly reiterates its appreciation to the Secretary-General for the establishment of the new Council of the University for Peace, which held its ninth regular meeting on 3O October 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa38">I shall now read out a revised text of paragraph 2, reflecting changes made to gain universal support for the draft resolution:</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa39">"<i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to consider ways of strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and the University for Peace and to submit a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session".</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa40">Accordingly, paragraph 5, which would have requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation of this draft resolution, should be deleted.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa41">By paragraph 3, the Assembly invites Member States, non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental bodies as well as interested individuals and organizations to contribute directly to the Trust Fund for Peace and to the budget of the University. As members can see, this draft resolution has no financial implications for the budget of the United Nations, as these contributions would be purely voluntary.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa42">In paragraph 4 the General Assembly invites Member States to accede to the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace, thus demonstrating their support of a global institution for peace studies whose mandate is the promotion of a global culture of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa43">With the deletion of the current paragraph 5, paragraph 6 will be renumbered as paragraph 5; by this paragraph the Assembly decides to include in the agenda of its fifty-second session the item entitled "University for Peace".</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk05-pa44">On behalf of the nearly 50 other sponsors of this draft resolution, my delegation urges the General Assembly to adopt it without a vote, and indeed, if possible, by consensus. As we have had to revise the draft resolution, a new text will soon be issued; it is our understanding that the General Assembly will take action on the revised draft resolution on Friday, 8 December.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. lvarez</span> <span class="nation">Uruguay</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">My delegation welcomes this new draft resolution on the University for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa02">In the 15 years since its establishment, the University has pursued and enriched its founding ideals: the achievement of the supreme value of peace through education, with a humanistic outlook and in conformity with the principles of the United Nations. The University's activities since 1980 have been marked by a firm commitment to those principles and by high academic standards in all the areas in which it has given courses and seminars. Those standards have been achieved thanks to cooperation from the many Member States and non-governmental organizations that have contributed to these important activities.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa03">I should like to highlight the generous contribution of Costa Rica, which, as host to the University, provides the infrastructure it needs. Costa Rica, a peace-loving and profoundly pacifist country, is the ideal location for such an institution.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa04">Uruguay acceded to the founding Charter of the University and to the International Agreement on its establishment in 1985, and has been a member of the institution since that year, upon parliamentary ratification of the Agreement. Uruguay's relationship with the University has been a productive one, in both academic and institutional terms.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa05">My delegation is pleased that Turkey acceded to the International Agreement in 1995, and reiterates its invitation to other Member States to do likewise as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa06">The delegation of Uruguay also supports the request to the Secretary-General to consider ways of strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and the University for Peace, which is an institution unlike any other in the United Nations system. It has made important contributions in the areas of conflict prevention, the maintenance and consolidation of peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa07">Such an institution deserves ever increasing support from the Organization in the framework of activities for peace and of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa08">As a sponsor of <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.42.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.42</a>, my delegation hopes that the General Assembly will adopt it by consensus.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Larrain</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">It is a privilege for the Government of Chile to co-sponsor the draft resolution supporting the activities of the University for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa02">My country shares the objective of promoting an international centre for post-university education, research and the dissemination of knowledge relating to training and education for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa03">Chile appreciates the work done by the University for Peace in conflict prevention, the maintenance and consolidation of peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes. It is fundamental work not only in supporting the most characteristic work of the United Nations, but also in promoting the peace and security of the human person. Promoting a culture of peace is essential today, since on it depend respect for human rights and peaceful coexistence among peoples.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa04">World events since the end of ideological confrontation, characterized by the emergence of intra-State conflicts, emphasize the urgent need to deal with the causes of conflicts and international crises and to promote the values of peace. Because justice, development and peace form an indivisible structure, Governments, institutions and individuals must redouble their efforts in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa05">The University for Peace can make a tremendous contribution to the international community. Its academic nature makes it possible to find imaginative ways to promote peaceful coexistence among individuals and nations. Peace and security is a permanent objective, and efforts to achieve it must be stepped up in the short and long term.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa06">The University for Peace requires more human and financial resources; the cause of peace demands that it receive them.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Izquierdo</span> <span class="nation">Ecuador</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">The delegation of Ecuador would like to add its voice to the expressions of support for the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.42.pdf" class="pdf">document A/50/L.42</a>, as orally revised, entitled "University for Peace". This centre for higher education, which was established by the General Assembly in 1980, upon the initiative of Costa Rica, deserves the full support of the international community. The University's activities have been meaningful in organizing education for peace, with the emphasis on research, the promotion of human rights, protection of the environment, utilization of natural resources and the promotion of international cooperation and development.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">This academic institution must therefore be universal and must increase its educational and research capabilities, thus making it possible to stimulate United Nations activities to promote peace throughout the world, particularly in conflict prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">Ecuador, as a co-sponsor of the draft resolution, had supported the request to the Secretary-General to consider the establishment of a cooperation agreement between the United Nations and the University for Peace in order to consolidate the integration of the University within the United Nations system. This would provide an opportunity for more communication and cooperation between the relevant bodies of the United Nations on topics relating to international relations, such as research and the promotion of human rights.</p>
