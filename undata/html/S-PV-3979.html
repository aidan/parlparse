	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them a letter dated 9 February 1999 from the Chargé d'affaires <i>ad interim </i>of the Permanent Mission of the Central African Republic to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, <a href="../pdf/S-1999-132.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/132</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council, noting the letter of 9 February 1999 from the President of the Central African Republic to the President of the Council (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-132.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/132</a>), takes note with satisfaction of the commitment expressed by the President of the Central African Republic to maintain peace in the Central African Republic through dialogue and consultation. In this context, it strongly reaffirms that the complete implementation of the Bangui Agreements (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-561.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/561</a>, appendices III-VI) and of the National Reconciliation Pact (<a href="../pdf/S-1998-219.pdf" class="pdf">S/1998/219</a>) is essential to peace and national reconciliation in the Central African Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council calls upon the Government of the Central African Republic to continue to take concrete steps to implement political, economic, social and security reforms as referred to in the report of the Secretary-General of 23 February 1998 (<a href="../pdf/S-1998-148.pdf" class="pdf">S/1998/148</a>) and to fulfil the commitments expressed in the letters of 8 January 1998 (<a href="../pdf/S-1998-61.pdf" class="pdf">S/1998/61</a>, annex) and of 23 January 1999 (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-98.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/98</a>, annex) to the Secretary-General by the President of the Central African Republic. It recalls that the success, the future mandate and the ongoing presence of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic are closely linked to the fulfilment of these commitments, in particular the immediate resumption of a constructive political dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council expresses its concern about the consequences that the current political tensions have for the stability and the functioning of the institutions of the Central African Republic. It reaffirms that the Government, the political leaders and the people of the Central African Republic bear the primary responsibility for national reconciliation, the maintenance of a stable and secure environment and the reconstruction of their country. It emphasizes the importance of continuing efforts in the Central African Republic to settle outstanding contentious issues peacefully and democratically in accordance with the Bangui Agreements. It stresses the need for both the "mouvance présidentielle" and the opposition parties to cooperate closely and work actively with the aim of achieving the political consensus indispensable to stability in the Central African Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council considers that a smooth preparation of free and fair presidential elections, for which proper steps should be taken as soon as possible, requires a certain level of political consensus and the opening of a genuine dialogue between all the constituent parties of the National Assembly. It also considers that consensual preparation for the presidential elections can only reinforce the legitimacy of the next President of the Republic and also secure a sustainable civil peace. It fully supports the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in his call to the Central African political leaders and authorities to resolve the political impasse so the country can move forward, and welcomes the current efforts undertaken to this end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council will remain seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1999-7.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1999/7</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
