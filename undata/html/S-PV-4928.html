<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01"> The Secretariat briefed the Council this morning on the deplorable events of the past two days in Kosovo. The overall security situation throughout Kosovo is still highly unstable. The number of fatal casualties now stands at 31. I cannot emphasize strongly enough my deep disappointment and sadness at this resurgence of violence, which has already left many people dead and hundreds wounded.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">We cannot close our eyes to the fact that this violence is ethnically motivated, with communities attacking each other. Such violence must be strongly condemned. The deliberate targeting of houses as well as religious sites -- such as churches, cemeteries and monasteries -- is shameful and inexcusable, as are the subsequent attacks against mosques in other parts of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">We must also condemn, in the strongest possible terms, deliberate attacks on representatives of the international community -- in particular the staff of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the troops serving with KFOR. The situation in Mitrovica has become sufficiently serious to warrant the relocation of international staff from Mitrovica to a safer place in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The recent events have highlighted the fragility of the structures and relationships in Kosovo. It shows that despite the progress that has been made since 1999, we have not come far enough. Mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be. It is clear that we need to study very carefully the implications for Kosovo's future.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Our first priority must be to restore safety and security. I thank NATO for its decision to reinforce its troops in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The violence must cease. The leaders of Kosovo's communities and the representatives of its Provisional Institutions must work with the international community, with each other and with the people of Kosovo to restore calm. Allow me in particular to remind the leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community that as the largest ethnic group, they have the responsibility to protect and promote the rights of all people within Kosovo, particularly its minorities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">I trust that the Security Council will give the situation the urgent and serious attention it requires.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the Secretary-General for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Goran Svilanovic, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Svilanovic</span> <span class="nation">Serbia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">I wish to express my appreciation to you, Mr. President -- and, through you, to all other members of the Security Council -- for responding so quickly to my Government's request urgently to convene this meeting. Indeed, yesterday's extremely grave developments in Kosovo and Metohija warrant immediate and resolute action by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The violence committed against the Serbian population in Kosovo and Metohija on 17 March is jeopardizing the United Nations Mission there. All efforts by the international community aimed at a peaceful resolution of the problems of this southern Serbia province are endangered. The Serbian population has suffered a purge whose objective was its ethnic cleansing from Kosovo and Metohija. KFOR and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) have failed so far to stop that action.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">It is particularly distressing that such an outbreak of violent attacks on such a wide scale by Kosovo Albanian extremists against the Serbian community in the province has happened almost five years after the establishment of an international presence there. Many people have been killed; many more have been wounded and injured. In the process, a number of Serb patrimonial sites have been set ablaze. On behalf of the Government of Serbia and Montenegro, I would like to express our deepest condolences and sympathy to the families of all the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">The attacks on the Serbian community in Kosovo and Metohija are sending more than one signal. To the Serbs, the signal is that there is no life for them in the province and that they should leave. To KFOR and UNMIK, the signal is that they have no real authority and power in their area of operation. To the Security Council, the signal -- or rather the challenge -- is that its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> will not be implemented, especially with regard to the return of all refugees and internally displaced persons and the creation of a secure and safe environment for all communities in Kosovo and Metohija.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Another signal from the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government and Kosovo Albanian political leaders to the international community is that they cannot or do not want to go out in the streets to prevent that kind of mass violence from happening. They want authority, and a lot of authority was transferred to them. However, they ignore the responsibilities that come with authority.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">The timing of the attacks is also indicative. In the near future the Security Council was supposed to finally receive the standards implementation plan. Instead, we all received the signal that I have just mentioned: Serbs should leave; after that it will be much easier to fulfil standards. Secondly, just after the Special Representative of the Secretary-General announced the date for the upcoming province-wide elections, the Serbian community was given notice that they should not think about participating in the elections, but instead should pack and go. Thirdly, is the situation now really conducive to continuing the long-awaited dialogue that just recently started?</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">The current crisis is extremely serious and may have far-reaching negative consequences. Nobody should take it as yet another incident in a long sequence of incidents over the past five years. On the contrary, everybody involved should approach the problem responsibly.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">First and foremost, a resolution should be adopted condemning Kosovo Albanian extremism and terrorism. A political and security framework for further action by the civilian and military missions in these new and grave circumstances should be defined. International forces should be strengthened and should adopt a much more resolute stand. Extraordinary measures are needed to physically protect the Serbian population, which is already preparing to flee to central Serbia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">Authorities and security forces of Serbia and Montenegro are ready to provide any assistance and cooperation to the United Nations Mission in applying those measures. The situation in Kosovo and Metohija calls for urgent and complete security stabilization. The international presence must regain full control on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">In that regard, it is of utmost importance that urgent measures be taken to secure the international border between Serbia and Montenegro and Albania and Macedonia in the area of Kosovo and Metohija. According to our information, that border is completely unguarded now and groups of armed terrorists are coming into Kosovo and Metohija with large quantities of arms and other military equipment. That could lead to further deterioration of the security situation in the province.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">Most recent events clearly highlighted the fact that political extremism -- in terms of both demands and methods -- cannot lead to resolution of the problem. Additional efforts are required, as well as additional institutional guarantees. In that regard, decentralization is essential and could be a potential step towards stabilizing the situation of the Serbian community in Kosovo and Metohija. Serbia and Montenegro is ready to participate in the preparation and implementation of a dialogue on the most important matter of institutional guarantees and decentralization.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">Albanian extremism and terrorism in Kosovo and Metohija has to be condemned. However, that is not enough. The Security Council should define the appropriate political and security instructions and guidelines for the civilian and military missions in the province in these new and difficult circumstances, since organized violence such as occurred yesterday is undoubtedly the single most serious threat to peace and security in the entire region.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">As a matter of urgency and as a minimum, all planned reductions in the composition and resources of KFOR and UNMIK should be cancelled. Also, KFOR should re-establish protection for communities that were gradually deprived of that. Religious and cultural sites must be also protected full time.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa14">It is obvious that statements and declarations of good intentions are not sufficient if the issue of Kosovo and Metohija is to be dealt with seriously. Such statements are understood and taken by the extremists, who actually control Kosovo and Metohija, as expressions of weakness, not as a sign of resolve on the part of international community, specifically UNMIK and KFOR. Therefore, concrete and urgent action is required to immediately put an end to the present wave of violence. Otherwise, the objective of creating a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo and Metohija will very soon be irreversibly damaged.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro for his statement. I now give the floor to the Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, Mr. Joschka Fischer.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fischer</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank my colleague, Foreign Minister Svilanovic of Serbia and Montenegro, for his statement, and the Secretary-General for his comprehensive and informative briefing. I would like to associate myself with the statement to be made later by Ireland on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">We were shocked and dismayed as we learned of the events unfolding in Kosovo yesterday. We profoundly appreciate the great efforts made by the Special Representative to the Secretary-General for Kosovo, Mr. Holkeri, the staff of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), KFOR and the police to bring the situation under control in the face of the dangers confronting them. The violence has claimed many lives and caused injury to large numbers of people among the Kosovar communities as well as UNMIK, the international police and KFOR, and it must be condemned in the strongest words. Our hearts and our deeply felt sympathies are with the victims and their families. I would like to extend my condolences to them.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">The international community as well as political leaders in Kosovo, both ethnic Albanian and ethnic Serb, have great responsibilities over the next few days. The most important immediate task is to restore and maintain order. KFOR troops and the police will have our full support as they take whatever steps are necessary to stop the violence. We were deeply disturbed by reports that KFOR troops were themselves the object of attack yesterday. Germany supports the decision made to bring in additional KFOR troops.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">All leaders of Kosovo, especially those who have been elected, must show the utmost political courage in order to prevent the violence from undoing all the painstaking efforts made over the past several years toward building a tolerant and democratic Kosovo. The joint statement made yesterday by politicians together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General was a useful first step. It rightly emphasized the need to support the police and KFOR and noted the importance of responsible media behaviour. Political violence is fed by misinformation, and the press should not abet the plans of extremists by crediting unfounded rumours.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">But political leaders in Kosovo must go further. Inter-ethnic violence is absolutely unacceptable and must be condemned. We expect those leaders not only to speak out against violence but also to actively promote inter-ethnic understanding. They must also explain to their constituents that no political grievance justifies taking the law into their own hands. Political leaders should visibly support all efforts by law enforcement authorities to apprehend and punish anybody who committed crimes or abetted violence and should explain clearly why those people are enemies not only of public order but also of the legitimate democratic aspirations of the people of Kosovo. There will be no impunity for the perpetrators. Now is the time for responsible Kosovo Albanian and Kosovo Serb leaders to appear together before the people of Kosovo and to defend democratic values against anarchy and mayhem.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Political leadership in Belgrade should also exercise its responsibilities. It is especially important at this time to prevent acts of retribution in Serbia. That would only lead to an escalation of violence and feed into the hands of extremists. We urge Belgrade to do all it can to prevent further attacks on religious sites such as took place yesterday in Belgrade and Nis. We also urge Belgrade to continue the direct dialogue with Pristina that was begun this month with the working groups on energy and missing persons.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Yesterday's events highlight the stark choice facing the people of Kosovo. Either they create a society based on tolerance, multi-ethnicity and democratic values, or they live in chaos and misery. It is too early to say how the violence has set back the process of implementing democratic standards. But once calm has been restored, the only responsible course is to proceed as quickly as possible with the efforts to implement the "Standards for Kosovo" and to finalize the implementation plan. Only by focusing on achieving those standards can Kosovo put this ugly series of incidents behind it and begin again to make progress with regard to its European aspirations.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers kindly to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">I would like first to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this meeting to discuss the situation in Kosovo. This debate is of great importance, given the recent events that have taken place on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">We welcome the presence among us of the Secretary-General, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, Joschka Fisher, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro, Goran Svilanovic. Their participation is powerful testimony to the gravity of the events that we are considering today.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">My Government condemns with the utmost vigour the atrocious acts of violence -- the worst since 1999 -- that have taken place between Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs in Mitrovica, Pec and elsewhere, resulting in a tragic loss of life, injury to hundreds, including personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR, and substantial material damage. Those responsible must be brought to justice. Impunity must not be allowed to take hold in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">We would like in particular to offer our condolences to and express our solidarity with the families of those who have died.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">The acts of violence, which now seem to be out of control, cannot and should not pressure us to attempt interpretations regarding the ultimate motivation of such violence or cause us to falter in our efforts to achieve a multi-ethnic, democratic Kosovo capable of integrating all its inhabitants, without exclusion of any form, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">We are concerned about the political damage that may be done to the process by those reprehensible acts. We therefore call on all the parties involved to abandon their combative posture and use available peaceful and democratic means to resolve their differences.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">The guns must be silenced and dialogue resumed. Without constructive dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, or between UNMIK and the Kosovo Assembly, a concrete response to the enormous challenges that exist will remain a remote expectation. Worse still, the most important of all the objectives -- ensuring that all the inhabitants of Kosovo can live in their homeland in dignity, freedom and security -- would be undermined.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">Finally, we would like to reaffirm our full support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the personnel of UNMIK and the maintenance of the policy of "standards before status".</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zhang Yishan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I should like first of all to express my gratitude to you, Mr. President, for having convened this necessary and timely meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The Chinese delegation would like to welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany to today's meeting. I would also like to welcome in particular the presence of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">The Chinese delegation is shocked by the serious, bloody events that have taken place in recent days in Mitrovica and other cities in Kosovo, resulting in many deaths and injuries. We condemn those acts of violence in the strongest terms. I would like to take this opportunity to express our deep condolences to the families of the victims. We call upon the Albanian and Serb communities in Kosovo to exercise maximum restraint so as to prevent the situation from worsening.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Those tragic events have demonstrated that, almost five years after the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, the situation in Kosovo is still very fragile and there is still a long way to go before peace, stability and multi-ethnic harmony and peaceful coexistence can be achieved in Kosovo. The international community, the Government of Serbia and Montenegro and the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government must redouble their efforts to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">We welcome the joint statement made on 17 March by UNMIK, the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, political leaders and other parties. We support all the efforts made by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, UNMIK and KFOR to re-stabilize the situation. We earnestly hope that the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government and other relevant parties will work closely with them so as to prevent such events from recurring.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">The Romanian authorities are deeply concerned about what has happened in Kosovo in recent days. I believe that all the countries in our region share this serious concern. We are also in full agreement with the statement on Kosovo issued by the European Union, with which we have associated ourselves.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">We believe that the gravity of the situation is clearly evidenced by the presence at this meeting of the German Vice-Chancellor, Mr. Joschka Fischer, and of the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro, Mr. Goran Svilanovic. My delegation appreciates the personal presence at this important Security Council meeting of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">First and foremost, all violence should stop immediately. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR have our full support to use their capabilities and powers to restore calm and protect Kosovars, regardless of their ethnic identity. We welcome NATO's decision to send reinforcements to Kosovo, demonstrating the alliance's will to carry out its mission in Kosovo and its stability to do so. Any attack against KFOR troops and UNMIK personnel is unacceptable to us. The perpetrators of such attacks and of all of the violent acts that have erupted in Kosovo must be brought to justice as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Romania is profoundly saddened by the deaths and injuries that occurred during the events in Kosovo, including the casualties among KFOR troops and the UNMIK international civilian police. We extend our condolences to the families of the victims and our sympathy and support to the injured.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Romania is also outraged and disappointed by the massive display of ethnic hatred that was shown in Kosovo at a time when our hopes were going towards a committed implementation of the standards laid out by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">The deplorable and tragic events in Kosovo have demonstrated beyond doubt that the international community should remain focused and determined, and that the highest priority should be given to enforcing the rule of law, ensuring proper security for all ethnic minorities and bringing to justice the perpetrators of criminal acts. Until we have tangible progress in these issues, we cannot approach successfully other problems related to Kosovo's future.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">At the same time, we should not allow five years of tremendous efforts in Kosovo to be washed out by these events. Once normalcy is restored, there will be important lessons to be taken by all concerned. But the international community should be undeterred in its fundamental objective of establishing a stable, multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. There should be no turning back to the past and no giving back to extremists.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">The political leaders in Kosovo must exercise their democratically established authority over the population in order to unequivocally protect all minorities and their extremely important religious, cultural and historical heritage. This is a fundamental value for Europeans, and we would want to make sure in the future that it is equally appreciated and observed by Kosovo society.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">As I have mentioned before, Romania continues to be fully committed, politically and as well as in very concrete terms, to Kosovo's stabilization. As a token of this commitment, we are proud that yesterday a Romanian gendarmes detachment faced up to the pressure and fulfilled their responsibilities in helping restore the situation in Mitrovica, along with their colleagues of the multinational KFOR and UNMIK troops.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I, of course, join you, Mr. President, in welcoming the Secretary-General, the Foreign Minister of Serbia and Montenegro and the Foreign Minister of Germany, to this Council meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The events that have taken place in Kosovo threaten the security of Kosovo and the wider region. These are the most serious security incidents since the end of NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1999. They must halt and must not be repeated.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The United States fully supports the strong efforts of KFOR and of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Holkeri, to re-establish order and to calm the situation. KFOR, together with the international civilian police and the Kosovo Protection Force, are fully engaged. Those responsible for the violence, on whatever side, should be brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">My Government resolutely condemns these incidents of serious violence in Kosovo. It is tragic that a still undetermined number of people, perhaps 30 or more, both Serbs and ethnic Albanians, have been killed and many more injured. Churches and homes have been burned. The United States extends its sincere condolences to the families of all who have lost their lives in Kosovo in the last days or who been injured or have seen their property lost. We also condemn attacks on the international presence, which are completely unacceptable and which must cease.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">We call on all people in Kosovo immediately to restore calm, observe order, return to their homes, stop damaging cultural, religious and historical sites, lift the blockage of transportation arteries and support the efforts of KFOR and the international civilian police. We also urge the people and the Government of Serbia and Montenegro to continue to support our efforts to restore calm in Kosovo and to stop arson attacks on religious sites in Serbia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">There can be no way forward for the people of Kosovo other than to respond to yesterday's joint appeal of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the leaders of the Kosovo Provisional Institutions of Self-Government urging the restoration of calm and order. The rule of law is an essential condition for the future. We urge leaders of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government from all communities to continue to urge their constituents to desist from violence fully and unconditionally.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">My authorities have asked me to conclude with an appeal to the leaders of Kosovo: that they understand that the complete cessation of violence is the prerequisite for us to make decisions on Kosovo's future political status. This cannot be accomplished through violence.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gaspar Martins</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">We thank you very much, Mr. President, for convening this timely meeting on Kosovo. We welcome particularly the presence of the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and the presence of the Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, Joschka Fischer and of Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The events taking place in Kosovo are unexpectedly threatening years of hard work by dedicated peace-builders and the huge financial, human and political investment in peace by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">When, a few weeks ago, the Council considered the Secretary-General's report on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-71.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/71</a>) and we heard the statement by the head of the Mission, it was quite far away from our minds that events like those occurring now could take place. Despite difficulties and the awareness of the long way to go before a democratic and multi-ethnic society could be established in Kosovo, we were comforted by assurances that real progress had been achieved and that the benchmarks established by the international community towards that end could be met in the foreseeable future. The disturbing events occurring now in Kosovo deserve our strongest condemnation and are a wake-up call to the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">At the last meeting of the Council devoted to the situation in Kosovo (see <a href="../html/S-PV-4910.html">S/PV.4910</a>), the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro called our attention to a number of facts: the decrease in ethnically-motivated crimes, but with the authors of such crimes enjoying impunity; the discouraging number of returns of displaced persons; and the lack of political will to create conditions for the effective participation of the Kosovo Serbs in the political process. The Assistant Minister considered that UNMIK's main task should be to create sustainable conditions for a multi-ethnic Kosovo, where all communities could live freely and accede on an equal footing to the Institutions. I mention these facts since pointing them out will help us remember that something was brewing and that there was a warning to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">In the view of my delegation, this is not a time for despair, despite the gravity of the situation. The international community's commitment to Kosovo must continue. In our view, the strategy applied so far -- the "standards before status" policy -- is a just one, which, with determination and preservation, will bear results.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">The events occurring now show that the attainment of the final objective is further away than planned, but we are still confident that the people of Kosovo, with the assistance of the international community, will be able to meet the objectives set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">Before concluding, a word of condolence and sympathy to the families of the victims, as well as a word of encouragement for all those who strive for a better future for the population and for a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">I end by expressing my delegation's full support for the Special Representative, UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to stabilize the situation in Kosovo.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I would like to associate myself with the statement to be delivered later by Ambassador Ryan on behalf of the European Union, with the comments of all those who have called for an end to violence and with those who have expressed sympathy for the victims and their families. And like others, the United Kingdom welcomes very much the presence of the Secretary-General and the two Ministers at this very important debate.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Yesterday was a very bad day for Kosovo. As the inter-ethnic violence spread, so the clock was turned back. The truth is that Kosovo has too much history. There has been too much inter-ethnic bloodshed in the province. Instead, Kosovo has no choice but to move forward. In the short term, its leaders must not only condemn violence; they must use their influence actively to work with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR to restore order.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">This is the time to encourage calm, not the time for rhetoric or irresponsibility. It is the time for measured, considered action, not impetuosity. It is the time to show solidarity between the different communities, not to increase division. And it is the time for democratic credentials to be burnished, not an opportunity for anarchy and riot. Lastly, I think it is a time for a continued and strengthened dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">At the request of the Secretary-General of NATO, the United Kingdom is at this moment deploying a spearhead battalion into Kosovo. It is the Operational Reserve Force, and it will be there from tonight. It will start to deploy to help stabilize the situation on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">But looking forward, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> charts a future. It sets a clear vision for Kosovo. It gives an opportunity to Kosovo leaders. The international community has invested very substantially in that future and in that vision of a tolerant, multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo. UNMIK, Special Representative Holkeri and KFOR enjoy the full support of the British Government in trying to help achieve those goals.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">That is why the Council has endorsed the "Standards for Kosovo" paper and the review mechanism. That remains the only way forward for Kosovo. Those attempting to derail the process will not be allowed to prevail, nor will the perpetrators of violence succeed in speeding up final status negotiations -- quite the reverse. The international community is entitled to expect and require the implementation of those standards, to demand an end to violence and to insist that Kosovo, its institutions and all its people renew their commitment to the rule of law, to the tolerant coexistence of communities and to establishing a real democratic future for the province.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adechi</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting to examine the tragic situation prevailing in Kosovo. My delegation expresses its full appreciation to the Secretary-General, whose presence among us at this critical moment for the future of Kosovo demonstrates his personal commitment to the international community's rapid and concerted action in the face of the latest developments of which we have just been informed.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">I also welcome the presence at this meeting of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The tragic events, which we condemn, demonstrate that the process of reconciliation among the ethnic communities living in Kosovo still has far to go. At the very least, we can say that mutual trust between the two communities has not been fully established and that, rather, mistrust runs so deep that the slightest incident is liable to trigger an outburst of violence, with incalculable consequences for the process of building the rule of law in Kosovo. Benin vigorously condemns the acts of violence, the instances of ethnic cleansing and the attacks on the integrity of the international missions in Kosovo. As well, we extend our condolences to the families of victims.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">The damages suffered by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR are completely unacceptable, as are the loss of human lives in the two communities and the destruction of property and cultural artefacts, which constitutes a grave attack on the shared patrimony of humankind. The perpetrators of those acts are personally responsible for their actions. The international community must ensure that no crime or violation of human rights in Kosovo goes unpunished.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">We believe that in the current situation the Security Council must urgently send a strong message to the Serbian and Albanian communities of Kosovo, calling on them to show greater restraint. The multi-ethnic character of the province, tolerance and the equal rights of all communities must be respected. The acts of intimidation and inter-community violence hinder the establishment of a democratic Kosovo that respects the rule of law. We should therefore do everything to prevent another humanitarian catastrophe.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">In that regard, we support the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, who should make use of all his authority in Kosovo to prevent an escalation of violence and a humanitarian disaster in the province. We also support the reinforcement measures to restore order and calm.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">That said, in Kosovo, we should put more emphasis on measures to strengthen trust between the two communities, to promote the reconciliation of ethnic groups and to strengthen the authority of the established democratic institutions, rigorously applying the norms established by the international community before the decision on the final status of the province.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this very timely meeting. I would like to welcome the presence of the Secretary-General on this occasion, and I express  our greetings to the Foreign Ministers of Germany and of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">As the sound of gunfire and explosions is heard once again in the streets of Mitrovica and many other localities, Brazil shares the indignation and sorrow of the international community at another surge of intolerance, revenge and ethnic violence in that region of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The peacekeeping and international police forces reacted quickly to try to defuse yesterday's riots. Unfortunately, their efforts could not avoid the escalation of violence that resulted in the death of civilians and left hundreds injured. Moreover, to our deep regret, they became themselves victims of blind violence, as a number of KFOR soldiers and civilian police of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) were among the wounded. We expect that those responsible for such acts will face justice and that the announced deployment of three new peacekeeping units will strengthen the efforts of KFOR and UNMIK to prevent further clashes.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">During its five years of tireless work there, the United Nations has helped fight the scourges of crime, terror and ethnic cleansing. It is disheartening to see that, despite that strenuous endeavour, the situation threatens once again to deteriorate into rioting and chaos. This is undoubtedly the most severe case of unrest since the end in 1999 of the conflict in the region, as many of those who spoke before me have pointed out.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">Our delegation has reaffirmed on many occasions our commitment to a stable, democratic, peaceful and multi-ethnic Kosovo. We firmly support joint action to promote reconciliation and stability. We believe that the full protection of human rights is essential to achieve peace on the basis of international law. Brazil continues to support the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the "standards before status" policy as the only reasonable choice for a peaceful Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">We condemn ethnically motivated brutality. In this regard, we add our voice to that of the Secretary-General in his strong condemnation of the incidents and in his call for an immediate halt to the ethnic violence. We also fully support the work of the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Harri Holkeri.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">This alarming outbreak of violence calls for an appropriate and vigorous reaction by the international community. It reminds us that many important challenges still remain. Nevertheless, nothing can really be done without serious efforts by all parties involved, including local authorities, both in Pristina and in Belgrade.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">A truly multi-ethnic society can be built only through decisive involvement and participation by all individuals and groups, including all minorities. The ultimate responsibility for preventing Kosovo from being engulfed once again in conflict rests with their people and leaders. Their commitment to the Provisional Institutions, their peaceful engagement in the political process and their willingness to fight corruption and adopt the necessary economic reforms will determine their ability to find a way out of the present deadlock.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">We vigorously condemn the clashes that have taken place in Kosovo, which have resulted in many deaths and injuries as well as in attacks against international organizations in Kosovo. We appeal to all Kosovo communities to put an end to the acts of violence and to return to dialogue and negotiation in order to resolve their differences.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">Lastly, we reaffirm our conviction that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> is the sole legal framework for the establishment of a democratic and multi-ethnic society in Kosovo.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, we would like to thank you for convening this meeting today with regard to the grave events in Kosovo. We are grateful for the presence of the Secretary-General and for the eloquent statement he made to the Council this afternoon. I would like also to welcome warmly the participation of Foreign Minister Fischer of Germany and of Foreign Minister Svilanovic of Serbia and Montenegro at this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">Pakistan condemns the violence in Mitrovica and other parts of Kosovo in the strongest terms, especially the loss of human life, including the death of innocent children. We condemn also the attacks against the personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and of KFOR and against religious sites, and demand that such acts be stopped. Like others, we call for legal investigations to ascertain the origins of these alarming events and to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">Pakistan fully supports the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Holkeri, and the call made by the Secretary-General to help restore calm and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The disturbing events in Kosovo underscore the urgent need to uphold the rule of law, ensure proper security for all ethnic communities and bring to justice all those involved in criminal acts. We join others in urging all the people of Kosovo to work through the recognized legitimate channels, including UNMIK and the Provisional Institutions, to address their grievances. We also agree that the establishment of a multi-ethnic, tolerant, democratic and peaceful society in Kosovo remains a fundamental objective in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">The present disturbances are the worst that Kosovo has experienced since 1999. We must reflect deeply on the reasons for this. We must evaluate whether our approach so far requires any adjustment. We must note the perception, brought to our attention today, that the international community is not being seen in Kosovo as taking credible steps towards a final and durable solution.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">Our fundamental aim must be to address the root causes of the tensions and conflict in Kosovo. In that regard, I wish to conclude by offering some observations on what steps should be taken to address the challenge, which I would like to submit for the Council's consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">First, there is a need to press all parties to rein in their respective extremists and to ensure that such violence, especially against  innocent  civilians, including women and children, is no longer tolerated.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">Secondly, there is a need to intensify security efforts against those extremist elements as well as against organized crime, which feeds them, including, as far as possible, the securing of Kosovo's borders.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">Thirdly, it is necessary to seriously prepare the ground for the peaceful, legal and democratically rooted process of resolving Kosovo's final status. Without movements towards this, the solution to the problems in Kosovo may continue to remain elusive.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baja</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, we thank you for having convened this afternoon's meeting on Kosovo and the Secretary-General for his comprehensive and informative briefing. We are honoured also by the presence in our midst of the Foreign Ministers of Germany and of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Yesterday Kosovo once again became a war zone when the longstanding ethnic animus between the Serbs and the Albanians erupted in an orgy of death and destruction -- the worst since the international community stepped in five years ago to put an end to a bloody conflict which neither side seems willing to forgive and forget.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">We condemn the violence, which has resulted, as reported this morning, in 31 people dead and more than 200 wounded, including 11 peacekeepers and 61 police officers. These are only initial figures. The number of dead and wounded is expected to rise. The extent of the property damage has still not been fully assessed, although we know that a number of houses and public buildings have been torched by rampaging mobs across the country. We have been informed by our embassy in Budapest that even the Philippine police contingent's quarters in Kosovo have been burned and looted.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">My delegation joins the rest of the Security Council in expressing our indignation at these reprehensible acts of violence, which have dealt a severe blow to the international community's efforts to bring about a tolerant, multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo. Such outbreaks of ethnically related violence have no room in Kosovo's future. This violence has to stop, and it must stop now.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">What happened in Kosovo yesterday is indeed unfortunate. Only a few weeks ago, we heard the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Harri Holkeri, speak of how Kosovo was slowly but surely moving in the direction that the international community wants it to take. It is also regrettable this violence should happen only a few days after Mr. Holkeri announced the holding of elections in Kosovo in October and following the visit there, a few days ago, of the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Yesterday's violence may seem to be a spontaneous release of collective anger and frustration, but we should note that it took some time to build up and did not take place without warning. Before yesterday's violence, there had been indications that Kosovo remains the ethnic tinderbox that it has always been.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">This outbreak of violence has dealt a severe blow to efforts to bring peace and stability to Kosovo. What happened yesterday should prompt us to take a second look at the situation there and make adjustments if necessary. We should ask ourselves whether the violence could have been prevented. We should ask this not to put blame on anyone, but to allow us to come up with an appropriate response and to prevent such incidents from happening again. Right now, the most important thing is to restore order there. The international community must take the necessary steps to make sure that the rule of law prevails in Kosovo and that elements from both within and without are given no opportunity to sow further discord in the province in order to advance their agenda. Ethnic Serbs and Albanians must be prevailed upon to exercise restraint and avoid taking any action that would lead to further chaos. Appropriate measures should also be taken to ensure that those responsible for the latest wave of violence are brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">We join the call for Kosovars and their leaders to employ their best efforts to implement the "Standards for Kosovo," while keeping in mind that peace efforts cannot be implemented as a political project, even by the most well-meaning -- or the best-armed -- unless the soil is fully cultivated.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, I would like to thank you for having organized this emergency meeting, following the serious deterioration of the security situation in Kosovo. I would also like to welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro and to thank him for having come to New York to give us an update on the situation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">My country is following with serious concern the developments in Kosovo after the acts of violence provoked by the inter-ethnic clashes between Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs that have left 22 dead and several hundred wounded. We condemn these acts of violence, which, if unchecked, will stir up inter-ethnic rivalries, exacerbate the feelings of alienation between Kosovar communities, revive the confrontational mindset that led the country to the brink of chaos, and compromise everything that has been patiently and painstakingly achieved in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">As a result, my country calls on all parties to put an end to these lethal clashes and to work together for a return to calm and an improvement of the security situation. Maintaining order and a return to normalcy in Kosovo are also the responsibility of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR. They must fully shoulder that responsibility. The reinforcements dispatched to Kosovo in order to stabilize the situation and restore calm in the province are thus very encouraging. The police investigation currently being conducted to determine who was responsible for these confrontations and to bring the perpetrators to justice will help restraint to prevail and put an end to these clashes.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">This abrupt outbreak of violence is especially regrettable since it follows striking progress and a significant improvement in the political and operational conditions in Kosovo and since it comes at a time when intense efforts have been deployed to build a Kosovo which is multi-ethnic, tolerant, democratic and prosperous, in which the rule of law prevails and human rights are respected.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">However, these tragic incidents have revealed the ongoing nature of these ethnic schisms and have reinforced, at the same time, our deep conviction that there is no alternative to a multi-ethnic and tolerant society in Kosovo. Kosovars have no other choice than to live together, harmoniously and in peace with one another. Multi-ethnic integration in Kosovo obviously requires that reconciliation and understanding among the different Kosovar communities be promoted and that differences and resentments resulting from the period of confrontation be overcome. Reconciliation among all segments of Kosovar society is the key to any progress towards that end. This aspect must henceforth be one of the international community's highest priorities, and the international community will need to support fully the reconciliation process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">To conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to express our full support for the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the provisional authorities to establish stability and to allow for a return to calm in Kosovo.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gatilov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">We too welcome the participation in today's meeting of the Secretary-General and of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Germany and of Serbia and Montenegro. Their involvement shows the importance of today's discussion.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">Russia is deeply concerned as it follows the developments of the situation in Kosovo. As a result of the abrupt outbreak of inter-ethnic violence, we have seen numerous casualties in the region, the dead and wounded including staff of the international presences in Kosovo. The scope of the violence, apparently first perpetrated by the representatives of the Kosovar Albanian community against ethnic minorities and the international presences, allows us to speak of targeted actions to squeeze the non-Albanian population out of the region. According to the information reaching us, the situation in the district continues to heat up, particularly in the Kosovska and Mitrovica region. The Kosovar Albanians in that region are concentrated around the bridges over the Ibar river. They are building shelters in order to prepare for a transition into action. The Serbs are seriously concerned that the KFOR contingent deployed in that region will not be able to prevent a deterioration of the situation. The Security Council cannot remain on the sidelines.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">The major challenge now is to stop the violence, to do our utmost to stabilize the situation, to give the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR the chance to restore law and order in the region. We are convinced that unless we quickly take decisive measures to restore order, there is a credible danger of the peace process -- so painstakingly organized by the efforts of the international community -- being undermined.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">We are deeply concerned by the scope of the violence and the speed with which it has spread throughout the district. In our view, this once again demonstrates how fragile and unstable the peace was in Kosovo and how much more needs to be done to build trust among the ethnic groups populating the region. But for now, we must note that the process of building a multi-ethnic society in Kosovo in conformity with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> has not merely bogged down; it is, in fact, back to square one.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">Russia has repeatedly spoken of the need for a multilateral approach to the Kosovo settlement process, calling for the resolution of socio-economic problems and for ensuring equal security for all inhabitants of the region and full observance of their political rights and freedoms. How can we speak about implementing the plan approved by the international community, the "Standards for Kosovo", when, in reality, one of the parties is blatantly violating these standards? We deem it essential for the Security Council to vigorously demand that all parties to the conflict, first of all the Kosovar Albanian majority in the district, immediately cease all acts of violence.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">UNMIK, along with KFOR, must undertake urgent additional measures aimed at the unconditional restoration of legality and public order and at ensuring the safety of the representatives of all ethnic communities in the district.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">On that basis, the Russian delegation is prepared to support the draft presidential statement as a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side, which bears main responsibility for the ongoing inter-ethnic violence. For its part, as a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia is ready to participate actively in seeking a solution to the problem of Kosovo.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of France.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">Like previous speakers, I wish at the outset to welcome the participation in today's debate of the Secretary-General, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany. Their participation clearly attests to the gravity of the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">I associate myself with the statement that will shortly be made by the Permanent Representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union, and I shall confine myself now to a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">France condemns in the strongest terms yesterday's deadly clashes in Kosovo between the Serb and Albanian communities. Our first thoughts are for the families of the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">The violence also targeted the international presence in Kosovo, which has been working for peace, stabilization and reconstruction. Some dozen KFOR soldiers were wounded, and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) too was a target: several UNMIK buildings and vehicles were set on fire. This flareup of violence is the greatest challenge posed to the international community in Kosovo since 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">Whatever the causes, recourse to such acts of violence cannot be tolerated. Inter-ethnic violence and violence against KFOR and UNMIK are unacceptable and must end immediately. Those responsible must be arrested and brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">We urge all of Kosovo's political leaders, both Albanian and Serb, to act responsibly and to call on the population to put an immediate end to violence and to restore calm. They must set aside confrontation and work together to put an end to the violence.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">France attaches the greatest importance to the full and complete implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. Only the "Standards for Kosovo" will make it possible for Kosovo to draw closer to Europe. Here, respect for multi-ethnicity is among the key conditions, and under no circumstances must it be jeopardized by violence.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">The next speaker is the representative of Albania. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nesho</span> <span class="nation">Albania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">The Albanian Government is following with great concern the latest developments in Kosovo. We deeply regret the recent escalation in the situation there and the loss of human lives. In response to the recent deplorable events, I should like to reiterate the firm position of the Albanian Government against violence and violent acts, regardless of the motives behind them. We strongly condemn the violence as unacceptable and damaging.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Such events run against the general trend in Kosovo of progress towards a democratic and multi-ethnic society. They run against the general will of the people of Kosovo to build, and live in, a free and open society where the rule of law is not replaced by the violence of the past and by ethnic hatred.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">The Albanian Government stresses that this situation of violence threatens the process of democratization and reconciliation in Kosovo and that it must end immediately. We call upon all the citizens of Kosovo to demonstrate maturity, maintain calm and cooperate in full confidence with the legitimate local and international authorities -- the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR -- in order to restore law and order; we express our confidence that they will do so.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">UNMIK and KFOR have accomplished an admirable task in Kosovo, building democratic institutions, increasing stability and, ultimately, laying the foundations of a multi-ethnic society. The implementation of the standards set by the Security Council has shown the determination of the international community to create the future society of Kosovo. UNMIK and its activities should not be judged through the prism of the interests of those who feel frustrated and who cannot function under its guidance. Nor should it be judged through the prism of the interests of those who cultivate parallel structures that seek to challenge its authority. We are fully confident that UNMIK will continue to play a central and crucial role in Kosovo and that it will successfully fulfil its mandate there.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">The recent sad events in Kosovo should not be considered as reflecting a failure of the process or of the positive engagement there; they do not. Only those who are not interested in the progress of the standards and who are not confident with respect to the international community in Kosovo can say that.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">The Government of Albania takes this opportunity once again to reaffirm its support for the policy of the Security Council towards Kosovo and for its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We also reaffirm our full support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Harri Holkeri, UNMIK and KFOR, and we extend that support to them. We continue to strongly believe that the standards policy is the fundamental basis of a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Kosovo that will spread yet more stability and security in the western Balkans and that will be a part of the regional and European integration processes.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">What happened yesterday in Kosovo was not the result of coexistence. To the contrary, it was the result of a lack of engagement or action towards coexistence -- or even the result of efforts to undermine such coexistence. It was the product of a constant policy of keeping alive parallel administrative structures that continue to feed ethnic isolation and to drive new waves of ethnic separation, with the purpose of dividing Kosovo. These tragic events strongly evoke the imperative need to respect law and institutions. They give rise to serious concerns about the obstacles raised by parallel structures in Kosovo. The need to dismantle those structures grows increasingly urgent if we are to strengthen legitimate institutions, the rule of law and order, the continuity of democratic processes and the development of multi-ethnicity there. At the same time, we ask that more responsibility be devolved upon the Provisional Institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">In conclusion, I would stress that the implementation of the policy of the international community, in particular the Security Council's recommendations for Kosovo, will succeed if the regional political actors support the spirit of cooperation, European integration and coexistence there. It should be clear to all that the path that Kosovo should follow cannot be the product of any imposed unilateral initiative. It should lie within the framework established by the international community, at the core of which are dialogue and understanding, not intolerance and violence.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ryan</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding countries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, the candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, and the European Free Trade Association countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, declare that they align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">I would like to join other speakers in welcoming the presence of the Secretary-General, Foreign Minister Svilanovic of Serbia and Montenegro and Foreign Minister Fischer of Germany.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">The European Union calls for an immediate end to the violence which has claimed lives and caused injury to large numbers of people in Kosovo. We add our voice to those of Special Representative Harri Holkeri and Secretary-General Kofi Annan in condemning the violence which has erupted between Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs and which has resulted in many deaths as well as in injuries to a large number of civilians, KFOR soldiers and civilian police of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Our deep sympathies are with the families of the victims. We extend our condolences to them.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">The immediate priority is that calm must be restored in Kosovo. It is essential that the violence stop now and that it not be allowed to escalate. There is also no place for those who burn churches and mosques, schools and hospitals, and who destroy the religious and cultural heritage which is the common property of us all. The European Union calls on all local leaders to act responsibly at this dangerous moment and to use all their influence to bring an end to the violence and to restore calm.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">The European Union strongly supports the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Harri Holkeri, to calm the situation. I would like to underscore the European Union's strong support for Special Representative Holkeri in his task of implementing in full <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and UNMIK's policy of "standards before status". These remain the foundation of the international community's commitment to Kosovo. The path ahead for Kosovo lies in the implementation of the standards, and these violent events risk undermining the painfully achieved progress which has been made thus far.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice. There is a heavy responsibility on all to avoid actions which would undermine the work under way to ensure a stable future for a secure, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo within its place in Europe.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haraguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa01">Let me say at the outset that Japan strongly condemns the new wave of violence in Kosovo, which erupted yesterday and has already resulted in many injuries and deaths. My Government calls for an immediate end to the violence and demands that the perpetrators be brought to justice. We also strongly deplore the attacks on KFOR soldiers and on personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). It is particularly regrettable that those incidents occurred and that so many were killed or injured at a time when concerned parties from the international community -- especially the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Harri Holkeri -- have been making sincere efforts aimed at constructive peace-building. We also wish to extend our sincere condolences to the families of the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa02">The people of Kosovo have endured massive losses in precious lives and property in the past. Moreover, the international community has invested enormous resources, in terms of personnel, diplomacy and financial resources, in the hope of resolving this tragic situation. Japan considers that all parties to the conflict must keep those facts fully in mind. We strongly urge all parties concerned to make a determined effort to resolve the issue on the basis of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the "standards before status" policy, through strengthened dialogue and without further escalating this tense situation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa03">On the other hand, my Government believes that the international community must continue its efforts in the areas of the consolidation of peace and economic development -- which is a precondition for peace -- in order to ensure that this kind of violence does not break out again. In that connection, we hope that there will be a useful exchange of opinions at the ministerial conference on peace consolidation and economic development of the western Balkans, which we plan to hold in Tokyo in April. Japan also would like to underscore, as a concrete measure to prevent such incidents, the importance of enhancing security in Kosovo through initiatives such as the illicit small arms control projects of the United Nations Development Programme, which my Government has been supporting.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa04">Japan intends to maintain its commitment to achieving the stability and prosperity of the South-Eastern European region, in cooperation with the international community, in the firm belief that the stabilization of the situation in Kosovo is essential for attaining that goal.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nikolov</span> <span class="nation">The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">Permit me at the outset to join other speakers in welcoming the presence of the Secretary-General, Foreign Minister Svilanovic of Serbia and Montenegro and Foreign Minister Fischer of Germany. Allow me also to join those who have associated themselves with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">The Government of the Republic of Macedonia is following the situation in Kosovo with great concern. Yesterday's tragic developments run counter to the efforts of the international community and the people of Kosovo for further democratization and for the stabilization of the situation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">I would like to express my Government's deep regret and strong condemnation at the escalation of the violence between Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs in Mitrovica, Lipljane, Pec, Gnjilane and other places, which has already claimed lives and caused hundreds of injuries among civilians, KFOR soldiers and civilian police of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). We urge the people of Kosovo to demonstrate wisdom and to restore calm and normalcy. It is of great importance and immediate priority to stop the violence, which jeopardizes Kosovo's stability and security and undermines the efforts made and the achievements accomplished in the process of building a stable, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo. The destabilization of Kosovo could also jeopardize the situation in the region as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">My Government strongly condemns extremism, no matter where it comes from. It can only cause further escalation of the situation, which will not contribute to the normalization of the situation and could have further negative implications in the region. We fully support the efforts of UNMIK and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Harri Holkeri, as well as those of KFOR and the rest of the international community, to calm the situation immediately.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">Let me emphasize once again that the recent tragic developments in Kosovo are only minimizing the efforts of the international community to democratize the situation in Kosovo, to fully implement the policy of "standards before status" and to continue the necessary dialogue.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Khasawneh</span> <span class="nation">Jordan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa01">Allow me at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month and to express confidence that through your leadership you will guide its deliberations successfully. In the same vein allow me to extend my delegation's appreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency the Permanent Representative of China, for the skilful manner in which he presided over the Council during the previous month.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa02">I would also like to express our profound gratitude for the convening of this open meeting of the Council to deliberate upon the regrettable developments in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa03">My delegation wishes to express its grave concern over the outbreak of violence throughout Kosovo in a manner and on a scale that is being characterized as the most far-reaching since 1999. We condemn all manifestations of such violence, in particular the targeting of all places of worship. The renewed outbreak of violence compels us to reflect on the timeliness of the downsizing plans for the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa04">Furthermore, Jordan, being one of the contributors to UNMIK, expresses its concern over the injuries sustained by the United Nations Mission personnel in Kosovo and damages incurred to their equipment. UNMIK is operating in Kosovo with a mandate to preserve, sustain and assist in the restoration of peace and security to Kosovo and the process of institution-building therein.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa05">We are mindful of the fact that guaranteeing continued protection and safeguards for UNMIK and other international personnel in Kosovo is of paramount importance and should be observed and respected by all parties concerned on the ground, at all times and under all circumstances. In that context <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter, stresses that the Council is</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa06">"Determined to ensure the safety and security of international personnel and the implementation by all concerned of their responsibilities under the present resolution."</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa07">Moreover, we should like to point to the fact that the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court clearly classified all attacks directed against United Nations and humanitarian international personnel as war crimes in recognition of the gravity of such acts.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa08">My delegation wishes to call on all parties concerned in Kosovo to desist from taking any action that could further aggravate the situation and to take immediate steps aimed at bringing about an immediate end to violence and the genuine de-escalation of tension in Kosovo. Furthermore, we wish to remind all parties concerned of their responsibilities in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, including in particular the obligation to ensure the safety and security of all international personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa09">Finally, I wish to reiterate my delegation's appreciation to Mr. Harri Holkeri, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Kosovo and chief of UNMIK, and to all United Nations and international personnel for their dedication and relentless efforts in the performance of their mission in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa10">I would also like to extend my Government's most profound condolences to the families of the victims of this regrettable wave of violence.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Jordan for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro would like to make another statement. I give him the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Svilanovic</span> <span class="nation">Serbia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">Mr. President. I greatly appreciate the opportunity you are giving me to speak. I would like to brief the Council on several issues.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">First, unfortunately the violence is continuing today. Attacks by Albanians have been continuing, and that is why we hope that our joint efforts today will bring us to concrete action that will stop those attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">I would also like to clarify one thing. There is no violent conflict between Albanians and Serbs at this moment. But it is a permanent violence of the Albanians against the Serbs, who are living there in small numbers. Five per cent of the people living in Kosovo now are Serbs. They live in enclaves, in villages or in several houses grouped within larger cities. They have been attacked in an attempt to ethnically cleanse Kosovo before we go to the implementation of standards, following the policy of "standards before status". And that must be stopped. In a couple of days it may be too late.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">Also, attacks against international staff, as far as KFOR or United Nations troops or officers are concerned, are exclusively committed by Albanians. The international officers are only doing their jobs. They are trying to guard the people in villages or houses, and they have been attacked by Albanians. Furthermore, I would like to say that we stay committed to continue the dialogue that was launched in October in Vienna between Belgrade and Pristina. It might be more difficult today, but we are determined to fulfil our international commitments and obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">What we would like the Security Council to do is to try to find a mechanism that would also include our side in the joint efforts being made to implement the standards. We want to be part of the process of implementation, and we believe that the Council might be able to find a mechanism that would also include our side. We are not asking for veto power; we want to be part of a process.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">Secondly, there will be an evaluation process that will see how far and how much the standards have been fulfilled and achieved. We want to be part of that evaluation process also. At certain points we will discuss that status and would appreciate if at that time all options would remain open and not be pre-defined.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">I do not want to finish my statement without saying that we are very sorry for what happened in several cities in Serbia yesterday, particularly in Belgrade and Nis. I would also like to say that full control is in the hands of the Government, which has taken the upper hand in further protest demonstrations in order to be sure that there will be no violence.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">I would also like to mention that in spite of the fact that those mosques have been burned -- we are sorry for that and say that it might be that police action was not as accurate and decisive as it should be -- there was not a single attack against Bosniacs or Albanians or people of other ethnic background among the incidents yesterday and the day before in Belgrade or other cities. That was not happening against minorities.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">Finally, I would like to say that we remain supportive of every non-violent action, because we believe in the attitude of non-violence of the Security Council and all of us.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">The immediate task is to bring more troops in order to prevent any further violence and then to continue the political process that has already been defined.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">After consultation among members of the Security Council I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">"The Security Council strongly condemns the large-scale inter-ethnic violence in Kosovo (Serbia and Montenegro) that began yesterday and in which many people have been killed and hundreds injured. It also strongly condemns the attacks on the troops of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the personnel and sites of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Such violence is unacceptable and must stop immediately. Those responsible must be brought to justice. The perpetrators must understand that an attack on the international presence is an attack on the international community as a whole and that extremism has no role in Kosovo's future.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">"The Security Council calls on all communities in Kosovo, taking into account their respective responsibilities, to stop all acts of violence, to avoid further escalation and restore calm. The Council urges the parties to refrain from irresponsible and inflammatory statements and accusations. The Council reiterates that the population in Kosovo must employ peaceful, democratic means and work through the recognized and legitimate channels, including the United Nations and the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) structures, to address their grievances. It stresses that legal investigations, in particular into the incidents involving the shooting of a Kosovo Serb teenager in Pristina and the deaths of three Kosovo Albanian children in Mitrovica, are under way by the authorities in Kosovo, and calls for a thorough investigations of all other incidents.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">"The Security Council deplores the reported deaths and injuries among the population of Kosovo, as well as casualties among the Kosovo Police Service, UNMIK international civilian police, and KFOR troops. The Council extends its condolences to the families of all the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">"The Security Council reiterates the urgent need for the authorities in Kosovo to take effective steps to enforce the rule of law, ensure proper security for all ethnic communities and bring to justice all the perpetrators of criminal acts. The establishment of a multi-ethnic, tolerant, democratic society in a stable Kosovo remains the fundamental objective of the international community in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The Security Council will closely monitor the implementation by the parties of their obligations according to the 'Standards for Kosovo' document.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, UNMIK and KFOR, and welcomes that the international security presence is continuing to undertake additional measures, as deemed necessary, to stabilize the situation throughout Kosovo. It calls on the PISG, the authorities in Belgrade and all concerned to cooperate fully. The Council takes note of the joint statement of the Special Representative, PISG, political leaders and others of 17 March 2004."</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-5.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/5</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">There are no further speakers on my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
