	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation East Timor, <a href="../pdf/S-1999-1024.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/1024</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">The first speaker on my list is the representative of Portugal, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Monteiro</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Portugal fully associates itself with the statement that will be delivered by Finland on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The establishment of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) is the culmination of a process of self-determination for which the people of East Timor and Portugal have fought very hard and for so long. That is why we are extremely pleased that the people of East Timor have been able to express their will freely, albeit under extremely difficult circumstances, and can now start the challenging task of building their own country. In fact, the establishment of UNTAET is the best tribute the United Nations could pay to the suffering and courage of those East Timorese who have struggled and died for their cause.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Allow me here to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his important and inspirational role in moving the process of self-determination in East Timor towards its necessary conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">In establishing the Transitional Administration, due consideration must be paid to the overwhelming and unequivocal decision taken by the East Timorese to rule themselves. A successful Transitional Administration will require the closest contact and constant coordination between UNTAET and the East Timorese leadership, who, in the final analysis, will have to rule their own country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Portugal agrees entirely with the Secretary-General when he states,</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">"In all elements of the functioning of the governance and public administration elements of UNTAET, the United Nations will work on the basis of the principles of participation and capacity-building. This will involve assigning East Timorese to positions within the transitional administrative structures to be established." <i>(S/1999/1024, para. 47)</i></p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">We sincerely hope that this will allow for the development of a cadre of well-trained East Timorese capable of performing the administrative and public service functions necessary to support an independent East Timor. This is fundamental and will certainly be one of the elements that will in the future be used to judge the success of this operation and the capacity of the Organization to conduct similar exercises.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">East Timor is a Non-Self-Governing Territory whose privileges and rights accorded to it by Article 73 of the Charter have been denied. This situation has to be reversed now.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">In this context, we would like to express our support for the draft resolution to be adopted today, since it contains what we consider to be the basic requirements for a successful operation and will set down the foundations for an independent East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">For its part, Portugal will continue to work together with the Secretariat to put in place on the ground an efficient and effective mechanism of coordination that will reflect its unique legal and political responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">To this end, and as he requested, we have already expressed in writing to the Secretary-General our readiness to support, within our capabilities, each and every component of UNTAET, both in terms of human and material resources.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">Portugal has identified a number of areas to which it intends to make specific contributions, as requested by the United Nations. Since 27 September, the Portuguese Government has expressed its readiness to contribute assessment teams to restore basic services in a number of key sectors. I would like to recall that Portugal has already contributed to the various trust funds established to support operations in East Timor and to various humanitarian assistance initiatives.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">In this respect I must single out Australia's courageous leadership of the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET), and the outstanding financial contribution of Japan, without which the successful transition of East Timor would have been much more arduous.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">Our gratitude also goes out to all others who have contributed to the success of INTERFET, as well as to the Security Council, which enabled the establishment of that operation and, now, of UNTAET.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">Notwithstanding the remarkable advances the process of self-determination in East Timor has experienced over the last few months, it still faces enormous difficulties on the long road ahead. The guiding lights for the months to come remain the New York Agreement of 5 May between Indonesia and Portugal and the relevant resolutions of this body and the General Assembly. In this context, we welcome the implementation by the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly of article 6 of that Agreement by unanimously taking the necessary steps to terminate its de facto links with East Timor. We trust that the newly elected Government of Indonesia will fully assume Indonesia's responsibilities in the next stage of this process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">However, we must remain vigilant. We must ensure that not only the letter but also the spirit of the Agreement and of the resolutions is complied with in practice. To this end, it is absolutely necessary that the Security Council, first, guarantee that a rapid and effective transfer of power between INTERFET and UNTAET takes place without disruption on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">Secondly, the Council must guarantee that the territorial integrity of East Timor is fully respected.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">Thirdly, the Council must guarantee that humanitarian assistance is distributed to all those in need without delay, both in East Timor and Indonesia. This means, of course, free and unimpeded access for all the humanitarian organizations that will have to conduct those operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">Fourthly, the Council must ensure that the security and safety of refugees in West Timor and other parts of Indonesia is guaranteed in accordance with international humanitarian law, and that all refugees who wish to do so are allowed to return to East Timor as soon as possible, as established by the proposal presented by the Government of Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">Fifthly, the Council must ensure that Indonesia guarantees that the territory of West Timor is not allowed to be used by its so-called militias as a platform to destabilize East Timor. In this regard, allow me to call the Council's attention to the latest report of INTERFET, in which it is clearly stated that elements of the Indonesian security forces continue to support the militias and that the latter have made threats to INTERFET and stated their intention of controlling the western regencies. These are worrying developments, and at this moment, when the Security Council is considering a draft resolution of historic importance, we think it useful to recall Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that resolutions of the Security Council are legally binding on all Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">Establishing UNTAET is a fundamental step in the right direction. The creation of a multidisciplinary force which includes elements from virtually all main agencies of the United Nations family is, to us, the right approach. We sincerely hope that the concerted action of the international community will help turn East Timor into a beacon of democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights, tolerance and prosperity in the region. Of course, for this to be achieved it must count on the unwavering support of all Timorese, regardless of their political opinions, in their cooperation with the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa22">In this regard, we consider extremely encouraging the exemplary and responsible manner in which Mr. Xanana Gusmão and the National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT) have responded to the crisis. In fact, without the remarkable restraint displayed by the East Timorese leadership and the degree of social organization it provided to the population, the consequences of the crisis would have been graver still.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa23">I cannot end without expressing the profound appreciation of the Portuguese Government for the extraordinary work performed by the personnel of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) under the most difficult and stressful of circumstances, in particular the skilled leadership of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ian Martin. Their courage and determination at the risk of their own lives are examples to us all.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa24">I must also reiterate our sincere appreciation for the work carried out by the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Jamsheed Marker, and his Deputy, Mr. Francesc Vendrell.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa25">We look forward to helping East Timor become a land of life, not of death; of hope, not of despair; of the future, not of the past. The United Nations has a crucial part to play in this process of transformation. Our vision of East Timor is one of an independent country at peace with itself and its neighbours, and fully integrated into its region. As always, Portugal stands ready to support this common endeavour.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Indonesia, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Widodo</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">At the outset, my delegation would like to extend its sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. We have every confidence that under your wise and able guidance the issues before the Council will be brought to a successful conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">Allow me also to extend felicitations to your predecessor, Ambassador Peter van Walsum, Permanent Representative of the Netherlands, for his skilful stewardship of the Council's activities last month.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">This meeting of the Security Council has been convened in the light of the decision contained in the report of the Secretary-General to establish a United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) that will be charged with overall responsibility for the administration of the territory, including executive, legislative and judicial duties. It marks the beginning of a new chapter in the lives of the East Timorese people and, hence, a moment of great significance. This is therefore a fitting moment to reflect on the developments of the past 24 years, for it was the impact of all those events that has evolved into the present situation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Indonesia's responsibilities did not begin over the last year, or even the year before. It began more than two decades ago, when East Timor was plunged into civil war. Abandoned by its former colonial Power after more than four centuries of colonial rule, the East Timorese leaders appealed to Indonesia to accommodate the aspirations of the majority of its people. Through this act of integration with Indonesia, East Timor was finally able to seek peace and independence and set out on the challenging path to nation-building. Indonesia accepted this solemn responsibility and additional burden, even though East Timor was not part of the Dutch East Indies, out of which the Indonesian nation evolved. At this difficult and complex period of East Timorese history, Indonesia's actions reflected its sincerity and commitment to assist the East Timorese in their moment of need and to improve their quality of life along with that of the rest of the citizens of Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Parallel to those untiring endeavors of development, Indonesia had since 1983 been earnestly engaged in a tripartite dialogue with Portugal, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, to find a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor. Indonesia, on its part, held steadfast to the position that the venue of the tripartite dialogue, despite the obstacles and challenges strewn along the way, was the only forum in which to resolve this issue. The signing of the 5 May 1999 Agreements on East Timor, a direct outcome of Indonesia's bold initiative, was not only a significant event in the conclusion of a 16-year journey but also a reflection of Indonesia's sincere efforts to reach a solution within the framework of the tripartite dialogue. These Agreements offered the East Timorese people the opportunity to decide their political future, at a time when fundamental changes were simultaneously unfolding in the rest of Indonesia. They gave the East Timorese the option to choose wide-ranging autonomy and special status within the Republic of Indonesia, or, in the alternative, a peaceful and honorable parting of the ways. On 30 August 1999, through a direct and democratic popular consultation organized and supervised by the United Nations in accordance with the 5 May 1999 Agreements, the people of East Timor made their choice: to reject the autonomy proposal.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">In this difficult process, lest we forget, it was the Indonesian Government that extended full cooperation to the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), including support at every level, to facilitate the holding of the popular consultation. It provided security personnel so that the popular consultation could be held in a peaceful and secure environment, facilitating a large voter turnout -- astonishing even the United Nations -- of more than 90 per cent of the registered voters. It even established a task force at the ministerial level and a task force for the holding of the popular consultation to coordinate assistance in all spheres to assist UNAMET with its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Lest we also forget, when a number of violent incidents erupted following the popular consultation, marring this historic process, the Indonesian Government immediately declared a state of military emergency, thereby establishing a legal framework to enable the armed forces to take the necessary measures to restore law and order. That decision led to an improvement of security conditions in the province. Let us not forget either that, imbued by a desire to do more, it was the Indonesian Government, following a reappraisal of the situation on the ground, that invited the assistance of the multinational force -- the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET) -- to restore peace and security in East Timor, to protect the people and to implement the direct result of the popular consultation. By taking this decision, the Indonesian Government once again demonstrated its firm determination to bring order and conditions of normalcy to East Timor. Indonesia continues to render its cooperation for the effective discharge of the mandate entrusted to INTERFET.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Let us recall also that the acts of arson which claimed countless Government buildings and other infrastructures, as well as the homes of both pro-integration and pro-independence supporters, profoundly affected Indonesia. For it was Indonesia that bore the financial burden of lifting the East Timorese out of an extremely backward way of life. For instance, an 80 per cent illiteracy rate, primitive agriculture, the lack of roads and housing in isolated areas -- all of them the legacy of its colonial past -- were some of the obstacles that had to be overcome. Over the past two decades, the Indonesian Government allocated four times more resources to these efforts than to the other Indonesian provinces.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">It was also the Indonesian Government that first launched swift, massive and all-out humanitarian operations to help alleviate the plight of displaced persons. Since then, it has taken adequate measures to facilitate the operations of international humanitarian organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">As to reconciliation among the East Timorese people, Indonesia has supported every effort towards this end. From the convening of the two meetings of the All-Inclusive Intra-East Timorese Dialogue held at Burg Schlaining, Austria, to the Commission of Peace and Stability and the various forums of reconciliation held before the popular consultation, Indonesia has consistently initiated efforts and extended its moral and financial support. We have steadfastly maintained that two factions existed in East Timor whose divergent views have deep roots in East Timorese history. Given these complex factors, certain quarters have attempted to hold Indonesia responsible for certain incidents of violence that have taken place recently.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">The Indonesian Government is deeply concerned at the unverified and often exaggerated reports of human rights violations following the popular consultation. In this regard, the Indonesian National Commission for Human Rights has established an independent Fact-Finding Commission to investigate post-ballot human rights violations in East Timor. It has been mandated to carry out its task in a transparent manner, and its work will be open to international participation. This Fact-Finding Commission will spare no effort in investigating and clarifying the numerous reports of allegations, suspicions and rumors surrounding those incidents. Furthermore, the so-called incidents of human rights violations need to be viewed in relation to the prevailing realities. Allegations of mass killings have not been supported by even a shred of credible evidence, as reported by the media, officials of the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the church and other sources of information. All quarters should therefore refrain from casting aspersions on Indonesia until information has been verified and the results of impartial investigations have been made public. Likewise, self-righteous attitudes have proved, as in the past, to be of no relevance in rectifying the situation, but rather could exacerbate the problem.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">In response to the reference made by the representative of Portugal concerning the INTERFET report, my delegation rejects the allegation that the Indonesian armed forces are behind the recent activities occurring in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">Through all the aforementioned challenges, Indonesia has never wavered in its commitment to the East Timorese people. It will continue to abide by its responsibility to see to it that their choice is fully respected. We will honor the outcome of the popular consultation and ensure that the separation from Indonesia is carried out in an orderly and dignified way.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">In accordance with assurances by Indonesia, the decision of the popular consultation was placed before the newly elected People's Consultative Assembly. On 19 October 1999, the 1978 decree that integrated East Timor with Indonesia was formally rescinded, thus closing a chapter of history during which East Timor was Indonesia's twenty-seventh province.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa15">The draft resolution before us is a step towards a new beginning for the East Timorese people. One of the most important tasks for UNTAET is to promote reconciliation among the East Timorese, if East Timor is to become a viable independent nation. Given that there are two factions, it is essential for UNTAET to carry out its duties with impartiality and, especially, to ensure that all sides, irrespective of their political affiliations, have a place in East Timorese society. We sincerely hope that once UNTAET is established it will learn and benefit from the experience and knowledge gained by INTERFET and UNAMET.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa16">Finally, the Indonesian delegation would like to express its sincere appreciation and profound gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, his Personal Representative on the question of East Timor, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker, and various Member States for their manifold contributions to resolving this issue. Our task was greatly facilitated by their dedicated efforts.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Indonesia for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Australia. I invite her to take a seat at the Council table and to make her statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Wensley</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">It is with considerable pleasure that I address the Security Council on the occasion of the adoption of the draft resolution authorizing the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This draft resolution is a crucial and historic step towards realizing the desire of the East Timorese people for independence, as reflected in the outcome of the ballot of 30 August organized by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">As the transitional authority for East Timor, UNTAET is charged with the heavy responsibility of overseeing East Timor's transition to a new, independent State. In implementing this mandate, the transitional administration faces challenges that are quite simply enormous. They go well beyond the immediate and critical tasks of reconstructing East Timor's physical infrastructure and of addressing the urgent humanitarian needs of hundreds of thousands of displaced people across East Timor. UNTAET, in close consultation with the East Timorese, must also build the foundations for a democratic and stable State. It must build a constitution, a legal system and judiciary, a police force and a civil service.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">The Secretary-General's comprehensive report outlines the magnitude of this task. We have no doubt that, drawing on its experience of nation-building elsewhere in the world, the United Nations will achieve these goals and create the economic and social foundations for a well-managed, stable and democratic State. Australia is fully committed to assist in this task.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">UNTAET's mandate will culminate in a democratic election in which the people of East Timor will choose their first Government and then take their place formally in the community of nations. Australia looks forward to that day.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Australia shared the international community's distress at the post-ballot violence in East Timor. At the request of the Secretary-General, Australia accepted the leadership of the multinational force tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting UNAMET and facilitating the vital work of humanitarian agencies. Fifteen countries have now joined Australia in contributing forces in East Timor. We wish to acknowledge gratefully the ready cooperation Australia has received from regional countries and from other members of the international community in mounting the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET) operation, and enabling its early success. As the Council is aware from the INTERFET Commander's periodic reports, security has been restored to most of East Timor, humanitarian agencies are now able to conduct their work and the East Timorese people have begun to return to the homes from which they were driven.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">Consistent with the terms of today's draft resolution, Australia looks forward to the time when the multinational force in East Timor hands over its duties to the military component of UNTAET. Australia is fully committed to continuing its active role following the handover to the UNTAET force. But we also see the maintenance of peace and security in East Timor as an ongoing responsibility of the international community. Australia urges the Member States of the United Nations to take early decisions to contribute to the UNTAET peacekeeping force or to lend their support in ways best suited to their individual circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">Australia commends the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly, which on 20 October agreed by consensus to revoke its 1978 decision incorporating East Timor into Indonesia. That decision attests to the emerging democratic spirit in Indonesia, reflected also in the 7 June general elections. Australia understands that this was a difficult decision, but the historic result upheld Indonesia's responsibilities under the 5 May tripartite Agreement. The decision in one sense marked the end of a painful national and international issue, and Australia sincerely hopes that it marks the beginning of a new and positive relationship between the peoples of Indonesia and East Timor, and also of reconciliation among the people of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">It would be remiss of me not to note that the decision on East Timor was very closely followed by the election of Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati Soekarnoputri as President and Vice-President of the Republic of Indonesia. We welcome their election, which is part of the ongoing movement of political reform in Indonesia, and constitutes an important contribution not only to their country but to regional stability.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">Australia, as a near neighbour of East Timor and a responsible member of its region and the wider international community, is committed to assisting UNTAET and the East Timorese people to prepare for independence and rebuild and develop their country. We consider this to be a long-term regional and international responsibility. We urge the international community to give early, generous support to the UNTAET Trust Fund. We pledge our cooperation to the United Nations specialized agencies, international financial donors, bilateral donors and the non-governmental organization community in the period before the birth of an independent nation, and indeed well beyond.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">We congratulate all participants here today on the cooperative approach that has characterized the development and the conclusion of the draft resolution. We also congratulate the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative, Jamsheed Marker, and those who have so valiantly, strenuously and with dedication represented the United Nations on the ground in East Timor during this period. This draft resolution marks a historic day for the people of East Timor and for the United Nations efforts to build international peace and stability.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Powles</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">New Zealand welcomes the draft resolution by which the Council would establish a United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This marks a significant step forward on East Timor's road to independence, the option that the overwhelming majority of East Timorese voters chose in the popular consultation conducted by the United Nations on 30 August.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">New Zealand is committed to assisting the United Nations in this important task. A sizeable part of that commitment is the substantial contribution of New Zealand Defence Force personnel to the multinational Force -- the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET) -- which was mandated by the Security Council under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1264(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1264 (1999)</a>. As we have informed the Secretary-General, this contribution will be made available to the military component of the United Nations Transitional Administration to be authorized today. The New Zealand Government is of the view that the replacement of the multinational force by a United Nations peacekeeping force within the United Nations Transitional Administration should proceed without delay once the draft resolution has been adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">The reasons, symbolic and practical, for the replacement of the multinational force by the United Nations force as soon as possible, as was originally envisaged when <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1264(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1264 (1999)</a> was adopted and which is now provided for by the draft resolution establishing UNTAET, are compelling. New Zealand considers in particular that the establishment of the United Nations peacekeeping force will enhance the security of the operation and allow for the burden-sharing that should rightly lie at the heart of United Nations collective security measures.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Satoh</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">The draft resolution before the Security Council, which would establish a United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), is a historic step towards the independence of East Timor. I would like to congratulate the East Timorese people on the progress they have thus far made in reaching their goal and to assure them that the Government and the people of Japan will extend their utmost support and cooperation to them as they work towards final independence and nation-building.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">I would also like to applaud all those concerned, especially the Governments of Indonesia and of Portugal and the Secretary-General, for their efforts to realize this historic achievement. The decision of the Indonesian Government to hold a popular consultation in East Timor and the decision of the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly to declare void the 1978 decree that integrated East Timor into Indonesia are particularly significant and highly commendable. The successful completion of the democratic presidential election in Indonesia is encouraging in this context too: it is a testimony to the continued progress of democratization in Indonesia and is in itself reassuring for the future of East Timor, which needs to develop friendly and cooperative relations with neighbouring countries, Indonesia in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">With the adoption of this draft resolution, the process of nation-building in East Timor will commence. The process will include the filling of the vacuum in the civil administration of East Timor as well as the longer-term goal of capacity-building and development. The process will by no means be easy. It is therefore important for the outside world to provide as much support and cooperation as possible to UNTAET and to the people of East Timor and their future government. Japan, for its part, is determined to do its best to help them in their efforts at nation-building.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">It is essential for the success of nation-building that the people of East Timor overcome their present differences and achieve national reconciliation so that they can work together in unity. We also believe it vitally important for the people and the future government of East Timor to build friendly and cooperative relations with their Asian and South Pacific neighbours. Such efforts at reconciliation and cooperation, both among the people of East Timor and in their relations with the outside world, are, I am sure, what the leaders and the people of East Timor already intend to do. What the outside world must do is to encourage such efforts on the part of the East Timorese and respond to their efforts positively and productively.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">UNTAET is going to face a daunting task, and it is the responsibility of the entire membership of the United Nations to make UNTAET succeed. First, we have to make UNTAET succeed in establishing law and order in East Timor. The elimination of concerns about people's safety is a precondition for nation-building. In this context, we commend the multinational Force for its thus far successful efforts to restore and maintain peace in the territory, and we pay tribute to those countries that are contributing troops to the Force.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">Japan has pledged a contribution of around $100 million to the trust fund requested in the draft resolution, with a view to facilitating the participation of Asian and other developing countries in the force. As we all know, it is important for the force to have a truly multinational character, particularly with the participation of Asian countries, in order to ensure its smooth operation, and we strongly hope that the multinational character of the force will be maintained with the eventual transfer of responsibilities from the multinational Force to the international force of UNTAET.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">Needless to say, it is the responsibility of the Indonesian Government to stop any sabotage activities launched from its territory. And, given that the anti-independence militias' activities have yet to cease in East Timor, stronger efforts by the Indonesian Government to prevent any interference with East Timor are required.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">Secondly, we must make UNTAET succeed in improving humanitarian conditions in East Timor. Equally important is ensuring the early return of displaced Timorese who wish to return to East Timor. This task requires the efforts not only of UNTAET but also of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian agencies as well as of non-governmental organizations. The role of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in coordinating activities of various agencies is therefore particularly important in this field. Here again, the cooperation of the Indonesian Government is indispensable for the improvement of the humanitarian conditions of displaced East Timorese in West Timor and for their early return to East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">Japan, for its part, will consider additional humanitarian assistance in response to the anticipated appeal by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on top of the financial support of $2 million it provided to UNHCR and to the World Food Programme in the initial stage of their engagement.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">Thirdly, we have to make UNTAET succeed in creating a civil administration for East Timor and in building the new nation's capacity for economic and social development. It is also important that this be done with the involvement and participation of the East Timorese people.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">The responsibility of UNTAET is particularly great, not only because it will have to start from scratch but also because its will require comprehensive and long-term planning. Cooperation from the international community and from the relevant international financial institutions is critically important in this context.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa12">Japan's commitment to help UNTAET and the future East Timorese government in their efforts at nation-building has already been stated by then Foreign Minister Masahiko Koumura in his statement in the General Assembly on 21 September, and I would like to reaffirm it here today.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa13">Japan looks forward to the day when we will welcome an independent East Timor as a new member of the Asia-Pacific community and as a fellow Member of the United Nations. It is also our sincere hope that the independence of East Timor will become a success story of United Nations engagement. With this in mind, we will do our best to support UNTAET and the people of East Timor.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia -- and the associated countries Cyprus and Malta, as well as the European Free Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area, Iceland and Liechtenstein, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">The European Union welcomes the decision of the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly on 19 October to declare as void the 1978 decree incorporating East Timor into Indonesia. This decision is an important step in the United Nations-led process to pursue arrangements for a peaceful and orderly transfer of authority in East Timor to the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The European Union, together with the international community, looks forward to a smooth and peaceful transition of East Timor to full independence and trusts that the Government of Indonesia will fully cooperate to this aim. In this regard, the European Union welcomes the decision by the Security Council to establish the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">We would also like to commend the successful deployment of the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET), and praise the contributions of those United Nations Member States who have given troops and material support to INTERFET. The participation of, and lead taken by, regional States was particularly important. The European Union wishes to pay tribute to those countries in the region who have contributed to the establishment of the operation. It clearly shows their interest in the maintenance of peace in the region. In this context, we recognize the importance of the continuing cooperation of the Indonesian Government with the international force. Furthermore, we would like to emphasize the importance of a carefully managed transition period from INTERFET to the United Nations peacekeeping force in order to ensure continuity during this period.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">The European Union remains concerned at the humanitarian situation in East and West Timor. We call upon Indonesia to cease all support to the militias in West Timor and to curb their activities, to demobilize them and to secure the border effectively. Furthermore, the European Union underlines the importance of cooperation by the Indonesian authorities with the international humanitarian agencies, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to ascertain the wishes of those East Timorese in West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia, with a view to facilitating the earliest return of those who so wish.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">The European Union welcomed the resolution on East Timor adopted by the Commission on Human Rights at the special session and the subsequent decision by the United Nations Secretary-General to charge the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, with the establishment of a commission of enquiry to investigate alleged violations of international humanitarian law in East Timor. We hope that Indonesia will cooperate fully with the commission of enquiry. Finally, we would like to commend the work of the Secretary-General in pursuing the consultation process towards the independence of East Timor, and we would like to reiterate our high appreciation for the dedication and courage of UNAMET in the implementation of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">The European Union will continue to follow the situation closely and to support the work of the United Nations and the Secretary-General. The European Union will take its part in further assisting East Timor in its rehabilitation and transition to independence.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lee See-young</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">Only five months ago, in May, the long-awaited historic drama started to unfold in East Timor when the critical mass had finally been reached with the signing of the May 5 Agreement and the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1236(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1236 (1999)</a>. However, at that time no one was quite sure about the prospect for the three-phased process that the international community and the parties directly concerned had just agreed to embark on together.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">The adoption today of this Security Council resolution is of great significance because it demonstrates that, despite all the initial uncertainties and ensuing months of untold difficulties and unforeseen tragedies and sacrifices, we have been able to come through phases I and II in just half a year. We are now headed for phase III with a certain degree of confidence. As we stand at this important juncture, my delegation wishes to pay tribute to all those who have endeavoured tirelessly to make this happen.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">First and foremost, we pay tribute to the Indonesian people and the Government of Indonesia for their courageous and monumental decision to allow the popular consultation among the East Timorese and for their recent endorsement of the outcome of this consultation in favour of independence for East Timor. Secondly, we pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his bold and timely initiatives and crucial role and to his Personal Representative, Ambassador Marker, for his untiring efforts and invaluable contributions. Thirdly, we pay tribute to the personnel of United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian workers for their dedication, courage and hard work under dire circumstances. Finally, we pay tribute to the multinational force now in operation in East Timor under the leadership of Australia for its important accomplishments so far in restoring law and order, thus laying the groundwork for phase III.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The Security Council's authorization today to establish the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) is indeed a huge step forward taken by the international community to embark on the daunting task of helping the East Timorese to build an independent nation from scratch: establishing law and order, facilitating the safe return of refugees and displaced persons and the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance, rehabilitating the economy, building social infrastructure and political systems and, finally, achieving reconciliation among the East Timorese themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">My delegation fully supports the draft resolution to be adopted this morning, and wishes to reaffirm the commitment of the Republic of Korea to join the international community's effort to implement it in the months to come. It is in this context that my Government has already pledged to make its troop contribution readily available to the United Nations peacekeeping operation as soon as the transition has taken place.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">We are also of the view that the replacement of the multinational force by the military component of UNTAET should take place as soon as practicable, in accordance with paragraph 9 of the draft resolution. Furthermore, it is imperative that UNTAET start its operation with its own military component at its full disposal, given the primary importance of establishing law and order throughout the territory of East Timor. Having already made a modest contribution to the trust fund and to the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) during phases I and II, my Government is prepared to consider making a further contribution to UNTAET operations within its capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">Looking ahead, we very much hope that UNTAET will be able to fulfil its mandate as early as possible, even before the time-frame envisaged in paragraph 17 of the draft resolution, in full cooperation with Indonesia, Portugal and other contributing States, and, most important, with the full support and participation of the East Timorese people and their leadership. We believe that an early transition to full independence would be desirable not only for the East Timorese people themselves, but also from the wider perspective of ensuring peace and stability in the region as a whole and helping the Indonesians to move forward, in particular towards achieving a strong, democratic and prosperous nation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">Before concluding, I would like to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for having given non-members of the Security Council the opportunity to take part in the Council's proceedings. The Council is about to take very important decisions for the future of East Timor, decisions with considerable short-term and medium- to long-term implications, financial and otherwise -- not only for Council members, but also for non-members of the Council that are already heavily engaged in the related United Nations activities, as well as for potential contributors. Consequently, as a matter of principle and in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter, we believe that in making such important decisions the Security Council should encourage wider participation by concerned Member States in the debate and in the decision-making process, with a view to enlisting from the general United Nations membership broader support and cooperation, which are indispensable for the success of any operation envisaged by such decisions.</p>

	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Norway would like to commend the sustained efforts of the Secretary-General to find a comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor and to pursue the consultation process aimed at achieving the independence of East Timor. We would also like to reiterate our high appreciation for the dedication and courage of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) in the implementation of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">We welcome the 19 October decision of the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly to declare as void earlier decrees incorporating East Timor in Indonesia. This decision is a significant step in the orderly transfer of authority in East Timor to the United Nations -- as a transitional step on the way to full independence for East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">We remain concerned about the grave humanitarian situation in both East and West Timor. Norway calls on the Indonesian authorities to cooperate fully with international humanitarian agencies to provide support for East Timorese refugees in West Timor and to facilitate the return to East Timor of those East Timorese in West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia wishing to return.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">Norway welcomes the decision to be taken today by the Security Council to establish the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). We are committed to participating in the financing of UNTAET. Norway's commitment to support the people of East Timor will continue beyond the immediate humanitarian needs; we will also allocate development assistance funds for reconstruction and longer-term development needs.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I would first like to associate myself with the statement made earlier in this debate by the Permanent Representative of Finland on behalf of the European Union. I can, as a result, be extremely brief.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">The draft resolution on which we are about to vote today, and which the United Kingdom had the honour to pilot through the negotiations in the Council, marks the dawn of a new era for both the United Nations and East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">There is a pressing need not only to rebuild East Timor after the destruction it has suffered, but also to establish and build up an administrative framework for the transition to independence. By creating an administration and a judicial system, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) can lay the groundwork for the independent East Timor for which its people voted so overwhelmingly.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Achieving this difficult objective will be both a major challenge and a severe test for the United Nations. First of all, it is important that UNTAET be deployed as quickly as possible. But the job must also be done right. That means that the resources of the entire United Nations system -- including the funds, programmes and international financial institutions -- must be mobilized, and the East Timorese people must be fully involved in every step of the process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Finally, I should not let pass this opportunity to congratulate both the United Nations Mission in East Timor and the International Force, East Timor on difficult jobs extraordinarily well done in extremely difficult circumstances. Their performance will be the key to a smooth transition to UNTAET, which should take place as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Türk</span> <span class="nation">Slovenia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk03-pa01">Let me I assure you, Mr. President, that I will be relatively brief.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk03-pa02">None among the many observers of the Security Council will fail to notice the historic character of the action the Council is about to take today. With the adoption of the draft resolution the United Nations will assume responsibilities for security and administration in East Timor and for other issues related to the transition towards self-government and East Timor's independence. This is an important event for the people of East Timor, as well as for the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk03-pa03">Today we have to recall that back in 1975 and 1976, about a quarter of a century ago, the Security Council and the General Assembly laid down the political and legal framework that enabled an eventual genuine and honest fulfilment of the right of the East Timorese to self-determination. The way from <a href="../pdf/S-RES-384(1975).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 384 (1975)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-389(1976).pdf" class="pdf">389 (1976)</a> to the present was long and arduous, and it sometimes seemed that short-term considerations of <i>realpolitik </i>had prevailed. However, the lesson relearned in the case of East Timor is precisely the opposite, and it is very clear: a people committed to the legitimate cause of self-determination can succeed.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk03-pa04">The United Nations will now assume a huge responsibility. Rarely in the practice of the United Nations has so much had to be done by the Organization directly. It is essential that all United Nations Member States understand that their individual and collective contribution to this effort will be of decisive importance for the success of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and, indeed, for the credibility of the Organization as a whole. As in several instances in the past, success will to a large extent be dependent on the resources committed to the task.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk03-pa05">Some priorities will require immediate attention. The humanitarian situation continues to be very serious and the return of refugees needs to be accelerated. The safety and dignity of returning refugees must be ensured. The Government of Indonesia has the essential responsibility for the conditions of return of those refugees who are still in its territory. Subsequently, it will be very important that the United Nations Administration be sufficiently sensitive to the needs of the people of East Timor. We are pleased that the draft resolution to be adopted today underlines the importance of including in UNTAET personnel with appropriate training in international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law, including child-and gender-related provisions, negotiation and communication skills, cultural awareness and civilian-military coordination.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk03-pa06">Last but not least, the atrocities against the civilian population need to be fully investigated. The Security Council should be informed in due time about the progress of investigations. Truth is always the way towards reconciliation and justice is its guarantee. We hope that activities in the coming months will enable the United Nations to close a chapter of East Timorese history in dignity and to open a new one in a spirit of confidence, trust and realistic hope for a decent future.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Today, we are at a historic juncture. The Security Council is about to authorize the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), fully demonstrating United Nations commitment to the people of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">China, Indonesia and East Timor are all in the same region. We sincerely hope that the people of East Timor, with United Nations assistance, will be able as soon as possible to restore stability, develop their economy and establish amicable and good-neighbourly relations with their neighbours.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">China fully supports UNTAET in its work and will be sending personnel to participate in it. I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General's Personal Representative, Mr. Marker, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Martin, and the United Nations Mission in East Timor for the enormous amount of work they have already accomplished in very difficult circumstances. We will also fully support the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Vieira de Mello, in his work and we trust that he will prove worthy of all our hopes.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">I also wish to note that East Timor will ultimately have to be governed by the East Timorese people themselves. The United Nations presence in East Timor is to assist that island's people to achieve independence and self-reliance. Thus, the principle of the East Timorese people's involvement as principal actor must be upheld and its wishes and choices respected. To the greatest extent feasible, locals should be fully involved and play their due role.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">The Chinese delegation participated in the consultations on the draft resolution in a constructive spirit. We wish to thank the sponsors for accepting our amendments. We will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hasmy</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">My delegation believes that it is now timely for the Council to adopt the draft resolution that is before it. The people of East Timor have clearly expressed their wish to begin a new chapter in their history and this has been accepted in good faith by Indonesia, as expressed by the recent decision of the People's Consultative Assembly of that country, which is welcomed by the international community. With the adoption of this draft resolution today, the United Nations will begin the process of assuming responsibility for the transitional administration of East Timor, which will prepare the people there for independence within a few years' time.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">We believe that the successful implementation of this draft resolution will require the assistance of States Members of the Organization and the full cooperation of the parties concerned, including Indonesia, whose cooperation in the process thus far has been given recognition and appreciation. The fact that the whole exercise was completed in a relatively short time from the signing of the 5 May Agreement, in spite of the many domestic constraints faced by Indonesia, is testimony to the commitment of the Indonesian leadership under former President Habibie, to whom a special tribute is due, as well as that of the current Government under President Abdurrahman Wahid and the Parliament of Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">The role of Indonesia, along with that of Portugal, is duly recognized in the draft resolution as an important element in the successful implementation of the draft resolution and the smooth functioning of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). In reshaping the future of East Timor, due recognition should be given to the unique role that these two countries played in the context of history and, in the case of Indonesia, also in the geopolitical context. As neither history nor geography can be denied, it is important that a future East Timor Government come to terms with these realities and begin the process of forging constructive and mutually beneficial relationships with them, especially with its important neighbour. We believe that this relationship is also the wish and desire of both countries, particularly Indonesia, which is physically inseparable from East Timor, with which it shares both land and sea boundaries. UNTAET can assist in laying the groundwork for such cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">As a regional neighbour, Malaysia looks forward to a future independent East Timor's playing a full and constructive role in regional affairs and to its integration with the region. Geography dictates that East Timor is part of either South-East Asia or the South Pacific, or of both. It is, of course, entirely up to the future Government of East Timor to determine its foreign policies predicated on what would best serve its interests. Being in close proximity to both subregions, it may well be impossible for East Timor to isolate itself from either of them, but necessary for it to be close to both.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">The rebuilding and reconstruction of East Timor will require the necessary conditions of peace and stability. To this end, my delegation has stressed the importance of reconciliation among the East Timorese people as a prerequisite and therefore welcomes the inclusion of this essential element in the draft resolution. We believe that all East Timorese, of whatever political background and persuasion, have a place in a future independent East Timor. We would therefore urge UNTAET to pave the way, in close consultation with the East Timorese leadership, for a process of early reconciliation among them. We are encouraged by the initial reconciliatory remarks by Mr. Xanana Gusmão in this regard, reflecting his own statesmanlike predisposition on this matter, which, if pursued as a matter of policy by the East Timorese leadership, would augur well for the future of East Timor. The East Timorese leaders would do well to learn from the lessons of others who have been torn by internal conflict but have rebuilt their countries on the foundations of national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">My delegation supports the earliest possible phasing in of the military component of UNTAET with the introduction of a properly constituted United Nations peacekeeping force and the phasing out of the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET), consistent with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1264(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1264 (1999)</a> and the provisions of the 5 May Agreement. Malaysia supports the Secretary-General's proposal to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force of up to 8,950 troops and up to 200 military observers as appropriate and adequate.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">Malaysia has expressed the strong wish to contribute substantially to such a force as a demonstration of its continuing strong support for United Nations peacekeeping, in which it has participated actively over the years and garnered the plaudits of the United Nations for the high professionalism of its soldiers and police. It is also a reflection of Malaysia's strong desire to assist East Timor, a regional neighbour, as it finds its feet as a new player in the community of nations, towards which process Malaysia and other regional neighbours are eager to contribute. We therefore deeply regret the doubts that have been raised in some quarters as to the appropriateness and reliability of Malaysian troops' performing a major peacekeeping role in East Timor. Our record speaks for itself.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">Notwithstanding a few remaining reservations we have on the draft resolution, my delegation will vote in favour of it. We trust that its unanimous adoption by the Council will facilitate its smooth and successful implementation.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Buallay</span> <span class="nation">Bahrain</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">The draft resolution on which we are going to vote today is of particular importance because it is related to the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), which will assume, <i>inter alia</i>, full responsibility for East Timor and will be granted all the legislative and executive powers necessary to carry out East Timor's to independence. On this occasion, we wish to express our appreciation for the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in this connection.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">We believe that one of the very important tasks of UNTAET will be to achieve reconciliation among the East Timorese people and to prepare East Timor for effective participation in the international community. This objective can be realized only by transcending the events of the past and looking to the future. In preparing this draft resolution, we tried to stay clear of anything that might inflame sensitivities and preferred to take a different approach based on a positive outlook and on paying tribute to the cooperation shown by the parties, particularly the Indonesian Government. Without its cooperation, this process would not have been carried out in East Timor, starting with the popular consultation and ending with the adoption of its results by the Indonesian parliament. Concomitant with the above, steps were taken by the Indonesian Government, which has proved that it can assume its full responsibilities and that it does not need to be reminded of them.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">We wish to make clear our understanding of operative paragraph 12 of the draft resolution. We agree with the part of that paragraph that states that the Indonesian authorities are responsible for taking measures to ensure the return of refugees from West Timor and other parts of Indonesia to East Timor. However, we believe that the identification of the measures to be taken should be left to the Indonesian Government itself, not only because the areas mentioned are under Indonesia's control and sovereignty, but also because the Indonesian Government has demonstrated on a number of occasions that it honours its commitments. Therefore, we believe that there is no need to include the second part of operative paragraph 12.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">Despite this, and in demonstration of our cooperation with the Council, we will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us today, which was accepted by Indonesia, as was stated earlier by its representative.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. van Walsum</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">The Netherlands welcomes the People's Consultative Assembly's decision to revoke its earlier decree incorporating East Timor into Indonesia. We join other delegations in expressing our admiration for the sense of responsibility and realism that the People's Consultative Assembly of Indonesia has displayed in this matter. We cannot praise Indonesia, however, without at the same time reminding it of its continuing responsibility for the fate of the East Timorese refugees in West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia. As is stated in the draft resolution, we welcome the commitment of the Indonesian Government to allow the refugees and displaced persons in West Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia who wish to do so to return to East Timor, but we also attach the greatest importance to the following paragraph, which was already mentioned by the previous speaker, and we would like to emphasize the importance of that paragraph in full. It is the responsibility of the Indonesian authorities to ensure the safety and security of all refugees and the civilian and humanitarian character of the refugee camps and settlements, in particular by curbing the violent and intimidatory activities of the militias there.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">When we speak of the responsibility and tasks of the United Nations in East Timor to be exercised through the Transitional Administration, we should not forget that it is vitally important to involve the East Timorese themselves. The Netherlands is pleased to note that the draft resolution stresses the need for close consultation and cooperation with the East Timorese people. It is also important and logical that the civil United Nations Administration in East Timor focus on building the local capacity of the East Timorese to assume responsibility for their own democratic self-government.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">The United Nations, which in the current stage is the indispensable Organization, should, of course, endeavour to make itself superfluous. However, the United Nations should make sure that the process of handing over responsibilities to the East Timorese is carefully calibrated to correspond with the actual emergence of local capacity. Prematurely dumping responsibilities in the lap of the East Timorese people would be tantamount to abandoning them.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">At the same time, we must ensure that the military resources on the ground are commensurate with the developing security challenges in East Timor. A possible downsizing of the military force in East Timor, provided for in the current draft resolution, should take place only if and when security conditions permit.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">Along with the United Kingdom, we fully endorse the statement made by the representative of Finland on behalf of the European Union.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fonseca</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">Today the Security Council has taken another decisive step in the long and painful process leading to the self-determination of East Timor. The Brazilian people have always fully supported the goal of an independent East Timor, so for us today is a day of joy and hope.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">Brazil is one of the sponsors of the draft resolution on which we are about to vote. We believe it adequately reflects the recommendations made by the Secretary-General with regard to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">We would like to highlight operative paragraph 8 of the draft resolution, which stresses the need for UNTAET to consult and cooperate closely with the East Timorese people. The construction of a new nation is necessarily an endeavour of all the people. In the case of East Timor, the process of healing and reconciliation is a necessary condition for a smooth transition to independence. In that regard, Brazil thinks regards the role of the National Council of Timorese Resistance as being of the utmost importance.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">This is the last formal step before the United Nations fully assumes its responsibilities with regard to East Timor. Less than a week ago, the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly unanimously voted for the annulment of the measure that had annexed the Territory of East Timor. We congratulate the Indonesian Government for that timely decision.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">It is not necessary to mention individually all those who have contributed to the goal of self-determination for East Timor. My delegation would like to pay tribute to the courage of the East Timorese people in maintaining this ideal during difficulties that at times seemed insurmountable.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">Now, it is up to the international community, through the United Nations, to ensure that the future State of East Timor is built on a solid and lasting democratic foundation. Brazil is ready to contribute to this endeavour.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dejammet</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">The draft resolution that we are about to adopt provides for the creation of a United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This is an essential step; those who initiated it should be congratulated. We also congratulate the Governments of Portugal and of Indonesia, the countries of the region and all the Secretariat officials who have helped bring about this peaceful conclusion and the realization of the principle of self-determination.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">Following the popular consultation of 30 August, Indonesia and Portugal agreed to transfer authority over East Timor, in due and proper form, to the United Nations; subsequently, the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly decided to revoke the 1978 decree annexing East Timor to Indonesia. Like previous speakers, France hails this courageous and positive decision taken by Indonesia. It constitutes a milestone in East Timor's transition towards independence, a process that should be supported by the United Nations. That is the role of UNTAET, which should be responsible not only for peacekeeping, following on the activities of the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET), but also for the reconstruction of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">We welcome this ambitious mission, since it attests to the resolve of the Security Council to fully assume its responsibilities with respect to peacemaking and peacekeeping in crisis areas, wherever in the world they may be located. This mission will also be an example of the global approach to peacekeeping that takes into account the need for economic and social reconstruction in the Territory, without which the long-term stability of Timor would be imperilled.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">In order to be successful, UNTAET must be deployed and begin to carry out its mandate as early as possible. In particular, its military component should be deployed as soon as possible, as envisaged.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">The long-term stability of Timor will not depend solely on UNTAET, but also on all the parties concerned, first and foremost the people of East Timor themselves. That is why, along with other countries, we call on all the Timorese people to engage in a process of national reconciliation in order to guarantee peace, stability and respect for human rights in East Timor.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Petrella</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">Briefly, I would like to join earlier speakers in recommending unanimous support for the draft resolution that we are about to adopt and that my delegation is honoured to co-sponsor. We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his report on the situation in East Timor contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1999-1024.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/1024</a>, proposing the creation of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), as decided in operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">We support the mandate as spelled out in operative paragraph 2, as well as the objectives and the structure recommended by the Secretary-General. We wish every success to the future Special Representative, who will be responsible for all aspects of the work of the United Nations in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">It seems to me that the time has come to look to the future. The success of UNTAET is an unprecedented challenge to the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">Lastly, we wish to thank the personnel of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), whose dedication and courage demonstrated the worth of United Nations personnel and the sacrifices they are willing to make. Special appreciation goes to Ambassador Marker, whose skill and experience proved to be vital at the most acute stages of the crisis. To the people and the leaders of East Timor, we reaffirm the support and confidence the Argentine Republic.</p>

	<p id="pg016-bk03-pa01">Canada has the pleasure of co-sponsoring the draft resolution that will establish the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). In order to prepare for the transition to independence -- the path that was chosen during the popular consultation of 30 August 1999 -- the sorely tested people of East Timor needs a robust United Nations presence, which would be ensured through the adoption of the draft resolution before us today.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Duval</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk05-pa01">Three aspects of this draft resolution are of particular importance to Canada. Firstly, the fourteenth preambular paragraph calls on all parties to cooperate with investigations into reports of systematic, widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed in East Timor. One of these investigations is to be carried out by the international commission of inquiry established by the Secretary-General, as requested by a resolution of 27 September of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Canada co-sponsored that resolution, and we urge all parties, including the Government of Indonesia, to cooperate with the commission of inquiry. Justice is an integral part of reconciliation. Those who have committed crimes must be brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk05-pa02">Secondly, we wish to reaffirm that the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET), should be replaced by the peacekeeping component of UNTAET as soon as possible, as set forth in operative paragraph 9. Canada's firm view, based on our experience with multinational forces in Rwanda, Somalia, Haiti and eastern Zaire, is that this Council could, and should, have authorized, in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1264(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1264 (1999)</a> a classic United Nations-commanded peacekeeping operation for East Timor. Such a mission, with blue berets, funded through the standard peacekeeping assessment mechanism and multinational in character, could have been deployed as quickly as a multinational force. The essential factor delaying the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping operation was not operational but political.</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">Finally, I would like to emphasize the need to finance the essential elements of UNTAET through regular contributions. The piecemeal financing through voluntary contributions to special funds cannot provide the necessary financial security for the United Nations for missions such as the one we are authorizing today. The people of East Timor need that security.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">The role of UNTAET is not to administer East Timor on its own. The people of East Timor must play an integral part in the work of UNTAET. The people of East Timor finally has the opportunity to organize its own society as it wishes, and the United Nations has the duty to help it in strengthening its capacity to do so.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Burleigh</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa01">I wish to note that Ambassador Holbrooke wanted and expected to be here in the Council this morning, because East Timor is an issue of very high priority for the United States. He is not here because he has been unexpectedly called away to address the United States arrears issue, which is currently before our Congress. I trust colleagues will understand that, and the Secretary-General as well.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa02">The United States supports the draft resolution to establish the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). We applaud the decision of the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly to accept the results of the popular consultation. As President Clinton said, this historic act "shows respect for the will of the people of East Timor". This draft resolution, like the Indonesian Assembly's vote, is the right course of action. The international community must help the people of East Timor, first to rebuild their shattered lives and then to construct the institutions that they will need to become an independent State.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa03">In this regard, we stress the need for continued attention to the plight of those East Timorese who fled violence in East Timor only to face continuing intimidation in refugee camps in West Timor. They must have security in the camps, access to international assistance and the right to return home.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa04">At the same time, we emphasize the need for the United Nations to work in close consultation with the East Timorese and note with great pleasure the safe return to East Timor of Xanana Gusmão.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa05">We commend the members of the Security Council for their perseverance on East Timor. Over recent months we have worked together to support the United Nations. The United Nations response to the crisis in East Timor is an example of the potential and great promise of this institution.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa06">I should like to comment on a few elements of the draft resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa07">The Council has made appropriate arrangements for the transition from the multinational force to a United Nations peacekeeping operation. The transition will occur, as advised by the Secretary-General, taking into account the views of the Commander of the International Force, East Timor (INTERFET), and conditions on the ground. This will not prolong INTERFET's deployment, but it will ensure a safe and effective handover.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa08">The Secretary-General wisely decided to establish a trust fund for East Timor. It is a long-standing practice that peacekeeping assessments are used to support United Nations staff, peacekeeping forces and civilian police. Civil society projects sustaining a transition to independence should be supported by contributions from those who have shown such a strong interest in helping East Timor become a viable independent State.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa09">We welcome the call for all parties to cooperate with investigations into reports of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa10">The attack on civilians, United Nations staff, personnel of non-governmental organizations and journalists, as well as the forced displacement of East Timorese, were repugnant. It is imperative that credible bodies fully investigate these violations, identify those responsible and help bring them to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa11">We applaud the courage and dedication of the personnel of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET). We know those assigned to the new mission will work hard to fill their shoes. We also commend all those who contributed to the United Nations authorized multinational force, particularly Australia for assuming such a daunting leadership task.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa12">INTERFET's efforts have laid the foundation for the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa13">We look forward to working with the United Nations, the people of East Timor, President Wahid and the Government of Indonesia and our other partners to help ensure that East Timor's transition to independence is as smooth and successful as possible.</p>
