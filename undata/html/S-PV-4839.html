	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultation among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the agreement on security arrangements reached in Naivasha, Kenya, between the Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). The Council reiterates its welcome for the signing of the Machakos Protocol, which represents a viable basis for a resolution of the conflict in Sudan. The Security Council looks forward to the successful conclusion of a comprehensive peace agreement, based on the Machakos Protocol. The Council further expresses its appreciation of the key role played by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), under the leadership of the Kenyan President, the Kenyan Special Envoy, the envoys of the other IGAD member States and the International Observers in the Sudan Peace Talks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council also welcomes the continuation of the ceasefire and the establishment of the Verification and Monitoring Team, Joint Monitoring Commission and the Civilian Protection Monitoring Team and encourages Member States in a position to do so to contribute financial and logistical resources.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council assures the parties of its readiness to support them in the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement and requests the Secretary-General, in this connection, to initiate preparatory work, as soon as possible, in consultation with the parties, the IGAD facilitators and the International Observers, on how the United Nations could best fully support the implementation of a comprehensive peace agreement."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-16.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/16</a>.</p>
