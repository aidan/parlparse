	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa01">This morning, the General Assembly will proceed to the election of five members of the International Court of Justice for a nine-year term commencing on 6 February 2003. The terms of office of the following judges expire on 5 February 2003: Mr. Shi Jiuyong (China), Mr. Shigeru Oda (Japan), Mr. Géza Herczegh (Hungary), Mr. Carl-August Fleischhauer (Germany) and Mr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa02">In connection with the election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the members of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa03">I should like to confirm that, at this time, the Security Council, independently of the General Assembly, is also proceeding to elect five members of the Court. This procedure is in accordance with Article 8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa04">"The General Assembly and the Security Council shall proceed independently of one another to elect the members of the Court".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa05">Accordingly, the results of the voting in the General Assembly will not be communicated to the Security Council until five candidates have obtained the required majority in the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa06">I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The list of candidates who have been nominated by national groups is to be found in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-306.pdf">A/57/306</a>. The curricula vitae of the candidates are to be found in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-307.pdf">A/57/307</a>. The Assembly also has before it document <a href="../pdf/A-57-305.pdf">A/57/305</a>, containing a memorandum by the Secretary-General on the present composition of the Court and on the procedure to be followed in the Assembly and in the Security Council with regard to the election.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa07">In accordance with article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa08">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General Assembly are all 191 Member States. Accordingly, for the present election, 96 votes constitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa09">If in the first ballot fewer than five candidates obtain an absolute majority, it will be necessary to proceed to further ballots until five candidates have obtained that majority. Pursuant to the decision taken by the General Assembly at its 915th meeting, held on 16 November 1960, those ballots shall be unrestricted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa10">I should like to remind representatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the Assembly's rules of procedure,</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa11">"After the President has announced the beginning of voting, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order in connection with the actual conduct of the voting".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa12">Therefore, any announcements, such as those concerning withdrawals of candidatures, should be made prior to the commencement of the voting process, that is to say before the announcement of the beginning of the voting process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa13">I should like to bring another matter to the attention of the General Assembly. Cases have arisen in the Security Council in which more than the required number of candidates have obtained an absolute majority on the same ballet. The same also occurred in the General Assembly at the 45th plenary meeting of the fifty-fourth session, on 3 November 1999. The practice followed by the Security Council has been to hold a new vote on all the candidates, and the President of the Council made no notification to the President of the General Assembly until only the required number of candidates, and no more, had obtained the absolute majority in the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa14">Similarly, at the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly more than the required number of candidates obtained an absolute majority on the same ballot. The General Assembly decided to hold a new ballot on all the candidates, and the President of the General Assembly made no notification to the President of the Security Council until only the required number of candidates, and no more, had obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa15">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to the procedures I have just outlined?</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg002-bk01">
	It was so decided.

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa02">I should like to seek the usual cooperation of representatives during the conduct of the election. Please be reminded that during the voting process all campaigning should cease in the General Assembly Hall. This means in particular that once the election has begun no more campaign material can be distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also requested to remain at their seats so that the voting process can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank representatives in advance for their cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa03">We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot papers will now be distributed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa04">Representatives are requested to use only the ballot papers now being distributed. Only those candidates whose names appear on the ballot papers are eligible. Representatives will indicate the five candidates for whom they wish to vote by placing crosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers. Ballot papers on which more than five names are marked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names appear on the ballot papers.</div>
