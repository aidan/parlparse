<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk09">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">"The Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-501.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/501</a>), as well as the briefing by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, Mr. Atul Khare, on 19 August 2008.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">"The Security Council commends the political leadership and State institutions of Timor-Leste for the rapid, firm and responsible manner that respected constitutional procedures of the country, in which they responded to the deplorable events of 11 February 2008. The Council acknowledges that while progress has been made in the overall security situation in Timor-Leste since the events of May-June 2006, the political, security, social and humanitarian situation in the country remains fragile.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the continued efforts to foster dialogue and national reconciliation in Timor-Leste through various mechanisms, in particular the expanded High-level Coordination meetings, the Trilateral Coordination Forum, as well as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General's continued good offices. The Council also welcomes recent progress in addressing the situation of the internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms the continued importance of the review and reform of the security sector in Timor-Leste, in particular the need to ensure clear separation of internal and external security roles and responsibilities between the National Police (PNTL) and the military, to strengthen legal frameworks and to enhance civilian oversight and accountability mechanisms. The Security Council recognizes efforts made by the national authorities and UNMIT for the reconstitution of the National Police of Timor-Leste and welcomes the report of the expert mission to Timor-Leste on policing of 16 May 2008 (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-329.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/329</a>) and the necessary steps taken to implement the recommendations of the report. The Council underlines that the building of an independent, professional and impartial national police service in Timor-Leste is a long-term process, that national ownership is a central element in this regard, and that UNMIT has a key role to play in helping to ensure that the PNTL is ready and able to resume its policing responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council recalls the need for the sustained support of the international community to Timor-Leste to develop and strengthen its institutions and to further build capacities in the justice sector.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council further reaffirms the importance of ongoing efforts to reach accountability and justice, and underlines the importance of the implementation of the recommendations of the Independent Special Commission of Inquiry report of 2006 by the Government of Timor-Leste. It welcomes the conviction of the leaders of Timor-Leste on the need for justice and their determination to act against impunity. The Council underscores the importance of the promotion and protection of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council recognizes the need to address socio-economic challenges in Timor-Leste. In this regard, the Council welcomes the launching of the national priorities for 2008 by the Government of Timor-Leste, including public safety and security, social protection and solidarity, addressing the needs of youths, employment and income generation, improving social service delivery, and greater transparency and effective Government. It also welcomes the signing between Timor-Leste and the United Nations of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework 2009-2013, which can provide the country with an important instrument on its path to development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council reaffirms its full support for UNMIT in its work and appreciates the continued efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to ensure the full implementation of the mandate of UNMIT. It encourages UNMIT, in accordance with its mandate, to continue to cooperate with the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes as well as all relevant partners to support the Government of Timor-Leste. The Council recalls its requests to the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Government of Timor-Leste, to develop a medium-term strategy with appropriate benchmarks to measure and track progress and to submit further reports as and when he considers appropriate."</p>
