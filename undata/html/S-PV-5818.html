	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations. Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the deployment of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, <a href="../pdf/S-2007-759.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2007/759</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest possible terms the 7 January attack by elements of the Sudanese Armed Forces, as confirmed by the African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), on a UNAMID supply convoy. The Security Council stresses that any attack on or threat against UNAMID is unacceptable, and demands that there will be no recurrence of attacks on UNAMID. The Security Council welcomes the commitment of the Government of the Sudan to undertake a complete and full investigation into the incident, together with the United Nations/African Union.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the transition of authority from the African Union peacekeeping operation (AMIS) to UNAMID, which occurred on 31 December. The Security Council commends AMIS for its prompt action to begin to re-establish peace and security in Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Council calls on the Government of the Sudan to expedite full compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1769 (2007)</a>, including through concluding all the necessary arrangements for the expeditious deployment of an effective UNAMIID force.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Council further urges the Government of the Sudan and all armed groups to respect an immediate and complete ceasefire and demands that all parties cooperate fully with the deployment of UNAMID and respect its security and freedom of movement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates that an inclusive political settlement and the successful deployment of UNAMID are essential for re-establishing peace and stability in Darfur. The Security Council urges all parties, including rebel groups, to engage fully and constructively in the political process under the leadership of United Nations Special Envoy Mr. Jan Eliasson and African Union Special Envoy Dr. Salim Salim, who have the Council's full support. The Security Council expresses its readiness to take action against any party that impedes the peace process, humanitarian aid or the deployment of UNAMID. The Council also recognizes that due processes must take their course.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Council expresses concern about the deterioration of security and humanitarian conditions in Darfur and calls upon the United Nations and all Member States to facilitate the rapid and complete deployment of UNAMID. The Council urges capable Member States to contribute the helicopter and transportation units necessary to ensure the successful implementation of UNAMID's mandate."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-1.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
