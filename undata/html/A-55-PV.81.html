	<div class="p">I have the honour to present for consideration the following reports of the Third Committee on the agenda items allocated to it by the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 103, entitled "Social development, including questions relating to the world social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled persons and the family", the Third Committee recommends in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-591">A/55/591</a>, paragraph 9, the adoption of one draft resolution.</div>

	<div class="p">I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to paragraph 14 of the report, which falls under the discussion of draft resolution A/C.3/55/L.8/Rev.1, entitled "Combating the criminal misuse of information technologies". In that paragraph, the names of Norway and Venezuela should be added to the list of sponsors.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, I would also like to draw the attention of the Assembly to a correction in draft resolution V, on page 15 of <a href="../pdf/A-55-593">A/55/593</a>, last preambular paragraph, beginning "<i>Noting</i> the work". The title of the Committee should read "Committee of Experts on Crime in" -- not "and" -- "Cyberspace of the Council of Europe". In the same paragraph, after "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland", "in May 1998" should read "on 17 May 1998".</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 106, entitled "International drug control", the Third Committee recommends in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-594">A/55/594</a>, paragraph 7, the adoption of one draft resolution.</div>

	<div class="p">I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to part III of the report. In draft resolution I, entitled "Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour", the following corrections should be made to the text to bring it into line with the text of A/C.3/55/L.11/Rev.1, as it was before the Third Committee at the time of its adoption.</div>
	<div class="p">In the third preambular paragraph, the phrase "a common feature of which is premeditation," should be deleted, and the phrase "and that the failure to do so constitutes a human rights violation" should be added to the end of the same paragraph.</div>
	<div class="p">The following paragraph should be inserted after the fourth preambular paragraph:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"<i>Noting</i> general recommendation 19 concerning violence against women adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women".</div>
	<div class="p">In the seventh preambular paragraph, the words "awareness campaigns through print and electronic media, as well as educational programmes, are required to underline" should be deleted and replaced by "fundamental changes in societal attitudes are required, and underlining".</div>
	<div class="p">In operative paragraph 1, the word "crimes" before "that are identified in the outcome document" should be deleted and replaced by the word "those". The phrase "a common feature of which is premeditation", which appears after "including crimes against women committed in the name of honour", should be deleted.</div>
	<div class="p">In operative paragraph 7, after the phrase "elimination of the crimes in question", the phrase "and on the issue of crimes of passion" should be deleted.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 108, entitled "Implementation of the outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women and of the special session of the General Assembly entitled `Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century'", the Third Committee recommends in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-596">A/55/596</a>, paragraph 10, the adoption of one draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 109, entitled "Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, questions relating to refugees, returnees and displaced persons and humanitarian questions", the Committee recommends in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-597">A/55/597</a>*, paragraph 25, the adoption of six draft resolutions and, in paragraph 26, the adoption of one draft decision. I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to paragraph 21 of the report, which falls under the discussion of draft decision A/C.3/55/L.70, entitled "Assistance to refugees, returnees and displaced persons in Africa". In that paragraph, the name of Japan should be added to the list of sponsors.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 110, entitled "Promotion and protection of the rights of children", the Third Committee recommends in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-598">A/55/598</a>, paragraph 14, the adoption of two draft resolutions and, in paragraph 15, the adoption of one draft decision.

	<div class="p">I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to revisions in draft resolution V, entitled "Situation of human rights in Cambodia". The word "Mr." should be inserted before the name Thomas Hammarberg in paragraph 4 and before the name Peter Leuprecht in paragraph 5.

	<div class="p">Under agenda item 114 (c), entitled "Human rights questions: human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives", the Committee recommends, in paragraph 49 of document <a href="../pdf/A-55-602-Add.3">A/55/602/Add.3</a>, the adoption of eight draft resolutions. In connection with that report, I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to a correction to draft resolution VI, entitled "Situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo". In the sixth preambular paragraph, the word "all" before the word "parties" should be deleted.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 114 (d), entitled "Human rights questions: comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action", the Committee indicates in its report contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-602-Add.4">A/55/602/Add.4</a> that no draft proposals were submitted and no action taken under that sub-item.</div>

	<div class="p">The delegation of the Dominican Republic profoundly regrets that it has been necessary to postpone the adoption of draft resolution VI in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-595">A/55/595</a>, on the critical situation of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), to a later stage of the fifty-fifth session. My delegation has joined the consensus regarding the report in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-595">A/55/595</a>, on the advancement of women, only because you, Mr. President, have assured us that the draft text on INSTRAW, together with the recommendations of the Fifth Committee on the financial implications, will be presented at a later date before the General Assembly recesses in December.</div>
	<div class="p">It is our delegation's understanding that, on the basis of paragraph 6 of the draft resolution on INSTRAW, the Institute will be provided with resources so that it can continue its activities throughout 2001. It is also our understanding, on the basis of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-250">resolution 54/250</a>, that these resources could come from the contingency fund, which, at the end of the fifty-fourth session, had $16,362,700.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, it is to be regretted that the Third Committee presented its report to the General Assembly in plenary meeting without taking into account the provisions of rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. The delegation of the Dominican Republic hopes that an omission of this kind will not be repeated in the future.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">My delegation abstained in the voting on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-66">resolution 55/66</a>, as, early on in the discussions, my delegation believed it was crucial that we include the term "premeditated" before the word "crimes" in the third preambular paragraph and in operative paragraph 1 of the resolution. Without the inclusion of the term "premeditated" in these paragraphs, the scope can include crimes committed in sudden bursts of rage in reaction to particular circumstances. Or, to put this another way, it would include implicitly not only those crimes that fall within the broad understanding of this resolution, but also those that overlap with crimes of passion.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation fervently believes that there should not have been any half measures here. If passion is intended, then passion should be mentioned, and the scope of the resolution be broadened explicitly. If passion is not intended, there should have been no difficulty for the membership to accept "premeditation" in the text, since it is a common feature of the crime anyway. This would have added precision where precision is needed. Without this, the result is, of course, utterly illogical.</div>
	<div class="p">In the third preambular paragraph States are reminded that they have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, punish, and so forth. How could States possibly exercise due diligence to prevent such crimes if the crime in question is committed in a sudden state of rage? All States in which there are crimes of passion would in due course leave themselves open to potential accusations of human rights violations for not having exercised enough due diligence to prevent the commission of such crimes.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to emphasize my delegation's willingness to work in the future towards bridging the gaps on this issue. We look forward to expressing our views regarding the upcoming Secretary-General's report.</div>

	<div class="p">I refer to the draft resolution entitled "Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees". To date, such draft resolutions have always been adopted by consensus. The main purpose of the draft resolution is to express the support of all Member countries for the work of the High Commissioner. At a time when the tasks entrusted to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are more challenging than ever, and refugees all over the world depend on the assistance provided by UNHCR, the best way to express solidarity with the plight of refugees and the work of UNHCR would be to adopt the draft resolution on this subject by consensus again this year.</div>
	<div class="p">A vote on a specific paragraph at this time is particularly regrettable, bearing in mind that this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of UNHCR. Furthermore, it should be recalled that the paragraph on which a vote has been requested contains agreed language from <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-146">resolution 54/146</a>, which was adopted by consensus at the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Based on these considerations, Norway supports the draft resolution, will vote in favour of the paragraph and hopes other Member countries will express their support for UNHCR by doing the same. We hope the current situation will be an exception and that it will not lead to any precedents with regard to resolutions on this important subject.</div>

	Mr. Carp (United States)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The Government of the United States will join the consensus on draft resolution II, entitled "The rights of the child", because we want to reaffirm our commitment to protecting those who are most vulnerable, our children. Overall, we believe that this draft resolution contributes to that process. We note with regret, however, that we disagree with the sponsors on certain paragraphs; most notably with paragraph 8 of section V. We are deeply disappointed that we were unable to arrive at a compromise on the language in that paragraph.</div>
	<div class="p">In January this year, the United States, along with many Member States, had the honour to participate at Geneva in the Working Group on a draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. The result was a major step in the protection of children, of which we can all be very proud.</div>
	<div class="p">The language in paragraph 8 of section V of the draft resolution does not take into account the fact that the questions of the age of military recruitment and participation in armed conflict were resolved in Convention No. 182 of the International Labour Organization and in the Optional Protocol. We strongly believe that any language in United Nations resolutions referring to the above-mentioned issue should accurately reflect not only the most recent but, arguably, the most significant progress in the development of legal instruments to protect children.</div>
	<div class="p">While the language in paragraph 8 does not alter in any way the legal obligations of these two singular treaties, we maintain that, in the interest of accuracy, any language that refers to these issues should be in line with the language that so many of us negotiated over such a long period of time. That said, our efforts now are best directed towards ensuring compliance by States parties and at persuading non-parties to improve their practices and consider signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol. In that way, we will truly be working towards our common goal of protecting the world's children.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">We truly appreciate the hard work and the real spirit of compromise shown by everyone in order to reach the degree of consensus we have attained with these texts on the elimination of racial discrimination. Such a cooperative spirit bodes well for the upcoming World Conference against Racism. The United States knows the tragedy of racism first-hand. We are committed to combating it in all its manifestations, both at home and abroad. We look forward to the World Conference, and we are working hard to make it a success.</div>
	<div class="p">However, unfortunately, there are some elements in these draft resolutions that trouble us and keep us from becoming co-sponsors. Specifically, we are concerned about references that are inconsistent with the First Amendment rights set out in our Constitution, concerning freedom of speech. Thus, while we may denounce certain opinions, the right to express them is guaranteed by our Constitution. The United States took a limited reservation to that effect under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, we do not believe the General Assembly has the power to direct States to ratify treaties or conventions. We would prefer urging States to consider ratification or accession.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, while we support the use of all appropriate measures to combat racism, "all available measures" are mentioned in the draft resolution. In our view, that is an overly broad formulation that could be subject to misinterpretation.</div>

	<div class="p">My delegation voted in favour of draft resolution II, on the protection of migrants, and supports its general thrust. However, we wish to express some concern over operative paragraph 4, which has several implications for national immigration policy and by extension, for social and economic development. Jamaica supports the welfare and protection of migrants. However, economic circumstances often do not allow for the accommodation of an influx of migrant workers. The revision and review of immigration policy is a matter within the domestic jurisdiction of each State. National immigration policy is also conditioned by the availability of resources and the economic and social conditions which prevail.</div>

	<div class="p">The Chilean delegation has joined in the consensus on the adoption of the draft resolution on human rights and cultural diversity. Nevertheless, it has serious reservations about the relevance of including the theme of cultural diversity in the context of human rights. My country firmly respects the coexistence of various cultural systems in the international arena; it could not be otherwise regarding a country like Chile, where cultures of such diverse origins coexist. Nevertheless, we feel that the question of cultural diversity pertains to other areas of United Nations efforts, not to human rights.</div>
	<div class="p">The great legacy of the twentieth century is the recognition and validation of the principle of the universality of human rights. For Chile, the universality of human rights means incorporating the inherent dignity of all inhabitants of the planet, independent of their culture, religion, social status, ethnic origin, gender or traditions. Neither lack of development nor cultural differences can be invoked to justify limits on human rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as the rest of the conventions which comprise the universal system for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Opening a debate on the question of human rights and cultural diversity could mean, in our delegation's view, a step backward in the universality and implementation of these rights.</div>

	<div class="p">Democracy has now become a characteristic feature of modern Yemen. This has led us to take a strong and clear position on several political issues regarding strengthening of human rights at the national and international levels.</div>
	<div class="p">We would like to confirm our full respect for international instruments, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and international humanitarian law in general. We believe that human rights are an indivisible whole and should not be selective. Hence we condemn any violations of human rights wherever they occur, without any exception. Any politicization of human rights issues means using them as a tool against individual countries and for purposes unrelated to noble human rights issues. We reject selectivity and double standards and do not believe in targeting any individual religions or other related issues.</div>

	<div class="p">The Government of Papua New Guinea considers that the rule of law is fundamental to the protection and promotion of human rights. In this regard, democratic institutions cannot flourish where political expediency may appear to legitimize arbitrary administrative actions contrary to the principle of the rule of law. In other words, Papua New Guinea considers arbitrary administrative actions as inimical to democratic values, norms and institutions and threatens the very basis and fundamentals of the rule of law.

My delegation is aware of positive elements that indicate greater progress in the efforts of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to implement human rights in that country. But the Government of Bolivia notes with concern that since 1996, no invitation has yet been extended by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights to visit the country. Such a visit would make it possible to obtain more official information on the situation on human rights in Iran, which of course is the subject of the draft resolution and of the recommendations it contains.</div>
