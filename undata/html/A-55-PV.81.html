	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I should like to inform members that the representative of the Dominican Republic has expressed the desire to make a statement in connection with the report of the Third Committee on agenda item 107, "Advancement of women", contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-55-595.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/595</a> and corrigenda 1 and 2.

	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa04">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa05">May I remind delegations too that, also in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa06">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Third Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Third Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified otherwise in advance. That means that, where a recorded vote or separate vote was taken, we will do the same. I would also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Third Committee.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk12-pa01">The delegation of the Dominican Republic profoundly regrets that it has been necessary to postpone the adoption of draft resolution VI in <a href="../pdf/A-55-595.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/595</a>, on the critical situation of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), to a later stage of the fifty-fifth session. My delegation has joined the consensus regarding the report in <a href="../pdf/A-55-595.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/595</a>, on the advancement of women, only because you, Mr. President, have assured us that the draft text on INSTRAW, together with the recommendations of the Fifth Committee on the financial implications, will be presented at a later date before the General Assembly recesses in December.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk12-pa02">It is our delegation's understanding that, on the basis of paragraph 6 of the draft resolution on INSTRAW, the Institute will be provided with resources so that it can continue its activities throughout 2001. It is also our understanding, on the basis of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-250.pdf" class="nolink">resolution 54/250</a>, that these resources could come from the contingency fund, which, at the end of the fifty-fourth session, had $16,362,700.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk12-pa03">Finally, it is to be regretted that the Third Committee presented its report to the General Assembly in plenary meeting without taking into account the provisions of rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. The delegation of the Dominican Republic hopes that an omission of this kind will not be repeated in the future.</p>

There is no other international treaty law that has a bearing on reservations.</p>

These crimes are not confined to any particular people or region. We believe that crimes called "crimes of honour" are crimes against people. Hence, we have reservations on the draft resolution entitled "Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour", and we shall abstain in the voting.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk15-pa01">My delegation abstained in the voting on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-66.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/66</a>, as, early on in the discussions, my delegation believed it was crucial that we include the term "premeditated" before the word "crimes" in the third preambular paragraph and in operative paragraph 1 of the resolution. Without the inclusion of the term "premeditated" in these paragraphs, the scope can include crimes committed in sudden bursts of rage in reaction to particular circumstances. Or, to put this another way, it would include implicitly not only those crimes that fall within the broad understanding of this resolution, but also those that overlap with crimes of passion.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk15-pa02">My delegation fervently believes that there should not have been any half measures here. If passion is intended, then passion should be mentioned, and the scope of the resolution be broadened explicitly. If passion is not intended, there should have been no difficulty for the membership to accept "premeditation" in the text, since it is a common feature of the crime anyway. This would have added precision where precision is needed. Without this, the result is, of course, utterly illogical.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk15-pa03">In the third preambular paragraph States are reminded that they have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, punish, and so forth. How could States possibly exercise due diligence to prevent such crimes if the crime in question is committed in a sudden state of rage? All States in which there are crimes of passion would in due course leave themselves open to potential accusations of human rights violations for not having exercised enough due diligence to prevent the commission of such crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk15-pa04">I wish to emphasize my delegation's willingness to work in the future towards bridging the gaps on this issue. We look forward to expressing our views regarding the upcoming Secretary-General's report.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk10-pa01">I refer to the draft resolution entitled "Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees". To date, such draft resolutions have always been adopted by consensus. The main purpose of the draft resolution is to express the support of all Member countries for the work of the High Commissioner. At a time when the tasks entrusted to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are more challenging than ever, and refugees all over the world depend on the assistance provided by UNHCR, the best way to express solidarity with the plight of refugees and the work of UNHCR would be to adopt the draft resolution on this subject by consensus again this year.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk10-pa02">A vote on a specific paragraph at this time is particularly regrettable, bearing in mind that this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of UNHCR. Furthermore, it should be recalled that the paragraph on which a vote has been requested contains agreed language from <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-146.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 54/146</a>, which was adopted by consensus at the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Based on these considerations, Norway supports the draft resolution, will vote in favour of the paragraph and hopes other Member countries will express their support for UNHCR by doing the same. We hope the current situation will be an exception and that it will not lead to any precedents with regard to resolutions on this important subject.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk14-pa01">The Government of the United States will join the consensus on draft resolution II, entitled "The rights of the child", because we want to reaffirm our commitment to protecting those who are most vulnerable, our children. Overall, we believe that this draft resolution contributes to that process. We note with regret, however, that we disagree with the sponsors on certain paragraphs; most notably with paragraph 8 of section V. We are deeply disappointed that we were unable to arrive at a compromise on the language in that paragraph.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk14-pa02">In January this year, the United States, along with many Member States, had the honour to participate at Geneva in the Working Group on a draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. The result was a major step in the protection of children, of which we can all be very proud.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk14-pa03">The language in paragraph 8 of section V of the draft resolution does not take into account the fact that the questions of the age of military recruitment and participation in armed conflict were resolved in Convention No. 182 of the International Labour Organization and in the Optional Protocol. We strongly believe that any language in United Nations resolutions referring to the above-mentioned issue should accurately reflect not only the most recent but, arguably, the most significant progress in the development of legal instruments to protect children.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk14-pa04">While the language in paragraph 8 does not alter in any way the legal obligations of these two singular treaties, we maintain that, in the interest of accuracy, any language that refers to these issues should be in line with the language that so many of us negotiated over such a long period of time. That said, our efforts now are best directed towards ensuring compliance by States parties and at persuading non-parties to improve their practices and consider signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol. In that way, we will truly be working towards our common goal of protecting the world's children.</p>

	<p id="pg011-bk16-pa01">We truly appreciate the hard work and the real spirit of compromise shown by everyone in order to reach the degree of consensus we have attained with these texts on the elimination of racial discrimination. Such a cooperative spirit bodes well for the upcoming World Conference against Racism. The United States knows the tragedy of racism first-hand. We are committed to combating it in all its manifestations, both at home and abroad. We look forward to the World Conference, and we are working hard to make it a success.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk16-pa02">However, unfortunately, there are some elements in these draft resolutions that trouble us and keep us from becoming co-sponsors. Specifically, we are concerned about references that are inconsistent with the First Amendment rights set out in our Constitution, concerning freedom of speech. Thus, while we may denounce certain opinions, the right to express them is guaranteed by our Constitution. The United States took a limited reservation to that effect under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk16-pa03">Secondly, we do not believe the General Assembly has the power to direct States to ratify treaties or conventions. We would prefer urging States to consider ratification or accession.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk16-pa04">Furthermore, while we support the use of all appropriate measures to combat racism, "all available measures" are mentioned in the draft resolution. In our view, that is an overly broad formulation that could be subject to misinterpretation.</p>

Ghana is not a sponsor of draft resolution X concerning the right to universal freedom of travel and the vital importance of family reunification.</p>

The last correction announced, for paragraph 29, was not quite what was intended in the draft resolution in the Third Committee. The word "asks" will replace "requests" in front of the words "the Government of Cambodia", which appear in the third line of the English version, and not the "requests" in front of "the office of the United Nations High Commissioner".</p>

However, we wish to express some concern over operative paragraph 4, which has several implications for national immigration policy and by extension, for social and economic development. Jamaica supports the welfare and protection of migrants. However, economic circumstances often do not allow for the accommodation of an influx of migrant workers. The revision and review of immigration policy is a matter within the domestic jurisdiction of each State. National immigration policy is also conditioned by the availability of resources and the economic and social conditions which prevail.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa02">The Chilean delegation has joined in the consensus on the adoption of the draft resolution on human rights and cultural diversity. Nevertheless, it has serious reservations about the relevance of including the theme of cultural diversity in the context of human rights. My country firmly respects the coexistence of various cultural systems in the international arena; it could not be otherwise regarding a country like Chile, where cultures of such diverse origins coexist. Nevertheless, we feel that the question of cultural diversity pertains to other areas of United Nations efforts, not to human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa03">The great legacy of the twentieth century is the recognition and validation of the principle of the universality of human rights. For Chile, the universality of human rights means incorporating the inherent dignity of all inhabitants of the planet, independent of their culture, religion, social status, ethnic origin, gender or traditions. Neither lack of development nor cultural differences can be invoked to justify limits on human rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as the rest of the conventions which comprise the universal system for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Opening a debate on the question of human rights and cultural diversity could mean, in our delegation's view, a step backward in the universality and implementation of these rights.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk08-pa01">Democracy has now become a characteristic feature of modern Yemen. This has led us to take a strong and clear position on several political issues regarding strengthening of human rights at the national and international levels.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk08-pa02">We would like to confirm our full respect for international instruments, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and international humanitarian law in general. We believe that human rights are an indivisible whole and should not be selective. Hence we condemn any violations of human rights wherever they occur, without any exception. Any politicization of human rights issues means using them as a tool against individual countries and for purposes unrelated to noble human rights issues. We reject selectivity and double standards and do not believe in targeting any individual religions or other related issues.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk08-pa03">Accordingly, my delegation will not vote on all the draft resolutions on human rights in all countries, without exception, as set out in <a href="../pdf/A-55-602-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/602/Add.3</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk09-pa02">The Government of Papua New Guinea considers that the rule of law is fundamental to the protection and promotion of human rights. In this regard, democratic institutions cannot flourish where political expediency may appear to legitimize arbitrary administrative actions contrary to the principle of the rule of law. In other words, Papua New Guinea considers arbitrary administrative actions as inimical to democratic values, norms and institutions and threatens the very basis and fundamentals of the rule of law.

My delegation is aware of positive elements that indicate greater progress in the efforts of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to implement human rights in that country. But the Government of Bolivia notes with concern that since 1996, no invitation has yet been extended by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights to visit the country. Such a visit would make it possible to obtain more official information on the situation on human rights in Iran, which of course is the subject of the draft resolution and of the recommendations it contains.</p>
