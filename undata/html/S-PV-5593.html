<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vassilakis</span> <span class="nation">Greece</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">Today is the last time that Greece will participate, in its capacity as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, in a meeting on an issue of the utmost importance for my country: Cyprus. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to express my country's most heartfelt appreciation, first of all, to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and to the Department for Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the Secretariat in general for all their hard work and their contribution to maintaining stability on the island, which is so necessary for the promotion of any solution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">We also thank greatly all troop-contributing countries for their continued presence. We all understand very well the magnitude of the ever-increasing global demands on United Nations peacekeeping resources, and we are mindful of the need to ensure that UNFICYP does not stay one day more than is absolutely necessary. We sincerely hope that that day will come very soon. In the meanwhile, though, and in the absence of a comprehensive settlement and the withdrawal of all occupation troops from the island, UNFICYP is necessary, and the contribution of the United Nations is highly appreciated and, of course, never taken for granted.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">Greece shows that appreciation in practical terms as well, by providing, on a voluntary basis, a substantial amount of money for UNFICYP. That contribution and the one third share of the expenses contributed by the Government of Cyprus amount to 50 per cent of the Force's yearly budget.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">The Cyprus problem is a long-standing and complicated one. But, despite many, and quite intensive, efforts over the years, unfortunately, 32 years after the Turkish military invasion, its resolution remains elusive. We remain hopeful that the lessons drawn from our past efforts will not be in vain and that, instead, they will guide us -- all of us -- in the search for a functional and workable solution acceptable to all and desired by all. This will lead to a better future for all of the citizens of Cyprus and will contribute to peace and stability in the entire region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa05">A Cypriot-owned solution through a Cypriot-owned process with the invaluable assistance of the international community: that is the way forward. We know it is a difficult way. There might be setbacks, and patience will be a quality in great demand. But we should always bear in mind that no step is too small if it is in the right, forward-looking, direction. Step-by-step approaches could lead to major breakthroughs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa06">We all agree that the present status quo is unsustainable. The two communities have also agreed on the basic form of the reunification of the island: a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. We now have to build upon what has already been achieved. The 8 July agreement gives us a platform on which to work carefully to prepare the ground so that we can achieve the necessary progress that will allow the entire political process to move forward and lead to a comprehensive, permanent and durable settlement: a settlement that respects international legality and conforms with both the relevant United Nations resolutions and the norms and principles of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa07">In closing, I would like to thank the members of the Security Council for their close cooperation and their understanding of the difficulties of a particularly complex problem -- especially, if one takes into account the sensitivities involved in this particular case, which has deep roots in history and is tightly interwoven with larger geopolitical realities.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">I should like to inform the Council that, in my capacity as President of the Council, I have met with the representatives of the parties, who have confirmed to me that they maintain their well-known positions vis-à-vis the item on the Council's agenda. On the basis of those meetings, as President, with the consent of the members of the Council, I have drawn the conclusion that the Council can proceed to take a decision on the draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-978.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/978</a>) before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.</p>
