<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Van Dunem Mbinda</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">It is always a great honour to be able to address the Security Council, especially now, when the situation in my country is once again the focus of its attention.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola, and in my own name, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month and for the wisdom and diplomatic experience that you have demonstrated.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I also salute your predecessor, Ambassador Ibrahim Gambari, for the excellent work he performed, which contributed to reaffirming the Council's commitment to the search for a just and lasting solution to the Angolan conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Permit me also to express my Government's acknowledgment of the commendable efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and in particular his Special Representative, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, whose spirit and dedication and diplomatic skill have made possible important advances in the Angolan peace talks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">I must also reiterate the appreciation of the Government and people of Angola of the Government and people of Zambia, and especially President Frederick Chiluba, for their continued willingness to host the peace talks, and of the member countries of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity and the troika of observers - Portugal, Russia and the United States - for the significant contribution they have made to the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">I also wish to emphasize the quality of the Secretary-General's report, whose recommendations my Government fully supports, although at the end of my statement I would like to make a few comments on behalf of my Government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">When, about a month ago, my Government decided, in yet another gesture of flexibility, to accept the proposal of mediation of the peace talks, providing for greater participation by UNITA at the level of central, provincial and local government and in foreign affairs, it was in the firm conviction that UNITA would respond in like manner, thereby overcoming the obstacles to the rapid conclusion of an agreement in Lusaka, with the restoration of peace in Angola shortly becoming a reality.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">However, UNITA instead responded with further demands, thus clearly demonstrating its lack of willingness to find a negotiated solution and presenting a challenge to the intensive efforts of the Government, the mediation and the observer countries aimed at the cessation of the bloody and destructive war, which UNITA started and persists in continuing.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">The Council has been witness to the successive concessions made by the Government throughout the negotiating process, nearly always without a proper response from UNITA, despite its having violated the peace platforms that it signed as well as the constitution and other laws of the Angolan State. For this reason, it would be unfair for other concessions to be demanded of the Angolan Government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">It is now up to UNITA to demonstrate political will and show that it is truly interested in a just, peaceful and lasting solution, one that is not achieved by force of arms. My Government's latest offer constitutes an indivisible and balanced package, taking into account all the sensitive issues of national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">The international community must call UNITA to follow the path of reason and continue to pressure it to embrace peace and democracy. It is up to the Security Council to use all the means at its disposal to prevent UNITA's intransigence leading to the failure of the opportunity for peace now offered in the Lusaka talks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">In that context, my Government firmly supports the measures referred to in paragraph 5 of the draft resolution, although it considers the grace period to be excessive; the measures should be imposed automatically, as we have been negotiating in Lusaka for about eight months now, having already covered more than 90 per cent of the questions on the agenda. The sole remaining question is that of a positive and immediate response from UNITA on the outstanding item concerning national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">We think it is high time to put an end once and for all to UNITA's non-compliance with the decisions of this body; the impunity it enjoys encourages UNITA to make absurd, inappropriate and unacceptable demands and to adopt delaying tactics.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">My Government therefore favours setting a deadline for completion of the talks, in order to prevent the process from dragging on and stretching the international community's patience to its limits.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">Nevertheless, I would like to reaffirm that the Angolan Government will persevere in the search for a just resolution of the conflict, one that takes into account the Bicesse Peace Accords and other agreed platforms, the relevant Security Council resolutions and the laws of Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">As I said earlier, we would like to make a few remarks on some paragraphs in the report of the Secretary-General, with a view to promoting a better understanding of the truth of what is now taking place in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">Our few corrections refer mainly to the statement that the Government has not demonstrated the political will to conclude an agreement that would lead to the end of the war. That part of the report is self-contradictory, and also contradicts a paragraph in which appreciation is expressed for the positive gesture of the Government in accepting the mediation proposal. Moreover, the Government, although it enjoys full legitimacy, moved forward as quickly as possible to conclude a negotiated agreement in Lusaka by presenting a compromise package.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">Moreover, referring to a communiqué containing an appeal to donor countries, we would like to remind the Council that it is the escalation of military activities that endangers the speedy conclusion of a Lusaka agreement, not the reverse. The war continues, with the risk of escalation, precisely because there has not to date been agreement on a cease-fire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">We would like to recall that the cease-fire agreed upon in Portugal on 31 May 1991 was violated from the beginning by UNITA, because the outcome was not in its favour. UNITA has not accepted the electoral results and has been taking action, including war, to occupy parts of the territory of Angola, holding the population hostage.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">UNITA's rejection of mediation proposals reveals its intention to continue the war, with the aim of gaining a political advantage at the negotiating table. That has been UNITA's thinking ever since it resumed the conflict in my country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">As members know, UNITA occupied the cities of Uige, Ndalatando and Negage during the Abidjan talks; this followed the occupation of Huambo during the failed Addis Ababa talks. Given this situation, the Government could not stand idly by and fail in its responsibility to guarantee the security of the population.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa22">Another error in the report of the Secretary-General to which I want to call attention concerns the suggestion that the Government was responsible for stopping the distribution of humanitarian aid. That does not correspond to reality; the Government has never attacked the means of distribution of humanitarian aid of the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross or other non-governmental organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa23">The report asserts that the Government has impeded this help; yet it is our position that aid can be forwarded impartially to populations in need as a result of the war being waged by UNITA. My Government is very uneasy about the report's references to it, when the facts testify to very good working coordination between the Government and the non-governmental organizations that are alleviating the suffering of the population. On the other hand, UNITA's sole intention throughout the territory of Angola is to endanger this help and undermine the security provided by the Angolan armed forces.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa24">The facts reveal that UNITA does not permit UNAVEM aircraft or aid convoys to carry out their humanitarian aid operations; it has always subjected aircraft and vehicles to attack, as very recently occurred with the destruction of a 15-vehicle convoy of the World Food Programme, which occurred in Benguela, in the Ganda area, where military operations are not taking place.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa25">Given those considerations with respect to the report, it is important that when analysing the situation in Angola we take account of the reality and the objectives, so that errors in assessments of the situation do not result in benefits to the warmongers who are delaying a rapid solution of the armed conflict in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa26">Finally, on behalf of my Government, I would like to reiterate its willingness and that of my delegation to spare no effort to help find a speedy solution leading to peace, stability and national reconciliation, in keeping with our moral and political responsibility.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Angola for the kind words he addressed to me and to my predecessor, the Ambassador of Nigeria.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Last month, when we adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-922(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 922 (1994)</a>, my delegation expressed the hope that the Security Council would now be turning its attention to the issue of how an expanded United Nations presence could best contribute to a comprehensive peace settlement in the sister country of Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">My delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution, since it represents yet another attempt by the international community to bring about peace. It reflects a renewed and decisive commitment to bring an end to the tragic Angolan conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">It gives me great pleasure to welcome once again Ambassador Van Dunem &quot;Mbinda&quot; of Angola. His presence here among us and his statement are clear evidence of his Government's commitment to the goal of national reconciliation and peace in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">We continue to believe that the negotiations in Lusaka are in the final stages and that their successful conclusion is within reach. More than ever, political will, flexibility and, above all, good faith should be fully displayed by UNITA, in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">It is encouraging to learn from the Secretary-General that, at the current stage, the parties are probably closer to reaching a comprehensive peace agreement than they have been at any time since the implementation of the Bicesse Accords broke down in late 1992.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Although the pace of progress in the Lusaka talks has been slower than we all would have wished, my delegation remains convinced that the outstanding issues can be resolved expeditiously once agreement is reached on the question pertaining to UNITA's participation in the management of State affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">My Government welcomed wholeheartedly the positive response of the Government of Angola to the proposals on national reconciliation by the mediation. We reiterate our call to UNITA to act likewise immediately. The positive response we have been expecting for over a month will allow the Government of Angola and UNITA to finalize the agreement that will put an end to the armed conflict that has devastated that country for almost two decades.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The continuation of war in Angola has exacted a heavy toll on the civilian population and has brought about a humanitarian crisis of huge proportions. This is why the international community in general, and the Security Council in particular, are calling for decisive action to restore peace within the framework of the &quot;Acordos de Paz&quot; and the relevant resolutions of the Council. We remain optimistic that ongoing efforts to persuade the leadership of UNITA that it should heed the appeals of the international community will soon bear fruit.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">The scope of the measures that the Council should adopt if UNITA fails to accept in due time the proposals put forward by the mediation, reflects not only the seriousness of the situation, but also the determination of the Council as regards the prompt and successful conclusion of the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">We fully concur with the views expressed by the Secretary-General that the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) remains an important element in the efforts towards a political solution in Angola. In this connection, we welcome the preparations and the contingency planning undertaken by the Secretary-General for an appropriate United Nations presence in Angola once a comprehensive peace settlement is reached. My Government wishes to put on record once again its firm commitment to continue to contribute to the advancement of peace in Angola, in particular in the crucial post-Lusaka period.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vorontsov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">During the month that has passed since the adoption of the last resolution on Angola, there has been some movement - and this is to a large extent thanks to the flexible position taken by the Government of Angola - in the Lusaka talks. This shows that there is a real possibility of a comprehensive peace agreement's being signed in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The main obstacle to the successful conclusion of those negotiations at present is the attempt by UNITA to continue haggling over a package of proposals by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the three observer countries. By systematically escalating its demands and disregarding the decisions of the Security Council and the recommendations of the mediator and the three observer States, UNITA is forcing us to consider very seriously the question of introducing additional sanctions, as provided for in paragraph 26 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Meanwhile, we must all take into account that the Angolan Government, which has officially accepted the proposal of the mediator, was counting on the fact that everything possible would be done to ensure a compromise by the Savimbi side as well. Against that background, any demonstration by the Security Council of hesitancy or lack of resolution in the application of additional sanctions against UNITA could be construed as being rather soft on the obstructionist leadership of UNITA.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">The Russian delegation is willing to support the draft resolution on Angola. We feel that it successfully combines firmness and flexibility, both essential at this critical stage in the negotiating process. Here we proceed from the clear understanding achieved in the Council that if by the end of July UNITA has not formally accepted the complete set of proposals of the mediator, then the Security Council will immediately, without procrastination, set in train the mechanism of additional sanctions.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Guided by the desire to ensure the swift restoration of peace and a halt to this fratricidal war in Angola, we urgently call on the leadership of UNITA to move towards a stance of political realism and immediately do its part in working towards a successful conclusion of the negotiating process.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">We also regard as particularly important the provisions in the draft resolution for strict respect by all, particularly neighbouring States, of the embargo on the delivery of arms to UNITA, and for enhancing the effectiveness of the current sanctions regime.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">We are deeply concerned at the continuing escalation of military actions in Angola and the attempts by both sides to strengthen their negotiating positions through violence. All of this seriously complicates the attainment of agreement in Lusaka. It leads to further casualties and suffering among the people of Angola, and worsens the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in the country. We would once again appeal to the Angolan parties immediately to halt all military action and to guarantee safety for the delivery of humanitarian relief to all parts of the country and ensure that without hindrance it can be distributed among the people of Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">We firmly believe that Angola will have no future without peace. Accordingly, Russia, acting along with other observer States at the Lusaka negotiations and with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, will continue to do everything it can to ensure a successful outcome of the negotiating process and a settlement of the Angola conflict on the basis of the Bicesse Accords and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gambari</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Once again the Security Council is confronted with the tragic situation in Angola. On the one hand, the political situation in Angola since the last review by the Security Council shows that commendable progress has been made on the outstanding, specific principles between the Government and UNITA at the Lusaka talks. In fact, of the six issues that were outstanding in May, only one issue now remains unresolved - an issue linked to State administration.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">On the other hand, however, regrettably, the same progress cannot be observed on the military front, as fighting has lately intensified in several parts of the country, causing further loss of life and further damage to basic infrastructures. Similarly, on the humanitarian plane, the intensification of war throughout Angola since the end of May has virtually brought the delivery of relief supplies by air to a complete standstill and by road to a much reduced level, and it has jeopardized the progress made in the last nine months in attempting to stabilize the conditions of the vulnerable segment of the population in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">My delegation salutes the courage and good judgement shown by the Government of Angola in formally accepting the proposals of national reconciliation made by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the three observer States. None the less, we cannot hide our disappointment that UNITA, by its failure to accept those proposals, has not demonstrated equal flexibility and magnanimity in the interests of peace for all the people of Angola. In this connection, we call on UNITA to accept the proposals without further procrastination, as called for in the draft resolution that we are about to adopt, because it cannot be expected that the international community should wait much longer before doing what it has to do to ensure that the ongoing Lusaka talks are brought to a speedy conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">It is absolutely right that in the present draft resolution the Council should now declare its readiness and its intent to impose additional measures against UNITA, as indicated in paragraph 26 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a> if by 31 July 1994 UNITA has not formally accepted the complete set of proposals on national reconciliation. My delegation is of the view that this is a very generous time-frame for UNITA to respond to the carefully worked out set of proposals, proposals that were made in good faith. We hope that UNITA will respond, that it will respond positively, and that it will respond soon.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">We are also concerned at the deteriorating humanitarian situation now prevailing in Angola, a situation that is addressed in the draft resolution before us. Quite rightly, the draft resolution calls on the parties to cease all offensive military actions throughout Angola, which lie at the root of the grave humanitarian situation. In this connection, we call on all parties, in particular UNITA, to allow the unrestricted movement of humanitarian relief and humanitarian relief workers throughout Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">By extending the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) for another three months, the international community has demonstrated its abiding commitment to the quest for peace in Angola. We commend the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, as well as the Force Commander, for their untiring efforts and dedication to the peaceful resolution of the Angolan conflict. We commend also the important role being played by the three observer States - the troika - and by States and United Nations agencies as well as non-governmental organizations in the supply of humanitarian relief materials to the needy in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, Angola is a country with which Nigeria enjoys close fraternal ties. Therefore, my delegation sincerely hopes that peace will soon return to Angola so that its Government and people may soon be able to commence a programme of reconstruction, a programme of rehabilitation and a programme of sustainable development. It is only then that the struggle of all the people of Angola will be crowned with certain victory. In the sincere hope, therefore, that our collective action in this Council will help advance the process of peace and the prospects of social and economic reconstruction in Angola, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements following the voting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mérimée</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa01">For almost two years now a civil war has been pounding Angola mercilessly, and the Lusaka talks that we had welcomed are not yielding any conclusion, while the suffering of the people increases.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa02">On several occasions the Security Council has given more time to the parties to conclude the negotiations. But we have to recognize that new pretexts and new demands are constantly being put forward in order to delay the conclusion of a comprehensive peace agreement. It was therefore necessary for the Council to show in this resolution that its patience was running out and to say very clearly to the parties, particularly UNITA, that they must stop delaying tactics and respond positively to the equitable compromise proposals made by the mediators in the process. France therefore calls on UNITA to accept the proposals in their entirety, or new sanctions will be adopted against it. The goal of the Security Council is not to punish but, to the contrary, to contribute to the restoration of peace and democracy in Angola. It is in this spirit that the Council has reaffirmed its willingness substantially to increase the strength of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) once a peace agreement has been concluded.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa03">My delegation once again pays a tribute to the efforts that have been made for several months now by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Blondin Beye, and by the three observer States to ensure that progress is made in the peace process. We also welcome the action taken by President Mandela and express the hope that it will soon be successful.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa04">While the negotiations drag on, France is particularly concerned over the intensification in the military offensives and their consequences for the delivery of humanitarian assistance, which is still being blocked. My country strongly urges the parties to cooperate with UNAVEM II to ensure the distribution of relief supplies throughout the country.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa01">The Chinese delegation welcomes the participation of the representative of Angola and also welcomes the statement he has made in the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa02">The resolution just adopted by the Council has once again extended the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II). This shows the determination of and the commitment undertaken by the international community in favour of an early and peaceful solution to the question of Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa03">The Chinese delegation has all along supported the peace process in Angola, and appreciates the unswerving efforts made by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and African countries, as well as other interested countries. We support the continued presence and role of UNAVEM II in Angola. In view of the foregoing, the Chinese delegation voted in favour of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa04">The peace process in Angola is now at a crucial moment. Thanks to the efforts of the parties concerned, some encouraging results have been achieved at the Lusaka peace talks, which have been going on for over seven months. However, because of the differences between the two Angolan parties on some specific principles concerning national reconciliation, the peace process is constantly being obstructed. The Chinese delegation is of the view that as long as the two Angolan parties show sincerity and political will, and put state and national interests first, the existing differences can be removed through negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa05">Social stability and national unity are most precious for a developing country. In order to ensure the success of the peace process in Angola, we urge the two Angolan parties, especially UNITA, to comply faithfully with the relevant Security Council resolutions, cease forthwith all hostile actions, achieve an effective and lasting cease-fire, diligently fulfil the commitments they made during the Lusaka talks, cooperate with UNAVEM II, and comprehensively implement the <i>Acordos de Paz </i>so as to bring the peace process in Angola to an early conclusion and achieve national reconciliation and peace and stability throughout the country.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">A month has passed since our last discussion of this item, and the Security Council is once again dealing with the situation in Angola. My delegation would have wished that by today the pending issues in the talks in Lusaka between the Government of Angola and UNITA would be solved and, more concretely, we had hoped that UNITA would have accepted all the specific proposals on national reconciliation presented by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Blondin Beye, with the support of the three observer States. These proposals have already been accepted by the Angolan Government. If they had been accepted by both sides, that would have marked the beginning of a new, hopeful and crucial stage in the Angolan peace process. Unfortunately, as the Secretary-General notes in his report, this has not happened.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">The resolution the Security Council has just adopted extends the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) for an additional three months. This decision once again reflects the international community's firm commitment to the Angolan people. At the same time, we must emphasize the importance of operative paragraph 5 of today's resolution, in which the Security Council declares its readiness to impose additional measures against UNITA as indicated in paragraph 26 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a> if by 31 July 1994 UNITA has not formally accepted the complete set of proposals on national reconciliation, to which I have already referred. The Council must be ready at that time to impose these measures, which in general mean trade sanctions and restrictions on travel by UNITA personnel. Such measures will have to be set forth specifically in a subsequent decision of the Security Council if UNITA has not by 31 July 1994 demonstrated its genuine determination to achieve a lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Spain is confident that at the end of this further period it will not be necessary to impose these additional sanctions on UNITA, and that the Security Council will be able by then to record an agreement between the parties on a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Such an agreement would make it possible to reinforce the United Nations presence in Angola with a view to monitoring the cease-fire and compliance with the <i>Acordos de Paz</i>. This will obviously depend on the attitude and willingness of the Angolan parties, in particular UNITA.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Spain is seriously concerned at the military operations throughout the country, which are constantly increasing and having a deplorable effect on the humanitarian situation, to the detriment of the civilian population, which is enduring unspeakable suffering because of the prolongation and intensification of the conflict. This is an additional reason - perhaps the most powerful one - for redoubling the efforts to achieve a final peace in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">We regard as particularly disquieting the facts described in the most recent report by the Secretary-General on a series of incidents that have occurred since the middle of May as a result of, among other things, UNITA's refusal to allow humanitarian relief flights to various parts of the country or to allow international officials to leave Huambo. We condemn these actions, which endanger the humanitarian relief efforts, and all other actions that can hinder the free and unrestricted movement of this humanitarian assistance and those who provide it.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We wish to thank the Secretary-General for drawing the international community's attention to these actions and for the efforts exerted by the Department of Peace-keeping Operations, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Blondin Beye, in putting an end to the obstruction of humanitarian assistance. Specifically, we extol the diligence and effectiveness displayed in achieving the evacuation from Malange, on 23 June, of several people, including a Spanish nun who needed urgent medical treatment.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">All of us should be well aware that the countdown to the conclusion of the Lusaka peace talks and to the solution of the pending questions related to national reconciliation in Angola begins today.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Albright</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">Just one month ago, when the last resolution on Angola was adopted by the Security Council, we noted our deep concern over the increase in fighting and the resulting threat to the people of Angola. Since then, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated dramatically. Relief efforts have largely been halted by the intensification of fighting, and starvation is a very real threat for millions of Angolans.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">The resolution poses two choices for Angola's leaders. First, hostilities must cease throughout Angola to allow relief operations to resume and to create the proper atmosphere for the successful conclusion of the Lusaka talks. Secondly, UNITA should accept the mediation proposals on national reconciliation. The mediation proposals, already accepted by the Government of Angola, meet the legitimate concerns of both sides. While the proposals do not include all the symbols desired by each side, we expect Angola's leaders to discern the difference between substance and symbol.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">The Lusaka peace process has brought both sides close to the comprehensive accord that would at last bring peace to Angola. The United States has given complete support to the Lusaka peace process, and to the proposals presented by the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr. Beye, to both sides. Ambassador Paul Hare, President Clinton's Special Envoy, continues his efforts, along with his troika partners, to bring the Lusaka peace process to a successful conclusion. The United States reiterates its strong commitment to helping Angola to implement a comprehensive peace accord. We look to Angola's leaders to take the final steps for peace.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir David Hannay</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">The resolution which we have just adopted reflects the unanimous view of the Council that the talks in Lusaka have already dragged on too long and should now be brought to a speedy conclusion. In my statement to the Security Council one month ago on the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-922(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 922 (1994)</a>, I welcomed the Government of Angola's acceptance of the compromise proposals on national reconciliation put forward by the Special Representative and the three observer States, and I called upon UNITA quickly to accept, without reservation, that proposal. I reminded UNITA of the Council's readiness to impose further measures if it did not. Unfortunately, UNITA has so far failed to heed that warning, and the Council has accordingly declared its readiness to impose additional measures against UNITA if it does not accept the proposal by the end of July. I strongly urge UNITA now to do so.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Meanwhile, the military situation in Angola continues to deteriorate, despite the demands addressed in both this resolution and in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-903(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 903 (1994)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-922(1994).pdf" class="pdf">922 (1994)</a> to the parties to cease all offensive military actions. We deplore this increase in military activity, of which both parties are guilty and which serves only to prolong the suffering of the people of Angola. The fighting must cease. It is unacceptable, and totally counterproductive, for the parties to pursue military offensives while simultaneously negotiating in Lusaka.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">My Government is deeply concerned at the steady deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Angola. As the Secretary-General's report on this situation makes clear, the intensification of the war throughout the country since the end of last month has reduced the delivery of relief supplies and affected the safety of relief workers. Both sides, but most particularly UNITA, must give guarantees of safety and freedom of movement for relief workers, supplies and aircraft. The international community is trying to help the civilian victims of the war in Angola through the provision of humanitarian assistance. Those who block such assistance for their own ends and who continue to prosecute the war deserve our condemnation.</p>
