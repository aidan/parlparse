	Mr. Hapsoro (Indonesia)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa01">My delegation is particularly pleased that the draft resolutions contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-626-Add.1.pdf">A/52/626/Add.1</a>, on "Macroeconomic policy questions", which we have just adopted, represent a further step by the General Assembly towards the implementation of agreements reached.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa02">With reference to draft resolution II, adopted as <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-180.pdf">resolution 52/180</a>, however, my delegation would like to underline that all countries can become vulnerable in the course of the liberalization of their external economic and financial regimes, regardless of their stage of development and whether or not they are developed or developing countries. The globalization of financial markets can create new risks of instability, with the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and adversely affect the international financial system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa03">We have witnessed that the capacity to fine-tune volatility in the short term through macroeconomic management has little impact in itself. As the movement of large volumes of funds between markets across national borders can take place rapidly, we sincerely believe that government policy has a critical role to play and represents a potent means for avoiding extremes in business cycles.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa04">During the past six months, sharp fluctuations in international finance and stock markets have negatively affected the world, and particularly the development process of the developing countries. We have noted that the Bretton Woods institutions have taken the necessary steps to overcome the crisis, but it seems that these steps have had little positive effect. We are very pleased that the General Assembly has already voiced its concerns this year. It is imperative to strengthen multilateral cooperation to offset or prevent any future negative impact on development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa05">Less than a week ago, the World Trade Organization reached agreement on and adopted a finance pact with far-reaching impact. The negotiations, involving 102 countries, sealed a global financial-services pact that will liberalize trillions of dollars' worth of trade in the banking, insurance and brokerage sectors. In this regard, we are fortunate that <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-180.pdf">resolution 52/180</a> mentions that the promotion of capital account liberalization should be done only in an orderly and flexible manner, so as to enable individual Member countries to tailor their capital account liberalization to the circumstances pertaining to each of their countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa06">These resolutions are without doubt an example of constructive negotiation and cooperation on the part of all groups and delegations. Although the process was arduous and difficult, all sides ultimately exercised flexibility and displayed a willingness to negotiate and make the necessary compromises in order to reach consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa07">As coordinator for this item within the Group of 77, my delegation would like to express its appreciation to the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Second Committee, who facilitated the process leading up to adoption of the resolutions. In addition, we would like to express our sincere thanks to the entire membership of the Group of 77 and China for their support and encouragement during the deliberations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk07-pa01">In explaining its position on draft resolution I in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-626-Add.1.pdf">A/52/626/Add.1</a>, entitled "Global partnership for development: high-level international intergovernmental consideration on financing for development", just adopted by consensus as <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-179.pdf">resolution 52/179</a>, the Philippine delegation wishes to emphasize the following points. First, it is the understanding of my delegation that the Bureau of the Second Committee will immediately undertake informal consultations with Member States and the Secretariat on the most appropriate dates for a two-day resumed session of the Second Committee during the fifty-second session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk07-pa02">Secondly, my delegation would prefer that the resumed session of the Second Committee be convened as soon as possible. And, thirdly, the success of the work of the ad hoc open-ended working group, which will be convened during the fifty-third session of the General Assembly, will depend to a large extent on the required inputs that will be determined during the two-day resumed session and on the index report of the current themes that the Secretary-General will identify after a careful and thorough examination of all the reports requested. Needless to say, my delegation attaches great importance to the index report referred to in paragraph 5 of the resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk07-pa03">Allow me also to take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Oscar de Rojas of Venezuela for a splendid performance as Chairman of the Second Committee and to express our abiding gratitude for his stewardship of the Committee. We have given him more work in the resolution we have just adopted, but we are confident that he will lead us to a fruitful outcome of the resumed session of the Second Committee.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa02">We are deeply convinced that economic development, social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development, which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people.

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I would like, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, to express our appreciation to Ambassador Oscar de Rojas, Chairman of the Second Committee, and his Bureau for the way they have been guiding the work of the Committee for the last eight weeks, and in particular with respect to the resolution of the matter on which we have just taken action. I wish also to thank you, Mr. President, for the way in which you have guided the work of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa02">I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Ambassador Betty King, the new representative of the United States to the Economic and Social Council, and to assure her of our cooperation in furthering the work of that Council -- and in particular of the Second Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa03">As members may recall the Second Committee failed to conclude its work on Friday, 5 December 1997, owing to lack of agreement between the United States delegation and the Group of 77 and China on six draft resolutions which contained references to the concept of sustained economic growth and sustainable development. This was regrettable to all of us, and forced the Committee to take decisions by votes. However, we are glad that through the diplomatic skills of Mr. Nikolai V. Tchoulkov, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, we were able to resolve the impasse, which led to the consensus adoption of the six-plus-one resolutions as well as the resolution on desertification. In this context, I would like, on behalf of the Group, to thank Mr. Tchoulkov for his efforts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa04">In spite of the adoption of the six resolutions by consensus, the Group of 77 and China strongly maintain that for any development process to be meaningful, particularly in developing countries, economic growth which is sustained over a period of time is crucial and critical. This requires the support of developed countries in terms of increased additional resources and transfer of appropriate technology. Moreover, it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries. In our view, sustainable development objectives are attainable only if economic growth is sustained in the medium and long term.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa05">To most developing countries, the sustainable development approach, as emphasized by most of our developed partners, is considered restrictive, limiting economic growth to social development and protection of the environment.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa06">It is in this context that the Group of 77 and China had a lot of difficulties in accepting the languages proposed by the United States delegation. However, in the spirit of compromise, and following the tradition in our Committee, the Group of 77 and China have accepted the compromise package, as proposed by the facilitator, so that all the resolutions in stalemate could be adopted by consensus. In this connection, the Group of 77 and China would like strongly to reiterate their acceptance of the package at this juncture, which would in no way prejudice future use of the concept in our work.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa02">We wish to place on record our conviction that the replacement, in the six resolutions adopted in the Second Committee, of the concept of sustained economic growth and sustainable development with a phrase from the medium-term plan for sustained economic growth and sustainable development -- "in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences" -- limits that concept. This has been a long-standing position of principle taken by the developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The wording that appears in the medium-term plan was the outcome of difficult negotiations in the Fifth Committee and imposes an interpretation at variance with the concept of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the context of the aforementioned resolutions.

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa01">My delegation would like to express its felicitations to all member countries that actively participated in formulating the resolution on renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation, as contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-628-Add.1.pdf">A/52/628/Add.1</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa02">This resolution not only establishes an important landmark, as we have been advocating for more than three years now, but also demonstrates the determination of the international community to recognize that in promoting development in the vastly changed process of globalization and rapidly growing interdependence, there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits, shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa03">We believe that the much larger spirit of partnership which has been manifested in numerous intergovernmental forums over the past three years will be further strengthened and more broadly embraced when such a dialogue is held in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa04">Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization -- notably, the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration, growing interdependence, the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity, the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa05">It is now widely recognized that the trends towards regional integration, interdependence and globalization, while positive in themselves, could also at the same time pose challenges which could have negative effects on developing countries. It is therefore timely and appropriate to launch a continued process of dialogue among all the actors concerned.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa06">In the international economic sphere, for example, regional integration needs to be built upon the spirit of mutual interdependence and transparency to prevent any attempt at establishing inward-looking arrangements, leading to closed trading blocs that could be misused as tools for protectionism. Similarly, the growing interdependence among nations exemplified by the increasing reliance of developed countries on developing countries' markets for export growth suggests the need for dialogue to define the rules of the game on a more participatory and democratic basis.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa07">We consider the first dialogue at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly to be a critical and necessary step to ensure that the process of fulfilling the commitments to cooperation for development moves forward steadily. In this respect, we believe that preparations for the dialogue should be undertaken well in advance by the President of the General Assembly in order to lead the first of a series of dialogues to a successful conclusion.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa08">Considering that process essential, my delegation will stand ready to actively participate and will look forward to having a fruitful discussion in the dialogue.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk10-pa01">My delegation wishes to express its satisfaction at the adoption of the resolution on international cooperation to reduce the impact of the El Niño phenomenon, which chiefly affects the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean, since the resolution reflects the international community's commitment to act concertedly and pragmatically to prevent, mitigate and redress the devastating effects of this natural phenomenon.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk10-pa02">The adoption of this resolution, in the framework of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, is a timely contribution on the part of the United Nations that will make it possible to reinforce the coordinated efforts of States and of the bodies and organizations of the United Nations system to put together a concerted international strategy to tackle the negative effects of this natural phenomenon. In particular, my delegation wishes to highlight the establishment of the Inter-agency Task Force, whose work will be especially important in discharging the mandates that we have established by adopting this resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk10-pa03">At the same time, I wish to thank all delegations for their valuable cooperation throughout our negotiations leading to agreement on the text of this resolution. Those negotiations took place in a climate of partnership and mutual understanding.

	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk10-pa04">Lastly, allow me to pay particular tribute to the United Nations Development Programme, which has provided Ecuador with important assistance in redressing the effects of El Niño, which in recent days has been causing serious damage in broad areas of Ecuadorian territory.</div>

The draft is not new to the members of this Assembly, particularly those who took part in the debates in the Second Committee, because the text before the Assembly, which my country has the honour to sponsor, is in fact a consensus text that was discussed and negotiated at length in the Second Committee under the guidance of Vice-Chairman Adel Abdellatif. Mr. Abdellatif presented this same text to the Committee for consideration on the last day of our work, but at that time the Committee decided not to take action on it. That is why today I have the honour to introduce the same text to the plenary of the General Assembly for consideration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk09-pa02">I should like once again to express, through you, Mr. President, my thanks for the excellent work done by Mr. Abdellatif in arriving at this consensus text. As this will be the last statement that I will be making in plenary, I should also like to thank the other Vice-Chairman, Mr. Glanzer, for the work that he, too, accomplished in the negotiations on many of the draft resolutions that we have adopted this afternoon. I should also like to thank the Rapporteur, Mr. Chung, and all the facilitators who worked so hard during discussions and negotiations on the various resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk09-pa03">I should also like in particular to thank the delegation of the Russian Federation, which provided decisive help in reaching the agreements that we have confirmed here this afternoon. I should like to thank you, Mr. President, for your own mediation on our behalf in recent days, in particular yesterday. This encouraged us and enabled us to get where we are today. Finally, I should like to thank all the delegations that worked so hard in a spirit of great cooperation, enabling us to achieve these results.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk03-pa01">I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia -- and the associated country Cyprus, as well as the European Free Trade Association country, member of the European Economic Area, Iceland, align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk03-pa02">The General Assembly has just adopted the final report of the Second Committee. We wish to take this opportunity to make an evaluation, at the level of the General Assembly, of the proceedings of the Second Committee, since the European Union did not speak at the close of those proceedings.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk03-pa03">The European Union is of the opinion that we can only address macroeconomic and development questions effectively through consensus. We are pleased that a compromise was finally found to allow us to adopt almost all reports by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk03-pa04">We would, however, like to flag our concerns with regard to the latest developments within the Second Committee, which was obliged to vote on a certain number of resolutions other than those for which a vote is normally required. We consider that it should have been possible to reach compromises within the Committee. We are particularly grateful for the efforts of the Bureau of the Second Committee, as well as those of the delegation of the Russian Federation and the President of the General Assembly, to try to reach consensus on all points.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk03-pa05">Allow me also to make some brief remarks regarding the organization of the work of the Second Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk03-pa06">The European Union welcomes the organization by the Chairman of the Second Committee, in accordance with resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-227.pdf">A/50/227</a>, of the round tables and panel discussions in which first-rank guests took part, in particular those which brought together representatives from the Second and Third Committees. Holding such events as close as possible to the consideration of the relevant point should allow delegations to draw the greatest possible benefit. It would be worth reflecting on the best way of combining these round tables with the more traditional debates in our Committee. The European Union would like to stress the importance which it attaches to maintaining the vocation of the General Assembly as the principal forum for the discussion of major topical questions. In this respect, we reaffirm our support for the proposals of the Secretary-General aimed at strengthening the importance of the work of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk03-pa07">The European Union would like to insist on the need to maintain self-discipline in the work of the Second Committee in order to guarantee that it be finished within the necessary time limits. The work of the Second Committee cannot take place without a firmer approach with regard to the organization and management of the progress of our sessions. The experience of the past two years has in fact clearly shown in this regard how important it is that member States and the Bureau respect deadlines for the submission of draft resolutions. The European Union welcomes the chance that we have had to discuss with our partners the aims which we hope to achieve through various resolutions before entering into a paragraph-by-paragraph reading. We hope that a similar approach can be adopted systematically for an increasing number of resolutions in the coming years, including before the formal of submission of draft resolutions or even before the official start of the work of the Committees.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk03-pa08">The European Union considers it important not to lose sight of the substance and added value of the different resolutions submitted by the Second Committee, for on this hangs to a large extent the credibility of the United Nations in the economic, social and related areas. The possibilities offered by combining different resolutions and increasing the number of so-called omnibus resolutions should be further explored. We regret the recent tendency to introduce separate resolutions on subjects that require an integrated and overall approach. It is essential that delegations have sufficient time after the debates to consider the various draft resolutions adequately. In this context, we applaud the initiative taken by the Group of 77 to circulate, in advance, tables giving details of all forthcoming informal meetings. It is important that we continue to rationalize the work of the Second Committee, including through a regular examination of the periodicity of agenda points.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk03-pa09">In conclusion, the European Union would like to thank all delegations for their cooperation. Our thanks go also to all the members of the Bureau of the Second Committee, as well as to the facilitators and members of the Secretariat for their support.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk05-pa02">I think that the Committee at this session has made a very remarkable contribution to the process of consensus-making, which is a feature of this session of the General Assembly. Thanks to cooperation among many delegations -- the Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation was mentioned a few times -- the Group of 77 and the United States delegation, as well as to the entire membership, a consensus was reached on very important resolutions which the General Assembly has just adopted. This is a very important contribution to the overall activities of the General Assembly, especially on important issues pertaining to economic development.</div>
