	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The draft annual report of the Security Council for the period 16 June 1996 to 15 June 1997, to be submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations in pursuance of paragraph 3 of Article 24 and paragraph 1 of Article 15 of the United Nations Charter, has been prepared by the Secretariat in line with the revised format agreed upon by the Security Council in 1974 and further revised in 1985, 1993 and 1994 and 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The present format of the draft report before the Council provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a concise manner. As requested by the Security Council, it contains in its introduction more information about the work of each of the Sanctions Committees than has previously been done. It also lists the meetings of troop-contributing countries chaired by the President of the Security Council during the period under review.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The draft report was circulated by the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 27 August 1997 to the current members of the Security Council and also to the respective members whose terms of office expired on 31 December 1996 -- that is, Botswana, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia and Italy -- for review and comments, if any. Corrigenda containing changes proposed by Council members and by the Secretariat have also been circulated to Council members.</p>
