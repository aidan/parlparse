	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa01">The appointment of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello as High Commissioner for Human Rights augurs well for the continuation of the outstanding work of the United Nations in the promotion and protection of human rights. For Brazil, it is an honour and a source of great satisfaction that one of its nationals should be assigned such an important responsibility.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa02">Sergio Vieira de Mello needs no introduction. His important achievements in East Timor and at the helm of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are only the latest examples of a long career devoted to the realization of the values enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Mr. Vieira de Mello is rightly recognized as an efficient administrator, a skilful negotiator and a committed individual. He is also known for his high moral stature and for being identified with humanitarian causes. There is no doubt that he will put all those qualities at the service of the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa03">We wish Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello every success in his new position, and we assure him of Brazil's support and cooperation in the discharge of his important mandate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa04">My delegation would also like to express its deep appreciation for the invaluable work that Mrs. Mary Robinson has done as High Commissioner for Human Rights. During her five years in office, Mrs. Robinson contributed to heightening the level of attention paid to the plight of victims of abuses and human rights violations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa02">The European Union warmly welcomes the appointment of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello to succeed Mrs. Mary Robinson as High Commissioner for Human Rights.

During her five years in office impressive results have been obtained. The personal and professional integrity, combined with hard work, with which Mrs. Robinson has constantly fought for human rights all over the world is a model for all of us.

I wish to say that, for Mexico, the accreditation and participation of non-governmental organizations in the Ad Hoc Committee on a Comprehensive and Integral International Convention on Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities will without doubt be a great achievement of the Assembly. As we have stressed, the draft resolution now before the Assembly is very important because it confirms that non-governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council have a right to participate in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee. The draft resolution also facilitates participation by other organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk05-pa02">Also, the draft resolution urges relevant United Nations bodies to provide financial assistance to those organizations that lack the resources necessary to participate, in particular those from developing countries, on the basis of the establishment of criteria for transparency and equality in the allocation of such assistance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk05-pa03">As well, the Secretary-General is requested to disseminate to non-governmental organizations information on accreditation procedures. The Assembly would also decide that the specific modalities of this participation will be decided by the Ad Hoc Committee during the first week of its session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk05-pa04">Non-governmental organizations working in favour of rights and equal opportunities for persons with disabilities and organizations composed of persons with disabilities have played an essential role in promoting and creating awareness on this important issue. Through their local, national, regional and global networks, they have made very valuable contributions to the international community in many areas related to the defence and promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities. Their contribution is indispensable, because we want the convention to provide viable responses to meet the situation and the needs of persons with various kinds of disabilities, whose circumstances may vary from country to country or region to region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk05-pa05">For that reason, and because the convention should have a comprehensive and integral approach, and pursuant to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-168.pdf">General Assembly resolution 56/168</a>, the Ad Hoc Committee must have as many views of the issue as possible.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk05-pa06">Accordingly, my country would invite all General Assembly members to adopt the draft resolution before us. We believe that the process that will begin in a few days to prepare a convention will be further enriched. Above all, we will be able to include those actors who ultimately are the ones who will benefit most from what will, no doubt, be the successful outcome of the Ad Hoc Committee's work.</div>

By this draft decision, the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General to make reasonable efforts, within existing resources, to facilitate the full and equal participation in the deliberations of the Ad Hoc Committee by persons with disabilities and would suggest various ways by which people with disabilities might be accommodated during the sessions of the Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa02">The Ad Hoc Committee will be considering proposals for an international convention to protect and promote the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. It is important to recognize that talk of equal rights and opportunities for the disabled and their full participation in society is meaningless unless the international community is willing, at the same time, to adopt a flexible approach to its "normal" practices and to make the reasonable accommodations necessary to enable people with disabilities to actually play their part and make their contribution. Many people with disabilities either require very little, if anything, in the way of accommodation, or make whatever special arrangements they need themselves. However, some severely disabled persons may require special arrangements and, in their case, we should do our utmost to be as receptive and inclusive as possible so that they may be full and equal partners in our work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa03">Therefore, although this draft decision may at first glance seem procedural in nature, it is in a very real sense substantive and particularly germane to the work of the Ad Hoc Committee. It is our hope that whatever reasonable efforts are made to accommodate persons with disabilities in the meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee will soon be adopted routinely at all United Nations meetings.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The United States is grateful to Mexico and Canada for sponsoring this draft decision and for having immediately embraced its objectives and approach.

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa01">My delegation joined others in the informal consultations leading to the current formulation of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.82.pdf">A/56/L.82</a>. We were keen to attend as many meetings as possible since the process began, because we attach great importance to the issue of disability and the rights of people living with disabilities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa02">My delegation, as well as many others, presented many amendments to the draft resolution that is before us for consideration. Unfortunately, most of them were not reflected in the draft resolution. I would hesitate to say that they were ignored, but that is a fact. And I would like to register our strongest objection to the process that led to the formulation of this draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa03">We now have two options between which to choose: either to accept it as it is and have this repeated as a precedent in the future; or to put it to the vote. It would not be a very good omen to start the process by taking a vote. We are very committed to and supportive of this process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa04">Not everybody in this building who is trying to regulate non-governmental organization (NGO) participation is against NGO participation in the work of the United Nations. Not everybody who is proposing a framework or trying to make clear what NGOs are coming here to do is against NGOs. Even if some parties would like to label it that way, it is not our concern, because we know that we are not against NGO participation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk06-pa05">But we will not block consensus on the draft resolution. Those are the instructions that I have in the light of the friendly relations between my country and Mexico, a friendly country that has devoted a lot of time and energy to this process for the past year. To show appreciation for the Mexican efforts, we will join consensus on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.82.pdf">A/56/L.82</a>. However, we would like this statement to be recorded in the official records of the meeting. The process can now begin. We will see in the course of action who was really attached to the process and who was not, and who wanted to destroy it procedurally.</div>
