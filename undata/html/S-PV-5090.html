<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valle</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Brazil will participate in the consensus regarding the adoption of the draft resolution concerning the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Our vote reflects the view that the agreed text is yet another step within a broader political process, as it addresses interim measures that should be supplemented by further decisions in line with Haiti's needs in the months to come. We express appreciation to all delegations for their efforts to arrive at a consensual text, and we encourage them to continue working towards a long-term solution for Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">We believe that security remains key for the achievement of stability in the country. Nonetheless, a sustainable solution for Haiti's many difficulties clearly goes beyond the security dimension. Given the interconnection between security and other main aspects of the Haitian crisis, it seems essential, in our view, that progress with regard to the needs for political reconciliation, economic reconstruction efforts and social amelioration needs to occur in parallel with the efforts being made in the field of security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Brazil believes that, as we move forward, a mandate for MINUSTAH that is more specific and concrete than the one endorsed in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1542(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1542 (2004)</a> will be required to provide an adequate framework for dealing with the present threats in Haiti and to allow for the implementation of concrete measures so as to achieve a prompt improvement in the living conditions of the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">In the absence of a number of measures -- including those aimed at job creation -- growing difficulties will probably arise for the maintenance of public order in the country. More precise language could have been included, for example, in operative paragraph 2, concerning the political reconciliation process; in operative paragraph 4, regarding economic development measures; and in the corresponding second, third and fourth preambular paragraphs. With regard to the duration of MINUSTAH's mandate, as provided for in operative paragraph 1, we trust that the intention to renew the mandate for further periods will be confirmed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">With a view to creating stable conditions for meaningful, free elections at the end of 2005, we support the view that the Council should issue stronger messages concerning the international community's long-term commitment to Haiti. That could have been done through the adoption of a broader multidisciplinary mandate for MINUSTAH. As we see it, the international community and the financial institutions should make further efforts to assist in managing concrete development projects and help to remedy any gaps or shortfalls.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">Although some countries and institutions have already commenced initiatives in the financial field, the scale of those efforts should be rapidly increased. We believe that, from a security perspective, the conditions for stepping up those efforts are already present. Donors should therefore be encouraged to accelerate the rate of disbursement of the funds pledged at the Washington Donors Conference, consistent with the priorities identified by the Haitian Transitional Government's interim cooperation framework.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">It is well known that, for the first time, many Latin American countries have joined efforts in the context of the Security Council aimed at helping to reach a permanent solution to a conflict in the region. That is an initiative that should be encouraged. Presently, approximately 70 per cent of the troops on the ground are from those countries. I should add that Brazil also highly values the support being given to MINUSTAH by non-Latin American countries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">I wish to stress the efforts being made by the region with regard to the stabilization of Haiti. Those significant efforts should be reinforced by a stronger commitment by the international community to the resolution of essential issues in Haiti that go beyond security.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">There were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1576(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1576 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">I shall now give the floor to those members of the Council who wish to make statements following the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">Chile, in accordance with its commitment to regional peace and security, promptly joined the provisional multinational force, helping to prevent a civil war and a humanitarian tragedy in Haiti. Aware that our support for Haiti should not be limited to the current emergency situation, we also joined the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). In doing so, we were convinced that only a comprehensive, multidimensional and long-term mission would be successful in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">Today, we would like to reaffirm that conviction. Therefore, we resolutely support the Secretary-General's proposal to extend the Mission's mandate for an 18-month period, which is consistent with our vision that the political, economic and social reconstruction of Haiti requires a long-term effort -- specifically, at least until the conclusion of the electoral process that will produce legitimate authorities for the people.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">Hence, we regret the fact that, ultimately, the resolution we have adopted contemplates a renewal of only six months. We believe that that could weaken the Mission's capacity to plan and carry out long-term activities. That could cause some countries to reassess their participation in MINUSTAH at the end of that period.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa04">Despite what I have said, we voted in favour of the resolution. We did that because, in the resolution, priority is placed on aspects that we consider central to Haiti's security and stability: for example, the strengthening of institutional capacities, respect for human rights, a necessary end to impunity and effective national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa05">Finally, we particularly value the fact that this resolution highlights the need for an inclusive political dialogue with the participation of all the political and social forces of Haiti that have opted for the democratic process, as well as the urgency of releasing the funds committed by donor countries and international financial institutions to facilitate the development projects that this brotherly country needs so urgently.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa01">Spain voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1576(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1576 (2004)</a> to extend the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). However, I should like to make a few observations, because we believe that the decision that we have just taken should not be considered as merely procedural. We believe that the United Nations operation in Haiti has a particular importance, precisely because of the previous setbacks that the international community has experienced in that country. Because of those setbacks, we must now think in terms of a comprehensive and long-term operation, so that we are sure we will attain the objective we have set of restoring to the Haitian people the possibility of governing themselves in conditions of freedom, democracy and better economic and social conditions in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa02">The problems that the international community faces in Haiti are so serious that it is not enough to resolve the immediate security crisis in the country or to take short-term measures. We must insist on a comprehensive approach that addresses the political and security situation, human rights and economic development as elements of a whole. Moreover, even though the prospect of free elections constitutes a notable achievement, it is crucial to begin an inclusive process of national dialogue that will enable all social and political sectors to participate. The history of Haiti has taught us that there is little use in palliative measures. We must learn from past mistakes and take a long-term approach to defining the action to be taken by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa03">For all those reasons, we are pleased that the resolution we have just adopted contains sufficient political, economic and social elements to help in promoting all those endeavours. At the same time, we must regret that the Council has been unable to support the recommendation of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative that MINUSTAH's mandate be extended for a longer period than usual -- for 18 months -- precisely so that it would be possible to plan in the long term. Nonetheless, we joined the consensus, because <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1576(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1576 (2004)</a>, which we have just adopted, extends the mandate of MINUSTAH for six months but makes it clear that the Security Council has the intention to renew for further periods. We hope that such renewals will take place, because that will enable the international community fully to meet its commitment to the Haitian people.</p>
