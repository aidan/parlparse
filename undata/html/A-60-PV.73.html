	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">I invite members to turn their attention to the note by the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/A-60-718.pdf" class="pdf">document A/60/718</a>. In his note the Secretary-General recalls that on 23 November 2005, the General Assembly approved a two-month extension of Mr. Töpfer's appointment, until the end of March 2006. In the same note, the Secretary-General informs the Assembly that, following a thorough review and evaluation of candidates proposed to succeed Mr. Töpfer, he wishes to nominate Mr. Achim Steiner for election as Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for a term of four years, beginning on 15 June 2006 and ending on 14 June 2010.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">Accordingly, may I take it that the General Assembly wishes to elect Mr. Achim Steiner as the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme for a term of four years, beginning on 15 June 2006 and ending on 14 June 2010?</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">We would like also to thank the Secretariat for having informed the regional groups about Mr. Steiner's nomination, though the Group of 77 and China would have preferred to have the regional groups consulted prior to this nomination. Our concern is being raised only in terms of the process and should not reflect on the person of Mr. Steiner. We are quite positive that he will carry out his work, prioritizing the needs of the developing world.</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa02">We would also like to thank Mr. Klaus Töpfer on a job well done. He did us proud during his stewardship of UNEP. One of the fond memories of the people of Kenya is that he not only served the United Nations, but became a real friend of the people of Kenya. We would like to thank him and to wish him well in his new work.</p>
