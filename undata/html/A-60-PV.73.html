In his note the Secretary-General recalls that on 23 November 2005, the General Assembly approved a two-month extension of Mr. Töpfer's appointment, until the end of March 2006. In the same note, the Secretary-General informs the Assembly that, following a thorough review and evaluation of candidates proposed to succeed Mr. Töpfer, he wishes to nominate Mr. Achim Steiner for election as Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for a term of four years, beginning on 15 June 2006 and ending on 14 June 2010.</div>
