	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 37 of its provisional rules of procedure to His Excellency Mr. Seydou Elimane Diarra, Prime Minister of the National Reconciliation Government of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Seydou Elimane Diarra, Prime Minister of the National Reconciliation Government of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I welcome the presence of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, at this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">As this is the last time that Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock will participate in the Council's deliberations in his current capacity as Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, I wish to take this opportunity to express to him, on behalf of the members of the Council, our appreciation of him as a colleague and friend. We shall remember him for his clarity and eloquence in his presentations and for his readiness to search for compromise. His unfailing eagerness to assist Council members in finding consensus language has often helped the Council to reach agreement on difficult issues. Aside from his ability to articulate and to persuade, he has also provided effective leadership to two Security Council missions to West Africa. Upon his departure from New York, Sir Jeremy will take up another delicate task as the United Kingdom's Special Representative in Iraq. I am sure that he will make use of his abundant professional expertise and his diplomatic skills to meet the challenges of that assignment. In bidding him a fond farewell, the other members of the Council and I wish him every success in his new endeavours.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">I give the floor to Ambassador Greenstock.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I thank you, Mr. President, for those words. I thank you for the expression in them of the Council's friendship with me over five years, and I thank all members for their part in that. You are all aware -- because you are around this table -- what a privilege it is to sit at it. The United Kingdom sits here more consistently than the majority, but it is our view that we have to earn that position of permanence on the Council. My delegation and I have tried to work with you to demonstrate that, in its search for results and improvements with regard to the world's peace and security, we are there to help you achieve those results, and I hope that I have played a small part in demonstrating that.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">We in the Council -- being only 15 among 191 -- have to remember that we represent the whole of the United Nations. The other organs of this great body expect that of us, and sometimes we respond to that. But I believe that we can work in this body with greater responsiveness and transparency to serve the interest of all Members. I hope that, there again, I have tried to show that that is an important feature of our work, because I believe that we are still underestimating the degree to which we can all serve our national interests, without exception, around this table, in the long term, by investing in the collective potential more consistently on specific issues. As I move into other business -- to which you, Mr. President, have referred -- I shall try to remember that the strength of this body lies in its collective input into the international effort to bring peace and security more consistently to the world.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I thank you all for your friendship and cooperation over the years, and will remain in touch with you.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a briefing by his excellency Mr. Seydou Elimane Diarra, Prime Minister of the Government of National Reconciliation of Côte d'Ivoire, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diarra</span> <span class="nation">Cote d'Ivoire</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">I should like at the outset to convey greetings from the President of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, of the Government of National Reconciliation and of the people of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">I should like to thank you, Mr. President, for having organized this Security Council meeting on Côte d'Ivoire. I should also like to commend and congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Lavrov, for the work carried out during the Russian presidency of the Security Council in the month of June, in particular the Council's visit to Côte d'Ivoire during its mission to West Africa, which was led by Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock. The report (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-688.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/688</a>) on that subject and the conclusions and recommendations that it contains have been examined by the Ivorian authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">That visit and this meeting attest to the importance that the United Nations attaches to Côte d'Ivoire and its people at this difficult moment in their history. In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless support for the process of restoring peace in Côte d'Ivoire. I should also like to commend the commitment of his Special Representative, Mr. Albert Tevoedjre, Chairman of the Monitoring Committee for the Linas-Marcoussis-Kleber and Accra II Agreements, and the other members of the Committee, as well as France and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who are working to bring about a successful resolution of the Ivorian crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">The Council is well aware of all the details of the Ivorian crisis. Its most recent visit to Côte d'Ivoire provided an opportunity to consider once again how to resolve the crisis, and its report takes due account of this.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">I should like, at the outset, to focus on what has been achieved since the signing of the Linas-Marcoussis-Kleber and Accra II Agreements, particularly since the formation of the Government of National Reconciliation. My Special Adviser for the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Programme will then provide a briefing on that issue prepared by Côte d'Ivoire. Lastly, I will be available to Council members to answer any specific questions that they may wish to ask me.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">What progress has been made in the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement since it was signed? On 13 March, the Government of National Reconciliation was instituted. This comprises all the signatories of the Linas-Marcoussis-Kleber and Accra II Agreements. All the ministers have been appointed and are working. On 3 May the integral ceasefire agreement between the National Armed Forces of Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles was signed. On 24 May, the extension of the ceasefire westward to the border with Liberia was implemented. On 1 June, a buffer zone between the National Armed Forces of Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles was defined. On 8 June the cantonment areas -- eight for the National Armed Forces of Côte d'Ivoire and nine for the Forces nouvelles -- were designated.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">Relations with neighbouring countries have been normalized. I should like to note in particular the visits of the Ministers for Trade and for Transport to Burkina Faso and Mali and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso and the President of the Republic of Mali to Côte d'Ivoire. Safe transportation corridors between Côte d'Ivoire and neighbouring countries have been opened. Those are some of the main achievements since the Government was established.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">I should also like to point out that, from 30 June to 2 July 2003, Council members gave new impetus to the Linas-Marcoussis-Kleber and Accra II Agreements, and further progress has been made. A joint statement that war had ended was issued on 4 July by the Armed Forces of Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles and, subsequently, the Council of Ministers adopted an amnesty bill. That bill has been submitted to the National Assembly and will be considered on 4 August at an extraordinary meeting and on 6 August in plenary meeting. The authority of the State has also been strengthened, in particular by restoring and maintaining order following the incidents that took place at the television centre on 27 June. Security has also been strengthened for all ministers and political figures through the establishment of an integrated operations centre, including the National Armed Forces, the Forces nouvelles, Operation Licorne and the ECOWAS forces.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa09">Prior to my departure for New York, I was in contact with the President of the Republic and the political forces with a view to holding discussions to appoint ministers for defence and internal security. By agreement with the President of the Republic and various political forces, I will, upon my return to Abidjan, undertake initiatives to address this issue so that the Government can be complete. To date, I can say that the Government is working normally and that the functions of the ministers for defence and security are being carried out.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa10">Within the framework of resuming economic and social activities, last week I travelled to Belgium, where I met bilaterally with the Belgian authorities and, on a multilateral basis, with officials from the European Commission, in particular President Romano Prodi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa11">Upon my return from New York, I will devote the month of August to visiting the various regions of Côte d'Ivoire in order to reassure the people about developments in the process of the return to peace.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa12">All of these activities will lead, in September, to the relaunching of the economy and, in particular, to contacts with the Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa13">What kind of support are we expecting from the Security Council with a view to giving new momentum to the process for the restoration of peace? Nationally, we will undertake what I would call the extension of phase-3 security throughout Côte d'Ivoire. This will be followed by the transition from phase 3 to phase 2.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa14">There will be a need to finance the ECOWAS Mission in Côte d'Ivoire; the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme and the redeployment of administration throughout the national territory. Financing will also be needed in the areas of health and education, particularly as the 2003-2004 school year begins.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa15">My Government will also be making a request for support from the United Nations for the holding of fair, transparent and open elections.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa16">There will, additionally, also be a need to re-launch the economy and increase humanitarian assistance, as well as to provide assistance in the training of young people and in the creation of jobs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa17">At the subregional level, there will be a need to settle the Liberian conflict, which will bring about stability throughout the entire subregion. Lastly, there will have to be a robust campaign against poverty in the subregion, which is the source of instability throughout Africa. In that connection, I believe we must focus on reducing poverty in order that we can provide stability in both Côte d'Ivoire and the whole subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa18">With the President's permission, I would ask my special adviser to introduce the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme that has been worked out by Côte d'Ivoire with the support of the World Bank, the European Union and United Nations Development Programme.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to Mr. Donwahi.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Donwahi</span> <span class="nation">Cote d'Ivoire</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">With the permission of the Security Council, I shall now present Côte d'Ivoire's national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme. It is important to note that the programme was prepared with the participation and consensus of the Forces nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire, the Forces armées nationals de Côte d'Ivoire (FANCI), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Mission in Côte d'Ivoire (ECOMICI) and the forces of Operation Licorne, as well as with the support of experts from the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and with the sanction of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The programme is based on measures put forth by the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. The measures consist of six elements, namely, amnesty, grouping, disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and restructuring. It is also important to note that these measures have made it possible to develop activities with the participation of all forces, which will facilitate the implementation of the programme.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">The national programme for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration is being pursued on three fronts, with the goal being peace and stability. That will be achieved through the establishment of a Government of national reconciliation and by reunifying the army by restructuring it to make it a force devoted to republican values. The national DDR programme is therefore the key to restructuring Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The DDR process in Côte d'Ivoire will take place during four phases: grouping, disarmament, demobilization, cantonment and reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Those measures have enabled us to prepare a timetable. The first element of that schedule involves preconditions, which will be addressed during a two-and-a-half-month period, that is, from the beginning of June to the middle of August. That will be followed by grouping, which will take place during a two-week period, from 13 August to early September. Disarmament will then start at the beginning of grouping and continue through the middle of September. That will be followed by demobilization, which will take place during a one-month period ending on 19 October. Cantonment will then take place during a two-week period, ending in the first week of November. Lastly, the most important component, which is reintegration, will take place during a period of 12 to 24 months.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">The forces involved have reached consensus to define 17 conditions, which we have summarized in the document we have circulated among the members of the Council. They include the five following points.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">First is the signing of a comprehensive ceasefire agreement, which took place on 3 May.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Secondly, there is the establishment of a buffer zone, which took place on 1 June. That zone, which can be seen on the map attached to the document we have circulated, runs east to west for about 40 kilometres. It includes the impartial forces of Operation Licorne and MINUCI. There are no weapons or, of course, belligerents, within the zone.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">Thirdly, there was also a joint communiqué declaring the end of the war, which was signed by the Forces armées nationales de Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire at a solemn ceremony at the presidential palace in the presence of the entire Government and the ambassadors accredited to Côte d'Ivoire. In addition, the ceremony was broadcast live on national television.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">Fourthly, an amnesty law that will enable us to begin the grouping programme will be presented to a parliamentary commission on 4 August, and to a plenary meeting of the National Assembly on 6 August.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">Fifthly, the restructuring of the Forces armées nationals de Côte d'Ivoire will be based on the law on military planning that has already been drafted and which will be strengthened in the light of the current situation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">Lastly, grouping will begin with the identification of cantonment areas, which started on 8 June. As members will see from the map before them, the cantonment areas in the south include Abidjan, Yamoussoukro, San Pédro, Daloa, Guiglo, Bondoukou, Daoukro and Duékoué. The cantonment areas in the north include Bouaké, Man, Séguéla, Odiéné, Korhogo, Ferkessédougou, Bouna, Ouangolodougou and Vavoua.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">Once the grouping begins on 20 August, the Forces armées nationales de Côte d'Ivoire will return to their barracks and the grouping of former combatants at the designated sites in the northern area will be carried out. Once the grouping has begun, we shall proceed to the identification and the verification of the identities of combatants. In that context, it should be noted that, thanks to support from the United Nations Development Programme, forms have been prepared to identify and assess the skills of ex-combatants. Those forms were designed on a consensual basis with the participation of all existing forces and have therefore been accepted by them all.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">After grouping, disarmament will begin. It has four principal elements. The first element is to sort arms and munitions, for weapons must be separated from munitions. The arms recovered will the be sorted according to whether or not they are listed by the national army of Côte d'Ivoire. We will then proceed to destroy weapons. A symbolic arms destruction ceremony will take place at the end of the disarmament cycle. Finally, new legislation will be adopted on arms possession in order to prepare the second part of the disarmament process: the disarmament of the civilian population.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa15">We need to combat the proliferation of small arms, and it is therefore important to disarm the civilian population. We will begin with an information and awareness campaign on the collection of weapons. That will be followed by voluntary arms collections, followed by incentives and, finally, coercion. At that time, we will need to renew or issue new weapons permits and punish violators.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa16">The third stage is demobilization and cantonment. We must identify the cantonment areas, which will be different from the grouping areas because in the cantonment areas former combatants will be assembled without their military equipment. Once the cantonment of former combatants has been completed, we will proceed to identify the candidates for demobilization, according to jointly agreed criteria and using the prepared forms. The status of the demobilized combatants will be decided by decree for non-commissioned officers and by legislative order for other combatants. Cantonment is the period before reintegration. It will enable us to compile the socio-economic data entered on the forms, to issue demobilization identity cards and to reorient those individuals towards civilian life, with all the necessary support.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa17">The final and most important stage of the programme is reintegration. As we have already stated, it will extend over a period of 12 to 24 months. To that end, we need to make preliminary studies to define reintegration activities. Those activities will be supported by vocational training, appropriate organizational structures and an appropriate civic service, since we now have a new ministry of youth and civic service, which will enable the annual graduation of 19,000 persons who can then be reintegrated into economic life. Special projects will be prepared for vulnerable groups such as child soldiers. We will also prepare education and follow-up relating to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa18">That is a summary of the programme of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I give the floor again to the Prime Minister of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diarra</span> <span class="nation">Cote d'Ivoire</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">I thank you, Sir, for your attention to this briefing. I will be available for any questions. I thank the Council for holding this meeting today.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">Today, we are in the process of emerging from the crisis. The guns have fallen silent. We are now attempting to get the Côte d'Ivoire to work, to resume our activities from the past, working with all neighbouring countries in the subregion. You have seen, Sir, that we have stressed social reintegration in our briefing. It is an important programme. In our country, if we do not get children back to work, we would be leaving them to destabilizing forces, to all those who would try to use them to destabilize the country. Our programme is doing everything possible so that by 2005, when our mission ends, we will have carried out the maximum number of reintegrations among the youth population, while stressing the campaign against HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">I wish to reaffirm that the goal of the Government of National Reconciliation is to bring about just, open and transparent elections in 2005.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De La Sablière</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa01">We are pleased to welcome among us Mr. Diarra, Prime Minister of Côte d'Ivoire. We thank him most warmly for his briefing, to which we listened with great interest. I am thoroughly convinced that Council members are well aware of the extent of his tasks and of the efforts he is making, which they appreciate.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa02">Unquestionably, as the Prime Minister has stressed, new progress towards reconciliation in Côte d'Ivoire has been registered since last May and the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1479(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1479 (2003)</a>. I think it is useful to recall the key elements of that progress.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa03">The first is the total ceasefire signed on 3 May by the Forces armées nationales de Côte d'Ivoire (FANCI) and the Forces nouvelles. The western part of the country has been pacified. Secondly, the cantonment sites for belligerents have been identified. It is important to recall that a declaration ending the war was adopted on 4 July. As was also indicated, a draft law on amnesty has been submitted by the Council of Ministers to the bureau of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister also noted that the normalization of relations between Côte d'Ivoire and its neighbours has begun. We also welcome the establishment of a climate of trust in Côte d'Ivoire, which is essential for the complete implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra Agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa04">However, as was also underlined, the process remains fragile. Much remains to be done for reconciliation in Côte d'Ivoire to be a complete success. I am thinking in particular of the cantonment of forces and of the disarmament of the Forces nouvelles, which should follow the vote on the amnesty law. I believe it was very useful to have, thanks to the Prime Minister and his delegation, a presentation of this programme, which enables us to see all the work planned and its importance for the success of the process.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa05">I should like also to welcome the involvement of President Kufuor and the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which are clear evidence of its political and operational capacity to help restore civil peace in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa06">While remaining very vigilant about the effective implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, the international community will continue to support the ECOWAS Mission in Côte d'Ivoire (ECOMICI). I believe that the donors conference held recently, on 18 July, in Paris gave some encouraging signs in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa07">Let me add that, on the ground, ECOWAS and French troops are continuing their efforts in support of the peace process. In keeping with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1464(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1464 (2003)</a>, France early next week will publish a report on the activities of Operation Licorne. The Council will also be renewing the six-month authorization it had granted to the peacekeeping forces. In that respect, my delegation will be submitting a brief technical draft resolution early next week.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa08">Finally, as Council members are aware, we have prepared a draft presidential statement embodying these main points. I understand that the expert-level meetings that took place this week indicate that there is agreement on the draft. If that is the case, it could perhaps be adopted at the end of this meeting, if members agree.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">It is a great pleasure to see Prime Minister Diarra among us. I should like to thank him for the hospitality which the Government of Côte d'Ivoire showed the Security Council mission during our visit there at the end of last month, for the trouble he is taking to follow up that mission and the resolutions of the Council on Côte d'Ivoire, and for his briefing this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">It is also a great pleasure to see Special Representative Tevoedjre with us this morning. It is very valuable to have him on the ground during this crucial period of the development of a new stability and reconciliation in Côte d'Ivoire. We need to continue to work closely with him as we take our own business forward on this important country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">I join with Ambassador De la Sablière in congratulating the Prime Minister on the progress his Government has made, including the presentation to the National Assembly of a comprehensive programme of work to implement the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. We warmly welcome the joint declaration of 4 July ending the hostilities on the ground, and we note with approval that the security situation on the ground in Côte d'Ivoire has improved. I think that the work that is being done on the implementation of the Agreement owes a great deal to the personal input and dedicated response of the Prime Minister personally.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">But as he has indicated to us, we all have to be aware that progress on some important issues identified by the mission has been mixed. There is a lot more still to do. We would like to see a very early date for the adoption by the National Assembly of the amnesty law. We would like to see, finally, the appointment of fully responsible ministers of defence and interior security. We would like to see also the further extension of Government services throughout the country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">We have had an important briefing on the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme -- and we also had a foretaste of the excellent dinner which the Prime Minister gave us in Abidjan. This is a good programme. In some ways it can form the elements of a model for the United Nations in taking forward a DDR programme, but it needs to be implemented, and those time lines need to be adhered to.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The United kingdom will fully support the Prime Minister's efforts to make progress in this and in the other areas, and, as he will know from this meeting this morning, the Council will be following up assiduously to make sure that implementation proceeds.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">The United Kingdom recognizes the importance of continuing international support to Côte d'Ivoire in this period. We have promised an additional 1 million pounds sterling to ECOMICI, and we strongly encourage other potential donors to do the same.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">As the Prime Minister has underlined to us, the long-term target for Côte d'Ivoire remains successful elections in 2005. The holding of those elections is closely connected with the full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, and it was very good to have the full understanding of President Gbagbo in Abidjan about that when we were there. Since meeting that deadline is going to require very careful preparation for the elections themselves, we would be very glad to have confirmation from the Prime Minister as to whether the Government will ask for United Nations and international assistance in that, because I think that that would be a very positive sign.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">We are grateful to France for the draft of the presidential statement which I hope we can adopt later. It forms an important element of the Council's follow-up to our missions this summer to Africa.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zhang Yishan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I wish first of all to comment on Ambassador Greenstock's departure from the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Ambassador Greenstock will be leaving us to take up his new responsibilities. He was involved in the drafting of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a> on Iraq -- indeed the United Kingdom was a sponsor of that resolution. He therefore has an excellent understanding of that resolution; it can even be said that he is an expert on it. I am convinced, therefore, that in his new capacity he will work in the spirit of the Security Council. He has a very good understanding of the Council's attitude, position and even sentiments towards that resolution. I believe that he will do his best to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a>; he was present when it was unanimously adopted. I am certain that he will make a further contribution to peace and reconstruction in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">I wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of my country and of my delegation and on my own behalf, to wish him every success in his new capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this important meeting. The peace process in Côte d'Ivoire is now at a crucial stage. It is therefore a very timely meeting, and it is necessary for the Council to listen to the briefing and to exchange views on this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">The Chinese delegation wishes to thank the Prime Minister of Côte d'Ivoire, Mr. Diarra, for having come to New York from afar to brief us on recent events in that country. We welcome his presence here, and we thank him for his visit. We deeply appreciate the efforts made by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire to implement the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, to bring about national reconciliation and to maintain national stability.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We welcome the joint declaration signed on 4 July between the Côte d'Ivoire national defence and security forces and Forces nouvelles. This declaration undoubtedly is of crucial importance to the peace process in Côte d'Ivoire. We have also noted that the Government of Côte d'Ivoire has already presented the amnesty law to the National Assembly, and we hope it will be adopted very soon. We support the full implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration  programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">China has always closely followed the situation in Côte d'Ivoire. It is our sincere hope that the parties there will proceed from the fundamental interests of the country and the nation, bury the hatchet and strengthen cooperation in a spirit of mutual understanding. We hope they will sincerely implement the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and the Accra Agreement so as to achieve national stability at an early date and to create a sound environment for the economic and social development of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">Peace and reconstruction in Côte d'Ivoire cannot be separated from the support and help of the international community. The Chinese delegation appreciates the peace efforts by the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and France in the country. We support the work of the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire under the leadership of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and in accordance with the mandate of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">China calls upon the international community, especially the donor countries, to continue to provide generous support to the people and Government of Côte d'Ivoire. We call upon the donor countries to provide ECOWAS with further support in order to facilitate its peacekeeping efforts there. We support the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and ECOWAS so as to further promote the peace and reconciliation process in the country. I sincerely hope that process of peace, reconciliation and development in Côte d'Ivoire will be smooth. I also hope that the people will move towards peace, stability and prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">Countries in West Africa are closely interwoven and have influence with each other. We favour the proposal by the Council's West African mission that a regional approach be adopted to settle the conflicts there. We believe that the rampant activities of professional mercenaries, the proliferation of small arms and the illegal exploitation of natural resources lead to instability in West Africa. But it is a fact that poverty is a root cause of such problems. Therefore, the eradication of poverty, along with economic development, is the fundamental way out for achieving lasting peace in West Africa. The United Nations must carefully study this issue -- how to help the West African countries eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">First, Mr. President, I would like to join you and the Chinese Ambassador in thanking Ambassador Greenstock for his cooperation in the Council and for his personal friendship. We will miss him when he is gone, and we wish him well in his new and very important job.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">I wish to welcome His Excellency Prime Minister Diarra to the Security Council and to thank him for his readiness to personally inform the Council about the progress in inter-Ivoirian reconciliation process. I also wish to thank him for the warm hospitality he extended to the Security Council mission that visited Abidjan at the beginning of this month and for the substantial discussions the mission was able to have with him.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">We recognize the important reconciliatory role that the Prime Minister has played to this point. We hope that the progress attained so far solidifies to the point of restoration of State unity, and that the process will gain momentum. We are cautiously optimistic, although some important open questions -- such as the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme, the amnesty law and citizenship -- still have to be resolved. In that context, we appreciate very much the briefing on the implementation of DDR this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">Together with our European partners, and as a member of the Security Council, Germany will continue to accompany and support the peace process. Only yesterday the Council discussed the follow-up to the mission to West Africa and endorsed its recommendations. The message this mission conveyed to all its interlocutors remains the same -- the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement has to be implemented, and the Security Council therefore intends to keep the developments in Côte d'Ivoire under close review.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">We thank the Prime Minister for the comprehensive briefing on the current situation. With his permission, I would like to follow up with a few questions. In his view, when will the nomination of the definitive Ministers of Defence and the Interior take place? Secondly, what effects does the 4 July joint declaration by the Forces armées nationales of Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles have on the work of the Government, and is there now a prospect that through a joint military course of action the partition of the country will end soon? What will be the effects on the re-establishment of State and administrative structures in the part of the country controlled by the Mouvement patriotique de Côte d'Ivoire (MPCI)? Are there concrete plans that have been accepted by the MPCI for reconstruction in the north? My last question pertains to the amnesty law that the Prime Minister mentioned would be discussed by the Ivoirian parliament on 4 August. Could he tell us what are the chances that this law will be adopted quickly, and which acts will be granted amnesty and for which period?</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">I wish to thank the Prime Minister again for his important visit and for his commitment, under sometimes difficult circumstances, to move the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and the reconciliation process forward. I can assure him he has our full support.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">Lastly, I wish to support the draft presidential statement prepared by France.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">At the outset I must express my appreciation to my neighbour, Ambassador Greenstock. I wish to add my voice to the President's observations at the start of this meeting on his role in strengthening the Security Council. Let me stress to him that we shall miss his constructive role and deep experience.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">It is a pleasure to warmly welcome His Excellency the Prime Minister of the Reconciliation Government in Côte d'Ivoire, Mr. Diarra. Let me express our appreciation to him for his personal efforts and those of his Government to attain peace in that friendly country. Let me also welcome the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. We fully appreciate his efforts to achieve peace and national reconciliation in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The Security Council mission recently returned from Côte d'Ivoire. Our main objective was to promote the peace process there and to ensure respect by all parties of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. We shall support all steps by the Prime Minister to implement that Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">We and Côte d'Ivoire, that friendly country, have recently witnessed much pain and suffering. We believe the time has come for the friendly people of Côte d'Ivoire to enjoy security and national reconciliation. We believe the peace process must move forward. In that context, we welcome the 4 July joint statement of the Forces nationales and the Forces nouvelles in Côte d'Ivoire declaring an end to hostilities, support for the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra Agreements and loyalty to President Gbagbo and to the Government of National Reconciliation, headed by Prime Minister Diarra. The statement also expressed the resolve to implement the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme in the country. The Syrian delegation calls on all the parties to fully and expeditiously implement all provisions of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements in order to ensure full participation and transparency in the country. We welcome the fact that Prime Minister Diarra stressed that very concept in his statement a short while ago.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">My delegation appreciates the efforts being made by countries members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), by ECOWAS forces and by France on behalf of peace. We also call on donor countries and on international financial institutions to provide the material financial and logistical assistance needed to enable the ECOWAS forces to continue to carry out their mission of ensuring peace and security in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">My delegation reaffirms its support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Côte d'Ivoire and for all the specialized agencies and programmes working in the region. We support their efforts to assist Côte d'Ivoire in overcoming the exceptional circumstances that have befallen it in the past few months. My delegation also supports the draft presidential statement on Côte d'Ivoire now before the Security Council that the representative of France was kind enough to introduce.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aguilar Zinser</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">My delegation wishes the Prime Minister of Côte d'Ivoire and his delegation a warm welcome to New York and to this Security Council meeting. We believe that his presence here reaffirms his Government's commitment to the tasks that the Council has been carrying out, most particularly the mission to West Africa -- especially Côte d'Ivoire -- that took place several weeks ago.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">That mission, headed by Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, took place at a very important time for moving the peace process forward in Côte d'Ivoire. Thus it is no coincidence that it was led by Ambassador Greenstock, who is sitting with us for the last time in the Security Council. My delegation wishes to express to him our affection, our friendship and our appreciation for the work done here during the time when he represented his country. We shared a substantial part of that time with Ambassador Greenstock, and we were able to observe not only his great diplomatic professionalism but also his great human qualities as our colleague in the Council, where we had many opportunities to agree and occasionally to disagree. In both situations, we found his human qualities to be an example by which to continue our friendship and affection in the future. We wish Ambassador Greenstock every success in his difficult and complex mission, and we assure him that the Council will be following his work in Iraq closely.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">The efforts that we have been pursuing in West Africa have a special dimension in Côte d'Ivoire. We believe that peace in Côte d'Ivoire is closely linked to political development, to the creation of security conditions and to economic and social development in the whole region. Côte d'Ivoire has a strategic role in mobilizing resources for economic activity in the whole region, and therefore peace in Côte d'Ivoire also means peace and prosperity for West Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">That is why we salute the progress made in the political transition and in the prospects for the consolidation of national reconciliation. We believe that that calls for unequivocal commitments by all parties to the full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements. In that connection, Mexico welcomes the 4 July joint statement of Côte d'Ivoire's armed forces and security forces and of the armed forces of the Forces nouvelles, through which the end of the war in that country was declared, allegiance to the President of the Republic and to the Government of National Reconciliation was reaffirmed, and all residents were urged to take the road of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">In that respect, my delegation joins the delegation of Germany in asking the Prime Minister what prospects exist to move forward the process of full reunification and the establishment of authority for reconciliation and transition throughout the country's territory. We reaffirm Mexico's support for the full implementation of the recommendations submitted by the Security Council mission to West Africa, particularly with regard to the holding of elections in 2005. We believe that the United Nations and the rest of the international community must lend their assistance to the electoral process, including with regard to the establishment of a trustworthy electoral register and the creation of an autonomous authority that gives transparency to the process with a view to creating conditions for a lasting peace in that country. In that respect, we should like to ask the Prime Minister what progress, in his opinion, is taking place in his country in order to hold those elections as the culminating point in the peace process, from which we hope a new political structure will be consolidated, providing stability to Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Similarly, we call on the senior authorities of Côte d'Ivoire to arrive at a prompt solution with regard to the full composition of the Transitional Government that considers all of its components, in the terms set forth by the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements and by subsequent agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">Another aspect that will be crucial in the coming months is that related to the adoption of all measures necessary for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme to move ahead -- according to what has been presented to us this morning -- and on schedule. Special attention should be devoted to disarming groups of youths in order to ensure security for the populations and to eliminate threats to the political solution that is supported by all the parties in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The recurring problems of the excessive availability of small arms and light weapons and the use of mercenaries and of child soldiers are viewed by Security Council members as unacceptable, not only in the case of Côte d'Ivoire but throughout the region. Regrettably, that is a situation that prevails in other conflict regions in Africa, including in West Africa. Thus we believe that the Security Council and the rest of the international community must take robust steps to put an end to arms trafficking and to the practice of using mercenaries, and that they should do everything in their power to prevent minors from being recruited as combatants. That will be a guarantee of a future without violence.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">We hope that presidential statements on Côte d'Ivoire and the statements made in the context of the Security Council missions to Central and Western Africa will be properly followed up.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">Mercenaries and arms trafficking are critical problems for the region, and they are aggravated by the situation in Liberia. Unfortunately, the violence in Liberia has not subsided and there is no immediate relief in sight. Further fighting and attacks on the civilian population in the capital, Monrovia, have been reported today. In that regard, I would like to ask the Prime Minister how he believes the worsening conflict in Liberia is affecting his country now and what impact it will have in the future. We know what efforts his country has made to try to prevent the conflict in Liberia from spilling over into Côte d'Ivoire. What is the current situation in that regard?</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa11">We are concerned about the humanitarian situation Côte d'Ivoire, which is still fragile, and has been aggravated by the arrival of refugees from Liberia. We appeal to the countries of the region and all parties in Côte d'Ivoire to guarantee security and unrestricted access to humanitarian organizations so that they can perform their functions for the benefit of vulnerable populations that are suffering under these unfortunately conditions of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa12">We reiterate our belief that a key role is to be played by humanitarian organizations, specialized United Nations personnel and non-governmental organizations. We again underline the importance of providing them with protection and unrestricted access to areas where they need to attend to the civilian population.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa13">Today's debate must go beyond statements. It is essential for the Government and other parties in Côte d'Ivoire, as well as the United Nations, regional and subregional organizations, civil society and other actors involved, to move ahead with the fulfilment of their respective commitments and mandates. This is required for the consolidation of the peace process and for stability and security in the country and the subregion. This should become part of a collective effort to return to the path of economic and social development, for the benefit, in particular, of the least privileged.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa14">I would like to conclude by stressing the importance of the Council's ensuring effective follow-up of its efforts, of the commitments set out in its resolutions and presidential statements and of the observations made during Council missions to various countries -- in this case, Côte d'Ivoire. We believe that follow-up by the Security Council in the coming months of developments in Côte d'Ivoire will be critical in providing support to enable the authorities in that country to reach the internal consensus needed to fulfil the requirements of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and the political timetable envisaged.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa15">Once again, we reiterate the importance of the Security Council's keeping its attention focused on this matter, so that, through such follow-up, it can contribute to the consolidation of the developments that are under way and avoid any pitfalls.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gaspar Martins</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I would like to start by joining my colleagues who have already paid tribute to Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, who is, unfortunately, with us for the last time as he is due to leave. It is a symbolic coincidence that he should be here for the last time today, as we are discussing the Côte d'Ivoire mission, which he led. That was a very successful mission, and made a very significant contribution to our current discussions on that subject. We are looking at Côte d'Ivoire from a different perspective as a result of the success of the mission that he led. I wish Ambassador Greenstock great success in the new tasks that he will be tackling in a very sensitive area. His very significant contribution to the work of the Council when we discussed Iraq will stand him in good stead in his new mission. I hope that we will be seeing Ambassador Greenstock often, since he will be coming back from time to time -- wearing a different hat, but still talking to the many friends that he has made here in the Council and elsewhere in the United Nations. I wish him good luck.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Turning to Côte d'Ivoire, I would like to welcome, and say that I am very honoured to see, Prime Minister Diarra, Foreign Minister Bamba Mamadou and the entire Ivorian delegation with us this morning. I would like to commend Prime Minister Diarra for the reconciliatory and leadership role that he has been playing in the process of national reconstruction in his country. His presence is also gratifying because it gives an opportunity for the Security Council to address the issue of Côte d'Ivoire once again, with him here to explain some of the points that the Council still needs to be clarified in order to advance and fully support the positive efforts that he has been making.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">I would like also to say that I am pleased to see Special Representative Albert Tevoedjre. We were very pleased about the teamwork that he established with the Ivorian authorities. That teamwork is, I think, also a factor in the success that we are now experiencing in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The great achievements made since the inauguration of the Government of National Reconciliation on 13 March 2003, thanks to the efforts of President Laurent Gbagbo and Prime Minister Diarra, are proof of the political will of the Ivorian forces and the determination of the international community to address this crisis. It is our conviction that the same political will will prevail to address all pending issues, namely, the appointment of effective interior and defence ministers; the extension of Government services and State authority throughout the territory; the adoption of the amnesty law; and the implementation of the disarmament and reintegration programme.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">We are pleased with the information and the assurances that have been given to the Council this morning by Prime Minister Diarra with regard to the steps that have been effectively taken in that respect. We will review this as we have reviewed the other elements.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">As my delegation stated during one of the consultation meetings, the progress made in the field of political dialogue will only be sustainable if military aspects are properly addressed. In that connection, we welcome the joint declaration by the defence and security forces of Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles, which was made 48 hours after the Security Council mission departed Côte d'Ivoire and following the assurances we received from President Gbagbo and Prime Minister Diarra when we were in the country. That step is really a very positive development. The parties should be encouraged to continue to work in the same constructive manner they have already demonstrated as they implement the declaration. Again, that is one specific example of what has been achieved.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">As stated in the report of the Security Council mission to West Africa, "Although Côte d'Ivoire remains an issue of serious concern for the subregion and the international community, the precise modalities of implementing the Agreement are largely a matter for internal Ivorian discussion". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2003-688.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/688</a>, para. 35</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">It is clear from that conclusion that, in order to reach all the goals related to the pending issues, the Ivorians should continue to play a key role, as indeed has been the case.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">One very meaningful lesson can be drawn from the crisis in Côte d'Ivoire regarding the response of the international community, namely, that the continued efforts of the Economic Community of West African States, France, the African Union, the United Nations and the international community as a whole is producing the desired result due to the fact that the political will of the parties is increasingly evident. The harmonious, concerted and timely response of the international community is a determining factor if we are to succeed in tackling crises of the dimension of the one in Côte d'Ivoire, as is the case in the entire subregion of West Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">The efforts of the international community will be incomplete unless they are followed by further action to support the post-conflict period. There is therefore a need for the international community to continue to respond to the appeal made at the donors conference held in Paris on 18 July, bearing in mind that a positive impact on the West African region is directly dependent on the recovery of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa11">The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme that has been presented to the Security Council this morning by Prime Minister Diarra will make a positive contribution to peace and stability in Côte d'Ivoire. We therefore support it, and urge the Council to give it very positive consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa12">The prevailing situation in Liberia is a matter of concern, as it can have a negative effect on the sustainable peace we are seeing emerging in Côte d'Ivoire. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to reiterate the urgent need for the Council to find a solution to that burning crisis as well.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa13">France has presented us with a draft presidential statement that contains elements that I think will have our support. We would be very pleased to approve it later in the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diallo</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">As this is Ambassador Greenstock's last Security Council meeting in his capacity as the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, I would like, before I address the issue under consideration, to convey to Ambassador Greenstock my delegation's gratitude for his invaluable contribution to the success of our work. His constant presence, sense of moderation and many talents have had a special impact on our deliberations by helping us to work our way out of difficult situations on numerous occasions. In particular, I would like to commend the momentum he has brought to the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. His example should be emulated.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">This meeting on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is a further welcome step towards supporting the peace process in that friendly country since the signing of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. I would like to welcome the presence here today of the important delegation from Côte d'Ivoire, which is headed by Prime Minister Seydou Elimane Diarra. I wish to extend to him our gratitude for the informative briefing he has just given us on the achievements that have been made, in particular since the establishment of the Government of National Reconciliation. Those achievements must be fully supported. I would also like to thank the authorities of Côte d'Ivoire for the warm reception they extended to the Security Council mission during its recent visit to West Africa. I would also like to welcome the presence here today of Mr. Albert Tevoedjre, Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">As a neighbouring country, Guinea is pleased to note the gradual return of normalcy in Côte d'Ivoire after many months of serious instability. That positive development was possible due to the political will of all parties, as well as the sustained support of the international community. Despite the complexity and sensitive nature of the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire, we are fortunate to have been able to count on the timely and positive involvement of France and the Economic Community of West African States in providing a successful solution to the crisis. Those efforts should be continued for the sake of the people of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the tasks still to be accomplished are both enormous and decisive, and that much sacrifice must still be made. There can be no doubt that the restoration of lasting peace in Côte d'Ivoire, as well as its economic recovery, depend on completing those tasks. In carrying out that historic mission, each actor will be judged according to his contribution.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">Despite a number of differences on several key issues, there is reason for hope given the progress that has already been made. In that regard, I would like to mention the progress mentioned by Prime Minister Seydou Elimane Diarra, especially the joint declaration of 4 July announcing the end of the war made by the Forces armées de Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles. I would also mention the adoption by the Council of Ministers of a draft amnesty law to be considered early next month at a special session of the National Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">My delegation believes that meeting the challenges confronting the people of Côte d'Ivoire involves all of us: the people of Côte d'Ivoire, the people of the subregion and us at the international level. We must acknowledge that achieving this joint mission is primarily up to the parties in Côte d'Ivoire themselves. Everyone must work towards peace and national reconciliation, the path towards which has now been charted. The international community has great expectations for the final restoration of normalcy and stability in Côte d'Ivoire, a country in which, regardless of background, every member of the civilian population will be reconciled for the sake of all.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khalid</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">First, I would like to join others in conveying our warm sentiments of friendship and best wishes to Ambassador Greenstock. His contribution to the deliberations of the Security Council was no doubt valuable and will be long remembered. I am sure that his many outstanding qualities will be an asset in his new assignment. It is also my pleasure to join others in welcoming Mr. Seydou Diarra and his delegation to today's public meeting. Let me also thank the Spanish presidency for convening this meeting. It testifies to the continued and sustained attention that the Security Council gives to the situation in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">The visit to the United Nations of Prime Minister Diarra comes in the wake of the recent mission of the Security Council to the West African subregion, among whose main destinations was Abidjan. Earlier, in April, the Security Council discussed the situation in Côte d'Ivoire in a public meeting, with the participation of a high-level ministerial delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Côte d'Ivoire has a clear road map to peace in the form of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. The people of Côte d'Ivoire have courageously and wisely opted for that path. The success of the peace process hinges on the faithful implementation of that agreement. That is also the mandate of the Government of national reconciliation. We thank the Prime Minister for his briefing today, which outlined the significant progress made in the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, as well as some key areas in which work remains to be accomplished.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">We support the Council's action. We encourage the authorities and all parties in Côte d'Ivoire to work towards full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. We hope that the people of Côte d'Ivoire will be able to achieve the desired objectives of peace and stability in the spirit of national reconciliation. In that regard, we laud the efforts being made by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Côte d'Ivoire has withstood the turmoil that accompanied the unfortunate developments that, one after the other, have struck the country since September last year. However, the crisis is not yet over. A lot of damage has been done in all spheres of national life: political, security, economic, social and human rights. Beyond national frontiers, the subregion as a whole has suffered the negative fallout of the crisis in Côte d'Ivoire. Therefore, the need and urgency of remedying the situation is felt by all. Côte d'Ivoire is fortunate that in its hour of crisis, it has been the beneficiary of timely assistance and support at various levels: bilateral, regional and international. We appreciate the role played by France and ECOWAS in stabilizing the situation there. The United Nations is also actively engaged in the peace process through the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire (MINUCI) and the Special Representative, Mr. Tevoedjre, who is present here. His special efforts merit special mention.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">Apart from the political process, the challenge of economic rehabilitation and reconstruction requires the continued support of the international community. Pakistan joins the appeal to the donor community for adequate contributions in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">One central conclusion that emerges from the consideration of conflict situations in Africa and elsewhere is the need for parallel progress on several interrelated tracks: credible security, developing consensus solutions, humanitarian relief for suffering people, provisional justice and economic revival, including through adequate economic assistance. Addressing those complex issues should be the responsibility not only of the Security Council but of all organs of the United Nations -- perhaps through the mechanism of composite committees, which our delegation has suggested on previous occasions.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">First, I wish to join in the expressions of farewell to Ambassador Greenstock through his alternate representative present here. We wish Ambassador Greenstock the best of luck in his tasks. We are certain that we will have the pleasure to witness his kindness and professionalism in the tasks that he will perform in Iraq, which is an issue of concern to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">Secondly, I welcome the presence here of Prime Minister Diarra because we are fully aware of the importance of his role and of the efforts that he has made to safeguard the road to peace, which has been constructed with patience and tenacity in Côte d'Ivoire, overcoming the numerous obstacles encountered so far.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">Despite that progress, much remains to be done. We will need to face resolutely the obstacles and dangers, among which is regional instability. I agree with the various speakers preceding me who pointed to the situation in Liberia as a special concern of the Council that could have negative repercussions for the stability of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">We reiterate our full support for strict compliance with the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and the Accra II Agreement concerning the holding of free and open elections by 2005. We agree that the necessary steps must be taken to avoid a deterioration of the current peaceful situation, in particular -- as the Council heard this morning -- the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, which must be carried out without delay. We welcome the fact that the considered and planned steps are being taken.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">A subject that has always been of special importance to my country is the need to deal with impunity for crimes against human rights. No national reconciliation process can neglect that vital element. Any process of national reconstruction and reconciliation that omits that matter is, in short, a weak reconciliation process. We therefore hope that those guilty of crimes against human rights will be brought to justice -- with a dose of realism but also with a determination to see justice done. In particular, we are concerned about the rights of children and the forced recruitment of children as soldiers. Here, efforts need to be made by all sectors.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">Due to all the reasons I have mentioned, we support the draft presidential statement, and we sincerely wish the Prime Minister and his Government every success in the tasks remaining to ensure stability and peace in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Smirnov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">At the outset, our delegation would like to join in the warm words and wishes for the respected Ambassador Greenstock.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">We are grateful to the Prime Minister of Côte d'Ivoire, Mr. Diarra, for his briefing on the development of the situation in the country. We support him in his efforts to advance the peace process in Côte d'Ivoire. We are encouraged by the considerable progress made in the settlement there in the context of the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, thanks to the efforts of the President and of Mr. Diarra, who heads the New Government of National Reconciliation. We note in particular the signing on 4 July by the defence and security forces of Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles of the declaration formally ending the hostilities.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Much remains to be done, however, for the full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. At this time, the most pressing problems facing the country are the implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme; the extension of Government authority to areas still under the control of the Forces nouvelles; the appointment of the ministers of defence and national security; and the finalization of procedures to adopt the amnesty law and measures to promote economic recovery.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">We deem it important for all political forces in Côte d'Ivoire fully and promptly to implement all provisions of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and other accords in order to proceed smoothly and methodically towards the establishment of conditions of stability for the 2005 elections.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">It is important also for all players in the peace process in Côte d'Ivoire to make every effort to ensure that human rights are safeguarded.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">We note the considerable role of the mediation efforts of regional leaders in advancing the peace process. We commend the fruitful efforts of the Monitoring Committee, headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. We fully support the activities of the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire (MINUCI) and expect that all forces in the country will fully and comprehensively cooperate with it. Russian representatives and liaison officers are ready to take part in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">We also commend the peacekeeping efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries and of France and share the concerns expressed as to the logistical and financial difficulties encountered by the ECOWAS forces. We join the appeal to donor countries to continue to support those forces.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">We are ready to support the draft presidential statement, as prepared on the initiative of the French delegation.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Belinga-Eboutou</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I should like at the outset to join you, Madam President, and other speakers in thanking Ambassador Greenstock for everything he has done with us and among us. We thank him for his interest in, and commitment to, Africa, where he skillfully headed several Security Council missions. On a personal note, we will not soon forget his friendly assistance during Cameroon's presidency of the Security Council and during consultations on the question of Iraq in October 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">I should like to thank you, Madam, for having convened this open meeting on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire, which enables us to assess the progress made towards achieving peace and stability in Côte d'Ivoire. The inclusion of this item in the agenda of your presidency attests once again to the ongoing interest of your country in the promotion of international peace and security, in Africa in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Indeed, a Security Council mission to West Africa recently visited Côte d'Ivoire. Côte d'Ivoire received it in a manner befitting the body with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security -- with much honour, but also, and most importantly, with a great deal of hope.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">Today Côte d'Ivoire is returning the favour. Indeed, today the Security Council is meeting with all of Côte d'Ivoire through Mr. Seydou Diarra, consensus Prime Minister and head of the Government of National Reconciliation, who embodies all of the Ivorian social and political sensibilities and is a tangible manifestation of the historical compromise represented by the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. He enjoys the full confidence of Laurent Gbagbo, President of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">My delegation in turn joins its voice to that of the President of the Security Council and of preceding speakers who have warmly welcomed the consensus Prime Minister, Mr. Seydou Diarra, and to thank and congratulate him for his important statement, which is both a stock-taking of what his Government has achieved and an indication of the actions that remain to be taken. His presence here attests to the degree to which the Ivorian people, who rightfully aspire to peace and seek to restore Côte d'Ivoire to its place in the international arena, have confidence in the Security Council and hence in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">The Security Council has spared no effort to see that his country regain its established reputation as a model of stability and an island of economic prosperity that was, until recently, the pride of many Africans.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">Through the actions of the Security Council, the international community is standing with Côte d'Ivoire, determined and resolved to support it as it moves ever forward towards peace.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">By adopting, on 4 February 2003, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1464(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1464 (2003)</a>, the Security Council endorsed the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, which was approved by the Kleber conference of heads of State, and called upon all Ivorian political forces fully to comply with it.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">Today's discussion is an opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved since that time. Under the authority of the head of State, the Government of National Reconciliation, headed by the consensus Prime Minister with his well-known wisdom and brilliance, has, in an environment that does not give rise to optimism, made tremendous progress in the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. The important statement made by the Prime Minister is telling in this regard, as is the presentation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">The conclusion that can be drawn is the one stated by the Prime Minister himself at the end of his briefing - that the crisis is now in the process of ending.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa11">The determination of all components of the Ivorian population has made it possible effectively to lay the foundation for a lasting peace whose elements are gradually and methodically being instituted, with the support of the international community. Cameroon commends this, particularly since, as the Council is aware, President Paul Biya, who personally took part in the Linas-Marcoussis conference of heads of State, is a moral guarantor in this process.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa12">Today the military forces of both camps have declared the end of the war and have recognized the authority of the head of State and of the Government of National Reconciliation. In so doing they have committed themselves to supporting the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and the Accra accords. This is an important step towards ending the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa13">The Parliament will soon consider the amnesty bill, as submitted by the Government and firmly supported by the President of the Republic. The scope of this law is vast, for, as underscored in the governmental communiqué, it will provide for a general pardon that recommends that each citizen make a resolute choice to move beyond self-interest and to embrace mutual tolerance.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa14">In that context, Cameroon has no doubt that the programme of the Government of National Reconciliation, supported before the parliament on 28 May, will be continued and that the elections of October 2005 will be elections of transparency -- as the Prime Minister said -- of reconciliation and of a restored nation. In that regard, restoring the State's authority by extending the administration throughout the territory is becoming a priority.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa15">It is gratifying that the European Commission has approved an immediate recovery programme after the crisis in Côte d'Ivoire. The programme has as its objectives, inter alia, financing the extension of the administration and supporting the process of demobilizing combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa16">Côte d'Ivoire finds itself at a crucial time in its history. More than ever before, it needs to enjoy the committed and renewed support of the international community and of the United Nations, particularly the Security Council. In that context, the Council needs to send a strong message to the Ivorian people and leaders and to the entire West Africa subregion -- a message clearly reiterating its approval of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, once again underscoring the paramount necessity of its full implementation and urging all Ivorians to refrain from any action that could undermine the momentum towards an emergence from the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa17">Here, I must express our appreciation to the President of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, for his trust in the Prime Minister and in his Government. We express our encouragement to the Ivorian people and to that country's vital forces, resolutely committed to and oriented towards reconciliation and national unity. We should like to reaffirm our support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Côte d'Ivoire and Chairman of the Monitoring Committee for the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, Mr. Albert Tevoedjre. We pay tribute to him for his actions and for his commitment to the advent of peace and harmony in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa18">In conclusion, I should like to indicate my delegation's support for the draft presidential statement prepared by the French delegation and submitted by Ambassador De La Sablière. That text contains certain elements and guidelines to be taken into account for the successful continuation of the implementation of the programme of the Government of National Reconciliation that was supported before the parliament on 28 May. Clearly, the continuation of that programme requires the stability of the Government and the stability of the Prime Minister -- by consensus the architect of a return to peace -- at the side of the President of the Republic. We are sure that the head of State will continue, with his usual wisdom, to ensure that his Prime Minister's action is, in the long run, in conformity with the spirit of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. Furthermore, that important aspect could, in my delegation's view, be incorporated into the draft presidential statement, which would thus be enriched.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rosenblatt</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">We would like to join other members in welcoming Prime Minister Diarra to the Security Council today, and take this opportunity to express the support of the United States for his efforts in moving the reconciliation process forward in Côte d'Ivoire. We listened with interest to his presentation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme, an integral part of that process.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">The United States fully supports the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis accords and the Prime Minister's efforts in that regard, and urges that he continue to look for ways to accelerate the implementation process. The latter would include the prompt appointment of permanent defence and interior ministers.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">We applaud the efforts of the armed forces of Côte d'Ivoire, working in conjunction with the military stabilization force of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Côte d'Ivoire and the French military unit in carrying out Operation Licorne, an effort to seal the Côte d'Ivoire-Liberia border. That operation has helped to hinder further munitions and arms from reaching the combatants in the deplorable civil strife in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Lastly, we should like to thank the Prime Minister for his Government's cooperation with the United Nations military liaison presence in Côte d'Ivoire and for welcoming the Security Council's mission to Abidjan. We also can support the draft presidential statement submitted by France.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I shall now speak in my capacity as representative of Spain.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">At the outset, I should like to thank the Prime Minister, Mr. Seydou Diarra, for his statement. I shall make a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">We welcome the progress that has been made in the peace process, and we encourage the country's authorities to work resolutely -- as they are doing -- to address the challenges facing the consolidation of the peace. In that regard, during the recent Security Council mission to West Africa, we reaffirmed the importance of implementing the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement as the only way to move forward on the path of peace and reconciliation. Today, once again, we urge all the political forces to implement that Agreement and Accra II.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">We believe, furthermore, that one of the principal challenges in the current stage is the extension of State authority throughout the country. During our first meeting with the President of the Republic, he indicated to us that he intended to begin sending public officials to the western part of the country in order to restore public services, now that security conditions permit it. We should like to know what progress has been made in that regard, and also how the Government of Côte d'Ivoire contemplates extending State authority to the northern part of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">We also believe it is important that, in the short term, the appointments of Government posts that are still pending be completed, as well as all high posts of the administration of the Government of Transition and National Reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">Finally, there are two other issues that my delegation considers relevant: the prompt implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme and, secondly, the parliamentary processing of the amnesty law, since that is an essential element for the return to democratic normalcy, always keeping in view the holding of presidential elections in 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">I give the floor to Prime Minister Diarra to make any further comments or to respond to any of the questions addressed to him by Council members.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diarra</span> <span class="nation">Cote d'Ivoire</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">I thank you, Mr. President, and all other members of the Security Council who have spoken of my country.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">I noted that there were 13 speakers; the problem of Côte d'Ivoire is clearly of concern to the international community. I would like to say that, as consensus Prime Minister, I was appointed by President Gbagbo following consultations with all of the political forces of Côte d'Ivoire. I am not a politician. I am a former ambassador who now, in his retirement, is thrust into the limelight. I am trying to bring together the people of Côte d'Ivoire and encourage them to work for development -- in particular in combating poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">I am working with a view to ensuring good governance, the rule of law, human rights and the restoration of State authority. We need to move forward in that direction together, and everyone must respect the rules of the game that have been established.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">Since my appointment as Prime Minister, it has been my concern to present a Government programme -- the Marcoussis programme -- that is also the programme of all the political forces of Côte d'Ivoire. That is what I am talking about -- this is not the Prime Minister's programme; it is the programme of the political forces who signed the agreement. The parliament has taken due note of that programme, and we have set to work to apply that programme up to 2005, trying to identify the decrees, laws, bills and regulatory texts that will determine Government action week by week until 2005. Our entire programme is well organized chronologically, and the first bill will be before through the parliament on 6 August.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">That draft law was debated in the Council of Ministers, and all the ministers from the various parties accepted it as it was. The President of the Republic has accepted it. There is now a separation of powers, and that bill will come to the parliament. We expect it to be adopted, because it will provide a platform for the peaceful coexistence that is now beginning. It would be no use starting off by leaving aside some of the people, who would then feel that they were excluded from the management of the country. I believe that, with the adoption of that bill, a new, decisive stage in the future of Côte d'Ivoire will undoubtedly begin.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">Council members asked a number of questions. With regard to the appointment of the ministers for defence and for security, the Council is aware that, following the Accra II Agreement, a 15-member national security council was established, presided over by the President. I am a member, as are the political parties signatories to the Agreement. From the beginning, I did not want to be involved in the appointment of the ministers for defence and for security. I sought to deal with that issue by making two temporary appointments, and I am working with those individuals. I left the President and the political parties to continue their consultations. Last week, before leaving Abidjan to come to New York, the President, with whom I met, asked me to deal primarily with the appointment of those two individuals. I also met with several political figures who asked me to take various initiatives in that regard, and upon my return I will be making a number of proposals to the President and the national security council, which is empowered to make the appointments. I think that these two weeks of intensive consultations will help to take a number of initiatives. That is what I wanted to say to reassure the Council about the appointment of those two individuals.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">I believe that much progress has been made with regard to the end of the division of the country into northern, southern and western areas. The regular defence forces, as well as the Forces nouvelles, have agreed that the war is over. We have already sent missions to the north and the west of Côte d'Ivoire. I can tell you now that the west has been completely pacified by the Operation Licorne forces and those of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). We can now say that there are no more weapons in those areas and that we can move about safely.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">We are seeking above all to bring the population back to those areas to resume their normal activities. In the north of Côte d'Ivoire the situation is still normal. In general, the population stayed in place, although some people were displaced. But in the west, because of the proximity to Liberia, the people had to flee the carnage. That area has now been pacified. Upon my return in August, I propose to undertake a three-week programme of travel throughout those areas, with the various forces involved in Côte d'Ivoire, so as to reassure the population and enable them to return to work.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">I truly believe that once we have begun the first important stage of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme -- the regrouping -- we will be able to say that Côte d'Ivoire has been pacified and made secure, and officials will be able to return to their tasks and duties in those northern and western areas. It should also be pointed out that last week, when I was in Brussels, the President met with the prefects and sub-prefects and asked them to return to their posts. However, everything has been destroyed. There are no more services for the prefects, and no buildings for the sub-prefects -- at least in the west and north. The administrative structure will have to be completely rebuilt. That was the purpose of my meeting with the European Commission in Brussels, as well as with the Belgian authorities, which are providing financial support to help us to set up the administration. We have prefects who have been well trained; we have teachers; we have doctors. Everyone is in place; we need only the resources with which to get down to work. With regard to the prefects, we also need mobility. Before leaving Côte d'Ivoire, I placed an order for vehicles so as to enable those high-level people within the administration to carry out their tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">By the end of September, therefore, we will have succeeded in putting the prefectures in place, as well as the teachers and doctors, so that, by the beginning of the school year in October, children will be able to return to school and resume their studies. I believe that all of that has been well planned.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">The beginning of the school year has been set for October in all parts of Côte d'Ivoire. We have obtained assistance from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and a number of non-governmental organizations to help the children from conflict zones who were unable to take examinations to catch up so that they will not be penalized by a war for which they were not responsible.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">That is what I wanted to say with regard to the appointments, the partition of the country and the regrouping and cantonment. The regrouping is important because I think that it enables us to bring about complete security throughout the territory. The soldiers will return to their quarters, the forces that were in the north will return to their regrouping areas. That will enable us to control all the thoroughfares and prevent armed attacks. Even when war is over, and even in Government-controlled areas, a soldier wandering about can be dangerous. The imperatives of security therefore require us to regroup them in such a way as to promote peace so that people and goods can move from Côte d'Ivoire as far as Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. This is being done at the moment through the economic corridor that has been put in place and that is functioning very well.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">The Ambassador of Germany asked about my assessment of the situation in Liberia. We have a long border with Liberia. For years now it has been a turbulent area. We have succeeded thus far in keeping the problem under control and in preventing the war from spilling over into Côte d'Ivoire. Events, however, have been such that we have had to deal with fronts in the north and the west -- a great deal for an army that was not ready to wage war.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa14">Thanks to the forces of France, the Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Forces armées nationales de Côte d'Ivoire and the Forces nouvelles, we are today together exercising control over the western border. We are doing so while embracing humanitarian issues, that is to say, by welcoming those who are seeking refuge in Côte d'Ivoire. Again, I think we have attempted to attach importance to the humanitarian aspect. We have for years even welcomed many non-Ivorian adults to Ivorian schools, many of whom have been employed in Côte d'Ivoire or joined its public service. However, what we are saying is that we do not want people to cross the border with weapons. In that regard, I believe the Government has given orders to prevent anyone entering the country with weapons. I also believe that it was our duty to do so in order to reassure the people of Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa15">We have to believe that the situation in Liberia will be resolved through the contacts that the Council has. That problem can only be resolved in the subregional context, and with the support of the international community. We in Côte d'Ivoire do not have the capacity to address it ourselves. ECOWAS countries, working with Ghana's President Kufuor, have certainly taken steps in that regard, but they too need financial and political support from the Security Council and States with interests in Liberia. We still believe that without that we will remain vulnerable to the situation in that country. We are making efforts. Much progress has been made. But that is not all there is to it. There must necessarily be involvement on the part of the international community, especially from States with interests in Liberia. ECOWAS forces are ready to deploy, but logistical and financial problems remain. Everyone knows that this is a very expensive undertaking. I therefore call upon the international community and the Member States of the Organization to quickly bring the Liberian war, which is disrupting the entire subregion, to an end. That is what I wanted to say with respect to the overall situation.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa16">Let me also say that the goal of the Government's programme is the holding of fair, transparent and open elections by 2005. We therefore make an additional appeal to take the necessary steps to ensure that the elections take place under normal conditions. We have in place in Côte d'Ivoire what we refer to as the national electoral commission, which is an independent body comprised of all political parties. That provides one guarantee. But we will also strengthen the role of the independent commission in order to avoid any sort of exclusion, so that once the elections are held we will be able to say that there is stability in the country, that there is a future for it and that everyone in Côte d'Ivoire is able to express himself.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa17">I must also add that, like some other countries, Côte d'Ivoire is also a melting pot -- a special country. Regardless of who wins the election, we must ensure that we involve the non-winning minorities. That too will ensure the country's stability. In the end, the people of Côte d'Ivoire -- the body politic -- has always wanted to take part in the running of the country. Democracy cannot prosper unless those who lose the election are included in the running of the country to some degree. I believe that the body politic should gradually be formed in that manner, so as to bring about unity, stability and inclusiveness. That is the most important thing: to avoid exclusion in our country.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa18">That is what I wanted to say to the Council. Let me say how much my delegation appreciates this morning's meeting. It is very important to us that 13 out of the 15 members of the Council -- I believe that number is correct -- have spoken. I want in particular to thank the Security Council for having sent a mission to Côte d'Ivoire. I also want to thank everyone who has participated in settling the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire. We wish to demonstrate to the international community that we will emerge from the crisis quickly and that we will return to, and improve upon, the level we had reached in the past. We have the ability, manpower and land to do so, including those who have chosen to live with us. That too is our goal. Reconciliation in Côte d'Ivoire will take place not only among Ivorians; it will also include all of our neighbours and the entire international community.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">I thank Prime Minister Diarra for his eloquent, realistic and hopeful words.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa03">"The Security Council reiterates the need for Ivorian political forces to implement fully and without delay all the provisions of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, as well as those of the agreement signed in Accra on 8 March 2003 ('Accra II'), with a view to open, free and transparent elections being held in 2005. The Council takes note with satisfaction of the formation of a government of national reconciliation and the progress made, particularly the identification of cantonment areas and the delegation of powers to the Prime Minister, and is looking forward to new progress in accordance with the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. The Council also welcomes the 'joint declaration by Côte d'Ivoire defence and security forces and the armed forces of the Forces Nouvelles' of 4 July 2003 (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-704.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/704</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa04">"The Security Council emphasizes, however, that much remains to be done to achieve the full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. In this regard, the Council endorses the recommendations of its mission to West Africa (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-668.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/668</a>). The Council calls on Ivorian political forces to redouble their efforts in the following areas: voting for the amnesty bill submitted to the National Assembly by the Government, the complete implementation of a 'disarmament, demobilization and reintegration' programme, the extension of public services and the authority of the State to areas still under control of the Forces Nouvelles, the appointment of ministers for defence and interior security, the guarantee of equal security for all ministers, the dismantling of militias throughout the country and the termination of the activities of mercenaries and of the purchase of weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa05">"The Security Council renews its support and encouragement to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Côte d'Ivoire. It asks him to keep the Council closely informed of developments towards the full implementation of the above objectives. It is pleased that the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire (MINUCI) is now operational and hopes it will soon be fully staffed, including in such crucial areas as the political and human rights components.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa06">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and France in contributing to a peaceful solution to the crisis. It welcomes in particular the satisfactory deployment of their peacekeeping forces in the western part of the country to support the implementation of the ceasefire reached on 3 May. The Council calls on Member States to continue to respond to the appeal made at the donors' conference in Paris on 18 July, attended by the Executive Secretary of ECOWAS and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and to provide logistic and financial support to the ECOWAS Mission in Cote d'Ivoire (ECOMICI) so that it can continue to fulfil its important mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa07">"The Security Council invites donor countries to contribute to the reconstruction of Côte d'Ivoire in compliance with the commitments undertaken at Kleber.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its concern at the continued existence of regional factors of instability, particularly the use of mercenaries and child soldiers, and the spread of small arms and light weapons which prevent a lasting solution to the crisis in the region. The Council requests the Secretary-General to submit recommendations to the Council as soon as possible on ways to combat such subregional and cross-border problems, focusing in particular on better coordination of United Nations efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa09">"The Security Council is convinced that a lasting solution to the problems of the subregion also requires genuine cooperation among all States concerned, together with confidence-building measures and the personal commitment of heads of State in the subregion."</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-11.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/11</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa12">Before concluding the meeting, I wish, on behalf of the Council, to express once again our thanks to Prime Minister Diarra for taking the time to brief the Council.</p>
