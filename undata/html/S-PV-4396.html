	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the recommendations of the Secretary-General on the next phase in the deployment of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), as contained in his report of 16 October 2001 (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-970.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/970</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council supports the initiation of phase III of the deployment of MONUC within the currently mandated ceiling and, in particular, its deployment towards the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council reminds the parties to the conflict that they are responsible for the continuation of the peace process. It is up to them to create and to maintain conditions conducive to the start of phase III of MONUC by fully implementing the commitments they have undertaken. The Council will take its decisions on the future of phase III of MONUC after ascertaining that the parties to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-815.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/815</a>) are committed to continuing, in a spirit of partnership, to make the efforts necessary to advance the peace process. The next meeting between the Security Council and members of the Political Committee established by the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement will provide an opportunity to discuss these issues.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council recalls the importance it places on the implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and the relevant resolutions of the Council. In particular, the Council calls on those States which have not yet done so to withdraw from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in accordance with the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and the relevant Security Council resolutions; calls on all parties to cease any support for armed groups and to implement the process of disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration of the groups referred to in annex A, Chapter 9.1, of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement; emphasizes the importance of the inter-Congolese dialogue and calls on the Congolese parties to work together for the success of this process; and demands the demilitarization of Kisangani, in conformity with its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1304(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1304 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council expresses serious concern at the worsening humanitarian and human rights situation, particularly in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and reiterates its call for all the parties to urgently address the human rights abuses, including those raised in the ninth report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-970.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/970</a>), in the Government-controlled territory, the territory controlled by the Front de Libération du Congo and the territory controlled by the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-29.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/29</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">I should like in closing to express the appreciation of the Council for the continued excellent support that we have received from our colleagues in the Secretariat, including today, United Nations Day.</p>
