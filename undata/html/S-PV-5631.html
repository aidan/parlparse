<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Guangya</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">It was three years ago, under the Chinese presidency, that the Security Council authorized the immediate deployment of the Multinational Interim Force in Haiti, which was followed by the establishment of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Over the past three years, with the firm support of all parties, including China, MINUSTAH has played a crucial role in Haiti by stabilizing the situation, conducting presidential and parliamentary elections and launching post-conflict reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">In his most recent report (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-1003.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/1003</a>), the Secretary-General indicates that the security environment continues to be relatively stable in most of the country and that various reconstruction programmes are ongoing. China welcomes those developments and highly appreciates MINUSTAH's efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">Together with the progress being made in the peace and reconstruction processes, there have been major changes in the principal challenges facing Haiti. The United Nations, and MINUSTAH in particular, must respond to that changed situation by updating the Mission's mandate, reordering its priorities and adjusting its composition so that it can more effectively meet the current needs of the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">We believe that, in the coming period, MINUSTAH's central task will be to assist Haiti in the transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding. Haiti's progress towards stability and development will depend on the long-term support of the international community. Essentially, however, such progress will depend mainly on Haiti itself.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">The Haitian people, with their security and safety needs largely met, are increasingly demanding improved living conditions, a revitalized reconciliation process, economic development, social justice and the rule of law. The elected Government should take positive steps to fulfil their desire for a credible, competent and transparent Government. We also hope that the Government will honour its commitments to the people and to its international partners, because that is essential for the sustainable engagement of MINUSTAH.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">On the basis of those considerations, China proposed a number of amendments to the draft resolution during the Council's consultations. We proposed extending MINUSTAH's mandate for six months, in keeping with general practice related to United Nations peacekeeping operations. At the same time, we requested the Secretary-General to carry out a comprehensive assessment and to report to the Council on the changed situation and the security risks in Haiti so that, before discussing and taking a decision on the next extension of MINUSTAH's mandate, the Council will have a chance to determine the overall functions of the Mission and devise a feasible and viable long-term strategy for both the United Nations and Haiti. Because such an assessment might be time-consuming for MINUSTAH, China agreed to an extension for a reasonable period, as an ad hoc arrangement, beyond the original six months. Also, we hope that the Council will continue to follow previous practice regarding the duration of MINUSTAH's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">MINUSTAH recently reinforced its military operations against armed gangs. Although they are necessary for the short term, those military operations cannot be a long-term strategy. Certain paragraphs of the draft resolution overemphasize military means while failing to pay adequate attention to such important priorities as political reconciliation and economic recovery. In the consultations, China proposed appropriate adjustments to the draft resolution. It is our hope that MINUSTAH will abide by the established principles and practices of United Nations peacekeeping operations and that the Haitian Government will continue to tirelessly promote political dialogue and reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">The Security Council, in operative paragraph 3 of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1608(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1608 (2005)</a>, decided on a temporarily increase in the military and police components of MINUSTAH for the elections in Haiti and requested the Secretary-General to devise, in a timely manner, a progressive drawdown strategy of the MINUSTAH force levels for the post-election period. We believe that, with the conclusion of the electoral cycle, timely implementation of that provision will enhance the effectiveness of the limited resources of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa09">We have noted that, although some amendments proposed by the Chinese delegation were incorporated into the resolution, a number of important elements were not reflected in the text. That leaves the resolution not as balanced and comprehensive as we had hoped. Bearing fully in mind the strong wishes of the sponsors, China, in order to show the maximum flexibility, agreed to put aside a number of pending issues and did its best to facilitate consensus. We hope that, when the Security Council next revisits this issue, those insufficiencies will be fully addressed in considering a renewal of MINUSTAH's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa10"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1743(2007).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1743 (2007)</a>, unanimously adopted a few minutes ago, demonstrates once again the long-term commitment and vision of the United Nations with regard to Haiti. China is prepared to work with others to ensure that the Organization adapts itself to changing realities in its endeavour to assist the Haitian people in reassuming ownership over their own country.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="nation">Panama</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">Panama is taking the floor, first, to place clearly on record the importance of the situation in Haiti for our country. Secondly, we wish to thank the countries of the region that have devoted efforts and contributed troops to Haiti -- including Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile, Ecuador and Guatemala -- and, in particular, the countries outside the region that are doing so, including Sri Lanka, Nepal and Jordan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">Panama also wishes to express its appreciation for the efforts made by the delegation of Peru and Ambassador Voto-Bernales in the process of negotiating this resolution on Haiti. I believe that the document finally adopted will make an important contribution to the development and pacification processes in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Panama regrets that the extension provided for in the resolution was for only eight months, when the Secretary-General, the Group of Friends of Haiti and Haiti itself were hoping that the extension would be for 12 months. In the view of Panama, 12 months should have been allocated to a comprehensive assessment of Haiti's development. Haiti will need not only internal management by Haitians of their political and economic processes -- which is paramount -- but also the support of the United Nations and the countries of the region. Such support will have to continue not only for 12 months, but for many more. During that period, I am confident that the actions of the Government of Haiti will make progress in such a way as to enable the Security Council to change the Mission's configuration in keeping with that progress.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">I would like to give one clear example. I hope that over the coming months or years we will be able to reduce the number of military personnel and increase the number of police and to reduce the number of security personnel and increase the number of personnel who have more to do with institution-building. I also trust that at some point during that phase the Peacebuilding Commission will step in to assist Haiti with its development, and that soon afterwards the Security Council will be able to complete its tasks there.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">In that regard, however, it seems to us that it would have been appropriate to extend the mandate for 12 months -- particularly given what Ambassador Voto-Bernales was able to achieve in the negotiations regarding commitments vis-à-vis the Government of Haiti with respect to development and institution-building.</p>
