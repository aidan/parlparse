	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">In connection with this election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the members of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">First, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 264 (III) of 8 October 1948, a State which is a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice but not a Member of the United Nations shall participate in the General Assembly in electing the members of the Court in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. On this occasion I am happy to welcome here the representatives of Nauru and Switzerland.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">Secondly, I should like to confirm that at this time the Security Council, independently of the General Assembly, is also proceeding to elect one member of the Court. This procedure is in accordance with Article 8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">"The General Assembly and the Security Council shall proceed independently of one another to elect the members of the Court."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa06">Accordingly, the results of the voting in the General Assembly will not be communicated to the Security Council until one candidate has obtained the required majority in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa07">Thirdly, I should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The Assembly has before it <a href="../pdf/A-49-827.pdf" class="pdf">document A/49/827</a>, which contains a memorandum by the Secretary-General on the present composition of the Court and the procedure to be followed in the General Assembly and in the Security Council with regard to the election; documents <a href="../pdf/A-49-828.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/828</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-49-828-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/828/Add.1</a>, which contain the name of the candidate who has been nominated by national groups within the required time for submission, that is, by 10 January 1995; <a href="../pdf/A-49-837.pdf" class="nolink">document A/49/837</a>, providing information concerning nominations received from national groups after 10 January 1995; and <a href="../pdf/A-49-829.pdf" class="pdf">document A/49/829</a>, which contains the curriculum vitae of the candidate nominated by national groups.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa08">In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected. For the present election, 94 votes constitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly. If on the first ballot no candidate obtains an absolute majority, it will be necessary to proceed to other ballots until a candidate has obtained that majority.</p>
