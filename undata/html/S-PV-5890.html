	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2008-39.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2008/39</a>, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council recalls the statement by its President of 21 February 2007 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-3.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/3</a>) and emphasizes that security sector reform is an essential element of any stabilization and reconstruction process in post-conflict environments. The Security Council recognizes that the establishment of an effective, professional and accountable security sector is one of the necessary elements for laying the foundations for peace and sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's efforts on security sector reform and takes note of his report entitled 'Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform' of 23 January 2008 (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-39.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/39</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council commends Slovakia and South Africa for their joint initiative in holding the International Workshop on Enhancing United Nations Support for Security Sector Reform in Africa on 7-8 November 2007 and takes note of the letter dated 20 November 2007 from the Permanent Representatives of Slovakia and South Africa (<a href="../pdf/S-2007-687.pdf" class="pdf">S/2007/687</a>). The Security Council encourages further similar activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council recognizes that security sector reform is a long-term process and reiterates that it is the sovereign right and primary responsibility of the country concerned to determine its national approach and priorities for security sector reform. It should be a nationally owned process that is rooted in the particular needs and conditions of the country in question. The Security Council underlines that the strong support of the United Nations and international community is also critical in strengthening national capacities thereby reinforcing national ownership, which is crucial for the sustainability of the process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council recognizes the important role that the United Nations has played in supporting national security sector reform efforts and underlines the need for its continued engagement. In this regard, the Security Council emphasizes the need to develop a holistic and coherent United Nations approach to security sector reform as recommended by the Secretary-General, in close consultation with Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council underlines that United Nations support to security sector reform must take place within a broad framework of the rule of law and should contribute to the overall strengthening of the United Nations rule of law activities as well as wider reconstruction and development efforts. This will require coordination with all relevant United Nations actors, in particular the Rule of Law Coordination and Resource Group, to ensure coherence of approach.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council emphasizes the important role that the Peacebuilding Commission, through its integrated peacebuilding strategies, can play in ensuring continuous international support to countries emerging from conflict. The Security Council also recognizes the importance of continued close cooperation and partnerships with non-United Nations actors, in particular regional, subregional and other intergovernmental organizations, including international financial institutions and bilateral donors, as well as non-governmental organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to include, wherever appropriate, recommendations related to security sector reform in his periodic reports on United Nations operations mandated by the Security Council."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-14.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/14</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
