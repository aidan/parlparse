<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Maitland</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa01">It is an honour for me to present to the General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-56-551.pdf" class="pdf">document A/56/551</a>/Add.l, which contains the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (the Fourth Committee) covering a comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects, under item 89 of the Assembly's agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa02">As those present may recall, my previous appearance before this body, on 10 December last, was for the purpose of introducing all the other reports of the Fourth Committee on agenda items 85 through 94, as well as items 12 and 18. Those reports, contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-56-547.pdf" class="pdf">A/56/547</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-56-557.pdf" class="pdf">A/56/557</a>, included the texts of draft resolutions and decisions recommended to the General Assembly for adoption. With the presentation today of <a href="../pdf/A-56-551.pdf" class="pdf">A/56/551</a>/Add.l, which recommends the draft resolution on item 89 to the General Assembly by the Fourth Committee, the reporting obligations of the Fourth Committee for and to this session are fulfilled.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">In its operative paragraphs, the draft resolution proposed by the Fourth Committee in <a href="../pdf/A-56-551-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/56/551/Add.1</a> welcomes the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations; endorses the proposals, recommendations and conclusions contained in that report; urges Member States to take all necessary steps to implement them; reiterates the conditions under which personnel-contributing countries may become members of the Special Committee; decides that the Special Committee shall continue its efforts; and requests it to submit a report on its work to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa04">In the course of its 20th to 22nd meetings, held during the first part of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and in its resumed session on 26 April 2002, the Fourth Committee examined agenda item 89 from a number of different perspectives. These began with a comprehensive introductory statement by the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations and a general debate under this item. They continued with an informal interactive meeting covering the comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects. They also included informal interactive discussions in the Committee with the Under-Secretary-General and other senior officials of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa05">Subsequently, in April 2002, the Special Political and Decolonization Committee again took up this agenda item to examine the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations and to approve a draft resolution endorsing it. Today, those labours result in the report that those present see before them, which I now have the honour to present to the General Assembly for its approval.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">In so doing, I would be remiss were I to fail to acknowledge those whose efforts have been particularly vital in bringing it to fruition: the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, its Bureau and those delegations that coordinated the draft resolutions adopted by it; the Chairman of the Fourth Committee, Ambassador Hasmy Agam of Malaysia and Vice-Chairpersons Ms. Anna-Maija Korpi of Finland, Mrs. Alexandrina Rusu of Romania and Mr. Cristián Streeter of Chile. I should also like to express appreciation to the Under-Secretary-General of the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, Mr. Chen Jian; the Secretary of the Committee, Ms. Lesley Wilkinson, and her very competent team from the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa07">The document before us is a testament to the diligence and dedication that each and all of them have brought to this endeavour. With that in mind, it is my particular pleasure to submit to the General Assembly for its consideration and adoption the recommendations of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee contained in <a href="../pdf/A-56-551-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/56/551/Add.1</a>, covering a comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects.</p>
