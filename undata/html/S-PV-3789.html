	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council takes note of the letters from the Executive Chairman of the Special Commission dated 9 and 11 June 1997 (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-455.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/455</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1997-458.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/458</a>), the letter from the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq dated 5 June 1997 (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-456.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/456</a>) and the letter from the Under-Secretary of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Iraq dated 6 June 1997 (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-457.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/457</a>). The Council expresses serious concern at the four incidents on 4, 5 and 7 June 1997 in which Iraqi personnel unacceptably interfered with helicopter flights operating in support of inspection of sites designated by the Special Commission under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 687 (1991)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-707(1991).pdf" class="pdf">707 (1991)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-715(1991).pdf" class="pdf">715 (1991)</a>, endangering the helicopters and their crews, as well as persons on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council deplores these incidents and underlines that Iraq must immediately take effective steps to put an end to all such actions. The Council reminds Iraq of its obligations under the relevant resolutions of the Council, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1060(1996).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1060 (1996)</a>. The Council affirms that Iraq is obliged to ensure the security of the personnel of the Special Commission and to permit the Commission to carry out its air operations anywhere in Iraq without interference of any kind in accordance with pertinent provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-707(1991).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 707 (1991)</a>. The Council recalls the commitments contained in the joint statement of the Special Commission and Iraq of 22 June 1996.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its continuing support to the Special Commission in its efforts to ensure the implementation of its mandate under the relevant resolutions of the Council".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-33.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/33</a>.</p>
