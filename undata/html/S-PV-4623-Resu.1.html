	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Pakistan in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Cameroon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">Cameroon associates itself with the statement to be made later in the debate by the Republic of the Congo on behalf of the 11 States members of the Economic Community of Central African States. I should like, however, to make several observations in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa03">I should like thank the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, for his excellent introduction of the report of the Secretary-General on small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa04">Cameroon has good reason to be interested in the proliferation of illicit small arms, because it is located in one of the regions that are probably most affected by this scourge. This is not the first time that the Security Council has taken up the issue of small arms and light weapons. Because of the threat that the proliferation of and illicit trade in small arms poses to international peace and security, the Council has been actively seized of the matter since 1998 and has been considering it regularly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa05">Today's debate, based on the Secretary-General's report, is a continuation of the work being done by the Council. It offers us another opportunity not only to further refine measures already recognized to combat this worldwide scourge, but also to explore new approaches and solutions. In the opinion of my delegation, the Programme of Action adopted by consensus by the United Nations Conference on Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons In All Its Aspects, held from 9 to 20 July 2001, offers an appropriate context for international action and for strengthening the Security Council's actions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa06">Recourse to sanctions, particularly arms embargoes in areas affected by conflict, is still the preferred instrument for action by the Security Council. However, looking at the experience of existing sanction regimes, we see that the effectiveness of strict implementation of arms embargoes depends, to a large extent, on the cooperation of many players at the national, regional and international levels. Their role is a crucial one if we want regular, reliable and useful information about trafficking networks, and if we want to monitor them effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa07">At this point, I would like to stress the decisive part played by States. Above and beyond the national measures that need to be taken to contribute to implementation of the embargoes imposed by the Security Council, States must regulate the entire arms sector in order to control, depending on their peculiar situation, the movement of small arms. That is why we support the efforts to encourage the drafting of an international instrument on international arms transfers, including tracing.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa08">All efforts to control illicit flows of small arms, particularly in Africa, will be futile without such measures. The approach based on a moratorium on arms imports comes up against this constraint. Such a moratorium is not a panacea that can apply to all affected regions of the world. Each region is different.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa09">Given its powers, the Council becomes answerable if it refrains from taking the necessary steps against the States which deliberately violate arms embargoes or contribute to violations by the way they conduct themselves. The Council cannot impose embargoes while at the same time it chooses to ignore those other than the targeted State who are guilty of violating the embargoes. Likewise, the Council must also look into the sources of the illicit trade in small arms in violation of its embargoes whether it be related to the illegal exploitation of natural resources, drug trafficking or simply international criminal networks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa10">As far as Cameroon is concerned, the actions of the various bodies of the United Nations -- each within its own field of competence, of course -- on the question of small arms are complementary and must lead to a coherent overall strategy. This is why we encourage the Council, where appropriate, to include in the mandates of peacekeeping operations activities for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants and for the collection and destruction of weapons. We also believe that the Council should provide adequate financing for that purpose.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa11">We fully endorse the relevant recommendations made in the Secretary-General's report. They will be a useful supplement to the measures already advocated and will certainly help to stop those interests that are particularly sensitive, sometimes profit-oriented and often criminal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa12">Views expressed during this debate complement others in the report of the Secretary-General. Naturally, they will be used to enhance the draft presidential statement that will be presented in the next few days to the Council members, once completed by our experts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa13">I now resume my function as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa14">The next speaker on my list is the representative of the Republic of Korea. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lee Ho-jin</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">My delegation appreciates the convening of this open meeting on the question of small arms as one more step to further enhance efficiency of the work of the Security Council. We also thank Under-Secretary-General Dhanapala for the excellent introduction to the Secretary-General's report on the subject.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">In substance, the subject we are dealing with is an important issue with many challenges involving security, humanitarian and development dimensions.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">As noted in the presidential statement of the Security Council of 31 August 2001, the accumulation of small arms</p>
	<blockquote id="pg003-bk01-pa04">"compromises the effectiveness of the Security Council in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-21.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/21</a></i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">Indeed, the destabilizing accumulation and illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons pose major security concerns for the entire international community, as reflected by the startling statistics on this problem. Every year, the misuse of small arms and light weapons has led to the loss of 500,000 lives, the majority of them being civilians, including women and children. Additionally, recent developments have highlighted the further danger posed by the likelihood of the use of small arms by terrorists and non-State actors.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">The momentum generated by the Programme of Action adopted last year at the United Nations Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons is now having an impact at national, regional and global levels. As underscored by the Security Council, the Programme's success depends largely on the political will of the international community. Hence, sustained and concerted global action is vital in addressing the problems posed by the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons. Accordingly, the Security Council should continue to play a constructive role in promoting the implementation of the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">There are many complexities stemming from the proliferation of small arms in post-conflict situations. Of particular concern is the recurring pattern of violence and instability. Therefore, there is a compelling need for the Security Council, in carrying out its peace-building activities, to include specific considerations for small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">My delegation regards the 12 recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1053</a>) as valuable input for future action by the Security Council. We should like to identify areas within the report as a basis for our deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">Given that the proliferation of small arms gives rise not only to the outbreak of violence but also to the exacerbation, prolongation and perpetuation of conflict, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes are crucial for consolidating peace and for promoting an environment for sustainable development. As reflected by the growing number of casualties, the availability of weapons in conflict-ridden areas is a great threat to the safety and security of United Nations peacekeepers. The implementation of more effective DDR programmes within the Security Council's conflict prevention and post-conflict peace-building efforts will help to ensure the safety of all civilians in areas of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">The Security Council has rightly stressed the need to incorporate relevant provision for DDR programmes into the mandates and budgets of all peacekeeping operations. It is noteworthy that various United Nations peacekeeping operations -- particularly those in Africa -- now include a disarmament component aimed at collecting and disarming these types of weapons. As we said at a previous open meeting, the Security Council is fully equipped to integrate the recommendations concerning DDR into its future peacekeeping activities as a core element.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa11">With regard to the question of embargoes, the lessons learned from the past have shown that weapons embargoes alone are not sufficient. In the view of my delegation, sanctions should be fine-tuned to effectively target a region or specific countries to achieve a greater degree of success. We agree on the need for the Security Council to study further ways and means to improve its efficiency on a case-by-case basis. My delegation welcomes the recommendations calling for the vigorous and expeditious use of arms embargoes by the Council. In addition, we would like to see the Council pursue the use of monitoring mechanisms, in accordance with Article 41 of the Charter, with a view to ensuring successful enforcement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa12">My delegation agrees with the Secretary-General's recommendation that the Security Council should call on Member States to establish and implement legislation or measures to regulate the movement of small arms and light weapons. In particular, we welcome the Council's efforts to encourage all Member States that have not already done so to adopt and enforce stringent regulations with regard to export control.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa13">Once again, the Security Council should maintain its attention and its active engagement with regard to curbing the proliferation and illicit trade of small arms and light weapons. The Republic of Korea would like to assure members of its unswerving support for the Council's initiatives in that field.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Egypt. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aboul Gheit</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Allow me, Mr. President, to express to you and to your friendly country, Cameroon, our sincere thanks and appreciation. We are pleased to take part in this meeting under your presidency to discuss an issue of such great importance to the African continent -- an issue that threatens its children, hundreds of thousands of whose lives are claimed each year in wars and conflicts as a result of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The effectiveness and the credibility of the Security Council are derived not only from its being the mechanism that was chosen by the entire world more than half a century ago to maintain international peace and security, but also from its ability to address new challenges to peace and security, to respond to them and to develop procedures to confront them. The Council has become aware of the danger posed in recent years by the illicit proliferation of and trafficking in small arms and light weapons, of their impact on humanity and of the urgent need to face this challenge seriously and effectively, in a manner commensurate with the danger.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">As the Council has considered the changes and planned its activities accordingly, the General Assembly has taken concrete steps to consider the legal and political aspects of the issue of small arms and light weapons and the dangers that they pose. The Assembly has done that through the creation of more than one panel of experts, the holding of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all Its Aspects, and the adoption there of an ambitious Programme of Action that we should make every effort to implement over the next four years.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">I should like to express my delegation's appreciation for the valuable report of the Secretary-General on small arms (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1053</a>) and for the recommendations that it contains. On behalf of the Egyptian delegation, I should like to make a few remarks on the issue now before the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">First, the fact that hundreds of thousands of people fall victim each year to small arms and light weapons clearly makes it necessary for the Security Council to address the issue of the proliferation of such weapons within the framework of its main responsibility: the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Secondly, the new measures adopted in that regard by the Council over the past few years -- such as the establishment of independent panels of experts and of monitoring mechanisms for implementing arms embargoes -- have had limited success in dealing with the illicit trade in and the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. That limited success can be attributed in some cases to the practical difficulties of accurately monitoring arms exports and to an absence in the Council of the political will to enforce certain embargoes and to verify their implementation -- as had been the case with regard to Somalia for the past 10 years, until the Council finally took measures to ensure the implementation of the arms embargo imposed against that country under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-733(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 733 (1992)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Thirdly, the Egyptian delegation endorses the Secretary-General's recommendation that the exchange of information between the Security Council and the General Assembly be improved in order to bring about better coordination between the strategies of the two bodies in the field of small arms and light weapons, giving due consideration to the differences between the role and mandate of the Council, on the one hand, and the more comprehensive role played by the Assembly, on the other.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aboul Gheit</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">Fourthly, there is no doubt that, in addition to the adoption of specific measures to deal with the excess of small arms and light weapons and their destruction, the Security Council should include in the mandates of peacekeeping operations clear provisions with regard to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration into civilian life of former combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Egypt recommends that the committee on peacekeeping operations of the General Assembly should look into the possibility of promoting the United Nation's role in the DDR programmes and in financing activities through the budgets of peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">In conclusion, the delegation of Egypt fully endorses the Secretary-General's recommendation urging the Security Council to give more attention to the implementation of arms embargoes and arms exports to regions and countries that face armed conflicts or are actually undergoing them, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of The United Nations. It should also consider the possibility of adopting certain measures against countries that deliberately violate Security Council resolutions on arms embargoes.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The Security Council has an important role to play in the field of small arms and light weapons, in light of its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter of the United Nations. While we stress the responsibility of the Security Council in this regard, we would like to draw attention, once again, to the natural right of States, individually or collectively, to self-defence, and to the right to self-determination for all peoples, particularly those under foreign occupation.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Ukraine. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa01">I wish to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to you for holding this important public debate on the question of small arms. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive, substantive and timely report on this issue and Under-Secretary-General Mr. Dhanapala for his presentation of this important document.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa02">The illicit trafficking and accumulation of small arms remain among the greatest impediments to sustainable development, conflict prevention and resolution and post-conflict peace-building. They pose a serious threat to human security and human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa03">Ukraine has continuously expressed its concern about the serious humanitarian consequences of this phenomenon, which claimed hundreds of thousands of innocent lives all over the world, thus highlighting a global dimension of this problem. We are deeply convinced that without concerted efforts by the international community to prevent uncontrolled proliferation of these weapons it is impossible to maintain peace, regional security and global security. The necessity of this has become even more acute and urgent after the tragic events of 11 September.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa04">The Programme of Action adopted by the 2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects has been a significant but perhaps only a first step towards the goal of controlling this scourge. We hope that within the follow-up process at global, regional and national levels it will be possible to make the implementation of the Programme of Action more efficient as well as to find ways to strengthen and further develop the measures contained therein.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa05">In our view, it is essential to provide for global and regional coordination between national control systems and mechanisms for preventing illicit small arms and light weapons trade operations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa06">The responsibility for establishing control over the traffic in small arms and light weapons rests with the States acquiring those weapons. At the same time those States should be encouraged to improve their abilities to curb the illicit traffic in small arms. That might require financial assistance from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa07">Ukraine welcomes the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General and is looking forward to the results of work of the Group of Governmental Experts on the marking and tracing of small arms. We hope that the findings of the Group will lay the groundwork for the development of an international instrument, open to all, which will increase the national capacity of States to identify and trace, in a timely and reliable manner, small arms and light weapons, as well as to seize those of an illicit nature.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa08">Preventing, combating and eliminating the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons is one of the important issues the Security Council must deal with as part of its primary responsibility for maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa09">It is evident that promoting long-term conditions for development and security is not possible without resolving ongoing conflicts and taking adequate measures to ensure stability in post-conflict situations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa10">Excessive accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons fuel, intensify and delay the resolution of conflicts. We note that a series of innovative measures, taken by the Security Council, to enhance compliance with arms embargoes by establishing independent panels of experts and monitoring mechanisms resulted in positive outcomes, especially in Angola and in Sierra Leone. At the same time the problem of illicit trafficking persists in some other areas of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa11">We believe that at this stage it is important to review the lessons learned in order to ensure the efficiency of measures that could be further taken by the Council. In this connection it will be useful, in our view, to focus on financial sources used for purchase of illegal weapons and to address the relationship between the illicit exploitation of natural and other resources and the purchase of and trade in illegal arms. It would also be important to define the role the relevant international organizations, business and financial institutions and other actors at the international, regional and local levels can play in the implementation of arms embargoes.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa12">We share the view expressed in the report of the Secretary-General that arms embargoes help to stop arms flows into targeted countries and to rebel groups, but do not eliminate small arms and light weapons that already exist in areas of conflict. The effective functioning of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes for former combatants and the implementation of projects aimed at collecting and destroying illegal weapons are of considerable importance to the successful implementation of measures taken by the Security Council to redress the situation in a specific country-related context.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa13">We therefore welcome the observations made and the 12 recommendations proposed by the Secretary-General, and we look forward to a further update on the issue of small arms and their impact on post-conflict peace-building, human security and human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa14">I should like to stress the fact that Ukraine conducts a responsible policy in the field of arms control. Ukrainian legislation envisages strict measures to prevent the illegal manufacturing, possession and trafficking of all types of armaments, including small arms and light weapons. The national export-control system provides for effective export and import licensing procedures. Efforts are also being made to improve national legislation in this field. One of the most recent steps was the adoption by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of an action plan to implement the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, as well as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa15">Finally, let me assure the Council that Ukraine will continue to take an active part in international efforts to combat the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons and to restrain their uncontrolled proliferation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Acuña Pimentel</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">My delegation welcomes the opportunity of this public debate on a subject that, as we all know, is related to issues that are a source of deep concern to the international community, not only in the humanitarian, security, disarmament and development fields, but also in the field of prevention of international crime, including drug trafficking, terrorism and human security.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">I am grateful also to the Secretary-General for his report on this important question, and we deem the 12 recommendations therein of particular interest.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">As has been repeatedly stated with concern in various specialized reports on small arms and light weapons -- reports with recognized academic credibility -- for many years now the world has been witness to the phenomenon of the excessive accumulation and illicit traffic in this type of arms. This accumulation is destabilizing and to a large extent the result of illicit trading, to the point where this category of arms is today considered to be one of the principal scourges causing the death of civilians throughout the world, particularly children and women. It also perpetuates, and is one of the underlying causes of, poverty and the domestic and international conflicts that affect or hinder the development of countries.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">This was recognized by the Secretary-General in the report he submitted to the Security Council on the subject, in which he states that preventing, combating and eliminating the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons constitutes one of the key tasks of the Security Council in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, which was held in July 2001, and its conclusions represent an important milestone in the humanitarian field and in the fields of disarmament and human security. At that Conference, Chile stressed the need for the Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons to include a set of clear and effective measures to promote respect for, and the protection of, human life as a fundamental value, over and above the commercial interests associated with this category of arms. This is the approach that Chilean domestic law has adopted on the subject.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Chile firmly supports the Programme of Action adopted by the Conference. To that end, it sponsored in November last year, jointly with the Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the first regional expert workshop to examine and propose measures for the evaluation of, and follow-up to, the aforementioned Conference. This initiative is in addition to other important initiatives taken by our region, such as the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials, and the Working Group on this type of arms of MERCOSUR, Bolivia and Chile. All of these activities aim to intensify the efforts of our countries to combat this serious problem in a coordinated manner.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">From a global perspective, the Security Council over the years has put in place a considerable number of mechanisms to avert, at least to some extent, the catastrophic consequences of the excessive accumulation of, and illicit trafficking in, small arms and light weapons, including the imposition of embargoes on territories in situations of conflict and, in cases of conflict prevention, the undertaking of peacekeeping operations and peace-building activities.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Over time, the efforts made to operationalize the wide range of measures in these various cases have created a rich store of specialized knowledge that can be used to formulate principles, norms and measures to combat this phenomenon in a more rational and effective manner, even though -- as the Secretary-General indicated in his report -- there are many regions and cases in which it is not possible to prevent and eliminate illicit trafficking.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">The Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons contains important provisions falling within the purview of the Security Council, for example, those on the effective implementation of embargoes and those on the inclusion in the activities of peacekeeping operations of adequate provisions in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">Against this backdrop and based on the Secretariat's experience, the Secretary-General has formulated a set of 12 recommendations in his report which my delegation considers to be a valuable contribution to the Council's work. Most of these have already been implemented, at least to some extent, or are related to initiatives that have been proposed by experts and Governments, but that are still the subject of debate and have yet to be translated into action.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">The systematic review by the Council of these 12 recommendations, with the assistance of the Secretariat, could, in our view, be useful in the formulation of a methodology that could be used to take up, with the renewed determination that the situation requires, the task of implementing more effective measures to overcome the serious problems posed by small arms and light weapons.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Manalo</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">First of all, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month. We also congratulate Bulgaria on its presidency last month. We further wish to thank Under-Secretary-General Dhanapala for his presentation this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">Mr. President, I wish to express my delegation's appreciation for your having convened this very important meeting. The proliferation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons pose a serious threat to peace, safety and security and disrupt sustainable economic growth and social development. The excessive accumulation and unregulated distribution of firearms further aggravate conflicts. My country has experienced terrorism and the consequent loss and displacement of innocent civilians and the commission of heinous crimes due to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">In this regard, the Philippines notes that the report of the Secretary-General on small arms presents not only the recent initiatives of the Council but also recommendations and observations regarding an expanded role for the Council in its two primary tasks: arms embargoes, and the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants. The recommendations are noteworthy and would serve well in the development of both short-term and long-term strategies to counter the dangers that the proliferation of small arms and light weapons poses to peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">With regard to DDR, my delegation maintains its view that this should not be merely a post-conflict peace-building measure. With respect to low-intensity, long-running conflicts, this practice may not be very effective and could even be counter-productive as combatants turn to crime, piracy, acts of terrorism or other similar activities. Combatants, therefore, should have a viable and practical opportunity to remove themselves from an ongoing conflict and for their small arms to be collected. The availability of DDR before conflict ceases may in fact hasten the resolution of conflict. My delegation is gratified that this element has been incorporated in the United Nations Programme of Action, and we welcome the recommendation contained in the Secretary-General's report to include it in the mandates of United Nations peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">As part of a long-term strategy, the Philippines strongly supports the decisions adopted by the Security Council in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1314(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1314 (2000)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1379(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1379 (2001)</a>, relating to the protection of children in armed conflict. In recognition of the humanitarian costs and consequences of small arms proliferation and abuse, the Philippines is undertaking a comprehensive programme for children in armed conflict, with three components -- prevention; advocacy and mobilization to save our children; and rescue, rehabilitation and reintegration. Measures for prevention are approached through livelihood programmes, educational assistance, health care and nutrition services, food security and the provision of basic facilities and infrastructure.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">Of the total recorded crimes committed with firearms in the Philippines last year, 85 per cent were committed with unlicensed or illegally possessed firearms. The Programme of Action adopted by the Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons is, therefore, a major step in the right direction in addressing this problem. The statement issued by the Security Council President on 31 August last year called on all Member States to take required measures to implement the recommendations contained therein. The Philippines has undertaken initiatives to implement the United Nations Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">The Philippines hosted a regional seminar on implementing the United Nations Programme of Action in July 2002, co-sponsored by Canada. Delegates from eight member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and from Australia, China, Japan and Republic of Korea, together with representatives from civil society and the arms industry, participated in this seminar. Observers from some European Union countries and the United States of America also participated.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">This seminar aimed to promote awareness of the United Nations Programme of Action in Small Arms and Light Weapons at the regional level. The discussions focused on capacity- building, training in law enforcement, customs and airport control, collection and destruction programmes and DDR.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">The report of the seminar Co-Chairmen concluded that developing a regional arrangement to deal with the problems of illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is crucial, and it proposed that the following principles be taken into consideration. First, there should be respect for and commitment to international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Secondly, such an arrangement should be balanced, realistic and implementable, with the primary objective of ensuring that arms transfers are made solely by States. Thirdly, such arrangement should take into account the right of each State to manufacture, import and retain small arms and light weapons for its self-defence and security needs. Fourthly, such arrangement should take into account the role played by civil society in raising awareness of the danger associated with the illicit trade in and uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">Simultaneously with this seminar, a symbolic arms destruction ceremony was held to coincide with the first anniversary of the 2001 United Nations Conference. More than 1,000 confiscated, seized and surplus small arms and light weapons were destroyed during the ceremony.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">Finally, my delegation appreciates the political impetus that the Security Council has given to the issue of small arms and light weapons. We believe this reflects recognition that the proliferation and abuse of small arms and light weapons is a threat to international peace and security.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of the Philippines for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Australia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tesch</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, the Australian delegation is pleased to see you in the chair and is very grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly on this very important matter. We also thank Under-Secretary-General Dhanapala for his introduction of the Secretary-General's report on small arms, which we consider very important and timely contribution to international efforts to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">The report usefully identifies ways in which the Security Council, in fulfilling its role in maintaining international peace and security, can help to control and eradicate the illicit small arms trade, building on the 2001 United Nations Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">All of the report's recommendations are important, but some stand out for Australia as being of particular merit. Reflecting our extensive experience in dealing with post-conflict situations in the South and South West Pacific, Australia strongly endorses recommendations 7 and 8, encouraging the inclusion of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) activities in Council mandates and budgets for peacekeeping operations. We also strongly endorse recommendations 5 and 11, calling for the strict enforcement of all Council resolutions on sanctions, including those imposing arms embargoes, and for effective monitoring mechanisms to oversee the rigorous and effective application of embargoes. It is in these two areas in particular -- inclusion of DDR activities in peacekeeping mandates and rigid enforcement of arms embargoes -- that the Council can make a practical and positive impact on international efforts to combat the illicit small arms trade.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">Australia also commends the report's recognition of the important role of strengthened national export control measures in ensuring effective regulation of small arms exports. Effective national export controls, including end-use certification, are the first line of defence against illicit transfers and help to prevent exports that may start out as licit ending up in the wrong hands.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">While the role of the Council is important, the prime responsibility for combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons lies with Member States. The 2001 United Nations Programme of Action provides a comprehensive and dynamic framework for Member States to follow in combating the illicit small arms trade at the national, regional and international levels.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">Good progress has been made in promoting regional-level cooperation in particular, as indeed we have heard from a number of speakers today. The provision of capacity-building assistance to States with development needs is an important means of enhancing regional cooperation. Australia is strongly committed to continuing to assist countries in the South Pacific region to combat the problems posed by small arms, through the institution of better governance and accountability. We have been actively involved in small arms disposal processes in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, as an element of broader peace-building efforts there. Australia is also working closely with Japan to organize a second small arms workshop for Pacific Island countries, following a successful inaugural workshop we hosted in 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">In the lead-up to the biennial meeting on small arms in mid-2003, Australia urges Member States to renew their efforts to implement the United Nations Programme of Action. We must maintain a strong collective resolve to address effectively the humanitarian and security dimensions of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, as identified in the Secretary-General's report.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Australia for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Japan. I invite her to take a seat at the Council table and to make her statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Inoguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">At the outset, as the Permanent Representative and head of the delegation of Japan to the Conference on Disarmament at Geneva, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you, Mr. President, on behalf of my Government, for inviting us to participate in the Security Council's deliberations on the issue of small arms, an increasingly important item on the disarmament agenda. It is my great honour to address this body, which has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. I would also like to express my utmost appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and to Under-Secretary-General Jayantha Dhanapala and his office for issuing a substantive and comprehensive report on this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">Numbers speak for themselves. Small arms and light weapons kill more than 500,000 people every year. The excessive accumulation of such weapons is a particularly dangerous destabilizing factor in post-conflict situations, as it disrupts humanitarian aid operations and hinders rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. The excessive accumulation of such weapons can also rekindle conflicts and thus undermine efforts for peace and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">The events of 11 September 2001 showed another dimension of the issue of small arms. Those are the weapons that various terrorist groups around the world use most frequently. The elimination of the supply of weapons, including small arms, to terrorists, as called for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, is an essential element in the global fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The problems of small arms and light weapons are multidimensional and interlinked. I cannot fail to note that there is also a gender element involved. One of the extraordinary aspects of contemporary wars and conflicts is the large proportion of non-combatants among the victims. As a matter of fact, the greatest number of conflict-related deaths of women and children are caused by small arms. Restraining and curbing the problems of small arms and light weapons is a matter of urgent priority for the entire international community.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">The United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held in July 2001, adopted a Programme of Action that represents the collective will of the international community to address these problems. That outcome of the Conference was further consolidated with the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-24.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 56/24</a> V, on small arms and light weapons, the draft of which was submitted jointly by Colombia, South Africa and Japan in October 2001. That resolution called upon all States to implement the Programme of Action and decided to convene a conference, no later than 2006, to review progress made in its implementation. The consensus adoption of that important resolution demonstrates global solidarity in addressing the issue of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">The resolution also decided to hold biennial meetings of States, the first of which will take place next year. The purpose of that meeting is to provide an opportunity for States and other international actors, including non-governmental organizations, to share experiences and lessons learned in the implementation of the Programme of Action. Such exchanges will allow them to address their problems more effectively and efficiently.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">Japan, as a country steadfastly committed to tackling the issue of small arms, attaches great importance to the global implementation of the Programme of Action. In January we organized a meeting to follow up on the United Nations Conference. We are also planning to hold a seminar with the participation of Pacific countries to facilitate their implementation of the Programme of Action. I would like to take this opportunity to remind all delegations that, since Japan would like to play a meaningful, if modest, role at the 2003 meeting, it has already announced its candidacy for the chairmanship of that meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">The Programme of Action comprises two categories of measures: prevention of the excessive accumulation of small arms and the reduction of such accumulations. With regard to prevention, a Group of Governmental Experts has been established to examine the feasibility of developing an international instrument to enable States to identify, trace and disrupt illegal supply lines. The report of the Secretary-General calls upon Member States to support such meaningful exercises. As a member of that Group, Japan will continue to actively contribute to it.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">The Programme of Action also calls for the effective implementation of arms embargoes decided by the Security Council. Monitoring arrangements are also in place to ensure the effective enforcement of embargoes. Japan supports the recommendation of the report of the Secretary-General that the use of a combination of those measures should be further enhanced.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">With regard to the reduction of excessive accumulations of small arms and light weapons, the Programme of Action stresses the importance of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants. In that regard, the Programme calls upon affected countries to develop DDR projects, while also calling for international assistance and cooperation in support of such projects. Further, the inclusion of DDR in the mandates of peacekeeping operations, where appropriate, deserves the serious attention of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">Japan will continue to implement appropriate weapons for development projects in cooperation with other Governments, international, regional and non-governmental organizations. Japan has also recently begun a joint research programme with the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research on arms collection projects in Albania, Cambodia, Congo, Mali and Papua New Guinea. That research will be completed no later than 2004, and we are confident that it will provide the international community with valuable lessons learned from the experiences of those affected countries.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa12">The role of the United Nations is increasingly important in following up last year's United Nations Conference. The Coordinating Action on Small Arms mechanism is already harmonizing the response of the United Nations. Japan commends the initiative taken by the Secretary-General in establishing the small arms advisory service, which will greatly enhance United Nations efforts in that area.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa13">I would like to touch upon the significant achievement of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms and the United Nations standardized instrument for reporting military expenditures. They are valuable international means for promoting transparency in armaments and international confidence-building. This year, the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is celebrating its tenth anniversary. Currently, 120 Governments are submitting their official data on the transfer of arms. In order to promote the universality of the Register, Japan has been co-organizing, with Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Nations, a series of regional workshops in several countries, including Ghana and Namibia. A similar seminar is planned to take place in Indonesia next February.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa14">The trust fund established in the Department for Disarmament Affairs has supported several United Nations activities, such as the study of the problems related to small arms and light weapons, public awareness programmes and the dispatch of fact-finding missions to affected countries. Japan has thus far contributed $2.16 million to the Fund.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa15">Finally, I would like to stress the importance of addressing the root causes of violence, armed conflicts, instability and other threats to international peace and security. In order to prevent the resurgence of conflicts and to foster durable peace and stability in post-conflict situations, it is important to accelerate the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants. But it is equally important to promote economic and social development, democratization and reconciliation among the parties to a conflict. That approach will help to ensure a fundamental, long-term and comprehensive solution to security problems in volatile areas. I believe that it is an approach the international community must take in order to consolidate peace and stability around the world in the twenty-first century.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ikouebe</span> <span class="nation">Congo</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the 11 countries members of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) -- Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda and Sao Tomé and Principe -- I would first like to express our pride in seeing you, Sir, presiding over the Security Council for this month. I would also like to thank you for including in the agenda of the Council the sensitive issue of small arms, which is at the heart of the greatest concerns of Central Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">For, as everyone knows, Central Africa has for some years faced a grave situation of armed conflict, destabilization and insecurity. It was not long ago that of the 11 members of ECCAS, seven were in a situation of war or instability. Simply consulting the agenda of the Security Council, one can see that the situation in Angola, Burundi, the Great Lakes, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic is routinely the subject of intense debates in the Chamber.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">It is therefore an opportunity for me to thank the Council for all the interest that it has constantly attached to the evolution of this highly sensitive geopolitical and security situation in the subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">But this is also an opportunity to announce to the entire international community that, for the first time in a long time, prospects for a return to peace are emerging today in the majority of the States concerned. The Security Council is therefore especially requested to take all the necessary measures to encourage, assist, accelerate and strengthen those positive developments in order to make the peace process irreversible. That is particularly the case with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the strengthening of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) is crucial.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">If I chose to refer to those situations, it was to underline that, as is often the case with conflicts in the Third World, the wars afflicting Central Africa are principally fuelled by light weapons, the subject of today's debate.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">To deal with this situation, the leaders of Central Africa have adopted an entire series of measures to build confidence among States, to prevent conflicts and to resolve them when they erupt. They have done so in order to establish lasting peace and security in a region which can offer a great deal more to Africa and the world.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">Therefore, numerous initiatives, recommendations and specific measures were adopted in the framework of ECCAS and through the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa, a working tool that the United Nations has put at our disposition to assist us in the highly sensitive domain of peace, security and preventive diplomacy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">In July 1999, at Yaoundé, Cameroon, there was a high-level subregional seminar on the examination and implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of lasting peace and development in Africa. At that seminar, the member countries of ECCAS adopted measures and recommended the implementation of the following mechanisms in the fight against the trafficking in and proliferation of small arms: the establishment of national commissions to combat the proliferation of light arms; approaching the Secretary-General of the United Nations to create an advisory mission on monitoring and collecting arms in the subregion of Central Africa; implementation of a community charter on investments foreseeing coercive measures in dealing with companies maintaining armed militias; the creation of a subregional register of conventional weapons; and a review and harmonization of national laws concerning carrying arms.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">Those measures and mechanisms were reaffirmed during the subregional conference on the proliferation and illicit circulation of small arms and light weapons in Central Africa, held in N'Djamena, Chad from 25 to 27 October 1999. During that conference, ECCAS member countries adopted the following recommendations: the harmonization of the national legislations of Central African States in the fight against the illicit proliferation and circulation of small arms and light weapons; the creation of a uniform arms register at the national and subregional levels and a databank on the existing stocks of each country, arms dealers and transport agents; a request for the Secretary-General's support of programmes for disarmament, demobilization and the reintegration of ex-combatants; a request for the assistance of the Secretary-General for the countries in the subregion in their efforts to restructure their armed forces and police; the examination of regional projects to collect arms, in cooperation with international institutions and financial backers, as well as small-scale development projects to promote the economic and social reintegration of those possessing illegal weapons of war; and the creation of a subregional office in Central Africa of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) and a more active cooperation between that body and the countries of Central Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Within the framework of the programme of work of the Advisory Committee during the period 2002 to 2003, the member countries of ECCAS also envisaged the organization of a subregional seminar on the implementation in Central Africa of the Programme of Action adopted at the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, which was held here last year.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Also foreseen is the organization of a workshop on the participation of ECCAS member States in the creation of a United Nations Conventional Arms Register and a United Nations register on military spending.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">As can be seen, the ECCAS member States are fully conscious of the real danger posed by small arms in an area that is attempting to end a very sad page in its history.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa13">Today, the presence on Angolan soil of thousands of anti-personnel mines is sufficient to remind us that the fight against that category of arms is a question of day-to-day survival for populations anxious to recover the happiness of a normal life.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa14">For the leaders of Central Africa, now that most of the States concerned can entertain real hopes for peace and security, the problem is finding the human, material and financial means to implement peace-building policies. Once all the peace agreements have been signed; once the foreign troops have withdrawn; and once national reconciliation has been achieved, we will have to support all these developments with measures to collect arms and to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate ex-combatants as soon as possible. The States members of ECCAS are committed to devoting a substantial share of their resources to such programmes. They expect the international community to assist them in establishing a definitive peace in their subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa15">In conclusion, I congratulate the Secretary-General on his excellent report on small arms, which Mr. Dhanapala introduced with great eloquence this morning, and assure him of the full cooperation of the countries of Central Africa in the implementation of its relevant recommendations, the majority of which mesh perfectly with the initiatives and actions undertaken by ECCAS.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Israel. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lancry</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I would like to commend the Secretary-General for his report on small arms and, in the same vein, to thank Under-Secretary-General Dhanapala for his remarkable introduction of the report this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">The State of Israel views the illicit trade and trafficking in small arms and light weapons first and foremost as a humanitarian issue. Such activity invariably leads to the loss of innocent life and affects the basic right of people to lead their lives peacefully, without fear of getting killed simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">The humanitarian dimension of this problem must remain foremost in our minds as we conduct deliberations on this matter. Our aim must be to prevent not only the irresponsible flow of arms, ammunition and explosives, but also the indiscriminate attacks which inevitably result from illicit trade and trafficking.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">Our actions must also deal directly not only with States that engage in this activity, but also with non-State actors -- terrorist groups, criminal organizations and others -- that gain access to small arms and light weapons. In the past year, the world has recognized the threat that terrorism poses to freedom, security and global stability. The international community has resolved not only to combat terrorists directly, but also to insist that States end the financial and logistical support that makes terrorism possible. These efforts to deny terrorists the means to carry out their attacks must also include steps aimed at denying them access to small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">This may seem like an unattainable objective, but in fact it is entirely within our ability to achieve. Israel believes that the best way to curb the illicit circulation of small arms and light weapons throughout the world is, first, through strong national commitment and determination. It is our view that States bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that no weapons, including small arms, are transferred from their territory without proper oversight. States must undertake adequate marking and recording procedures for all weapons, stringent export controls and appropriate domestic legislation to prevent the misuse and proliferation of arms.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">Action taken at the national level must be supplemented by regional coordination and cooperative international efforts. Arms proliferation is, after all, a transnational problem, exploited mainly by international terrorists and criminal organizations. If States adopt clear and explicit commitments to bar different entities under their jurisdiction from engaging in the illicit traffic of arms, withhold assistance from outside elements involved in this traffic, and cooperate in international and regional frameworks, we can greatly reduce the threat posed by these weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">The Programme of Action, adopted in July 2001 during the Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, represents an important first step in this regard. All efforts should be exerted to find ways and means to implement the provisions of the Programme of Action, including measures to pressure recalcitrant States to do more to fulfil their obligations. We are pleased with the progress that has been made, especially in several regional initiatives which constitute an appropriate framework for combating the illicit circulation of small arms and light weapons. Still, more work needs to be done to prevent arms from falling into the hands of those who would use them for criminally destructive purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">Israel is a country that, more than half a century after its establishment, continues to face threats both from States in the region as well as from terrorist organizations with increasing access to conventional weapons. Small arms in the hands of terrorist organizations have exacted a high price in human suffering, while also serving to obstruct efforts to achieve a durable peace. Not only in Israel, but in other parts of the world as well, terrorism has been a cause of political instability and hinders social and economic development. Clearly, small arms have not had small consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">Moreover, the relative speed and ease with which terrorist groups have built up significant stockpiles of conventional arms even raises the spectre of their one day being capable of deploying weapons of mass destruction. It is imperative that we act now to prevent even greater threats in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa10">In our region, we are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of the illicit traffic in small arms. Though the spirit and the letter of the Oslo agreements greatly restrict the number and type of weapons permitted to the Palestinian Authority, we remain perpetually at risk due to the dangerous violation of these accords.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa11">In the early morning of 3 January 2002, the Israel Defense Forces seized a ship called the Karine A, carrying 50 tons of weapons and ammunition bound for the Palestinian territories. The ship contained an enormous cache of weaponry that would have significantly elevated the ability of Palestinian terrorists to kill and maim Israeli civilians. Among the weapons found were a large number of rockets, mortars and launchers; anti-tank weaponry, mines and explosives; and other types of light weaponry, including sniper rifles, assault rifles and hand grenades. The Karine A and the weapons discovered aboard it were financed by the Palestinian Authority with the assistance of other States in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa12">The use of boats to carry weapons intended for terrorist use, without any country accepting responsibility, is a phenomenon that should be declared unacceptable by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa13">Furthermore, last April, in the course of Operation Defensive Shield, Israel seized nearly 2,000 Kalashnikov rifles, almost 400 sniper rifles and over 2,000 long rifles from Palestinian terrorists. These weapons are in addition to the pistols, mortars, grenades, launchers, bombs and other explosive devices that Israeli forces discovered. Much of this weaponry was purchased with the help of other regimes in the Middle East. It hardly needs to be mentioned that these weapons are intended not for defensive purposes but to escalate the terrorist campaign against the citizens of Israel and that they serve only to create ever-greater obstacles along the path to peace and reconciliation. Many of the weapons seized were subsequently destroyed.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa14">We wish to take this opportunity to call upon our neighbours and all the countries in the region to adopt a responsible policy and to take the necessary measures to stop the flow of arms from their territories to terrorist groups. We expect the international community to join us in that call. The result of this flow of arms is the fuelling of the conflict by increasing the amount of illegal arms in terrorist hands, thereby adding to human suffering, animosity and instability in the region. Terrorism, after all, is only viable if countries allow, and even support, its fortification by weapons transfers.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa15">The Security Council, as the body now charged with coordinating the international efforts against terrorism, must also address the role of arms proliferation in terrorist activities. Specifically, in the context of the counter-terrorist measures it is requiring of all States, the Council must issue a call for the implementation of measures to prevent arms from falling into the hands of terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa16">Israel continues to face threats to its very existence, as well as a regional build-up of conventional weapons. We therefore have consistently attached great importance to confronting overall proliferation threats and challenges, including small arms, and have placed counter-proliferation high on Israel's security agenda. We share the efforts of like-minded States to place this issue at the top of the arms control agenda. We also believe that cooperation and coordination at the international level should be strengthened in the continuing fight against proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa17">Israel adheres to strict export control regimes. Israel's firm arms-transfer policy includes tight controls aimed, inter alia, at the prohibition of exports to regions or States under United Nations Security Council sales embargoes, non-State entities, subversive and underground movements, terrorist or guerrilla groups, criminal organizations, or areas where there is ongoing internal armed conflict between rival parties. Moreover, Israel's export control regulations concerning the export of small arms and light weapons obligate the exporter to apply for separate and specific licences from the relevant authorities, including negotiation permits and export licences.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa18">In addition, Israel invests in research, development and production of new technologies and equipment to prevent the illicit smuggling of arms along its borders and points of entry. Israel has an extremely advanced marking and record-keeping system, which is an integral part of the production process. This marking is very reliable.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa19">Israel is willing to work with other countries in our region to coordinate our efforts and share our experience in combating the illicit spread of small arms and light weapons. We remain committed to working in a cooperative, regional approach, as part of a shared global commitment to end the tragedy caused by these weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa20">Finally, Israel believes that the international community should recognize the right of States to acquire and produce small arms for self-defence and the necessities of national security, as determined by each State. However, the international community does have the right to insist that the use of these weapons be restricted to self-defence and national security purposes only. Moreover, we have the full right -- and, indeed, the obligation -- to demand that States ensure that these weapons do not fall into unauthorized hands.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Stagno</span> <span class="nation">Costa Rica</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">As long as weapons exist, it will be impossible to achieve peace. Arms are a catalyst to armed conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">The arms market has perverse consequences. In 1998 there were 588,000 deaths in various conflict areas as a consequence of the use of small arms and light weapons. In 41 countries, 300,000 child soldiers take part in active combat, while insurgent and paramilitary groups have recruited another 500,000. If we add the number of displaced people and of those whose fundamental rights have been affected by violence, the total number of victims is intolerable.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on small arms and, in particular, its emphasis on the need for the Security Council and the General Assembly to coordinate their efforts to regulate the traffic and use of these weapons. In this context, we consider it essential for the Security Council to cooperate in the full implementation of the Programme of Action adopted by last year's United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">War is a business. Regardless of how bloody or unjust it may be, war is always a business. Ninety-eight countries maintain arms industries that, by definition, depend on war to exist. Among those States only 22 have published official reports on their sales and transfers of weapons. Arms manufacturers profit from war and, on occasion, do so at the expense of public treasuries. The production of weapons is also highly subsidized. Various Governments offer financial incentives to their weapons industries through "offset agreements" and "recoupement fees" in order to make those industries more competitive on the global level. The States with arms industries are therefore indirectly responsible for wars.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">Greater transparency in the international weapons market is required. Currently, only 20 per cent of the international legal market in small arms and light weapons can be documented and traced through the respective customs services. Sales licences, end-user and final-destination guarantees and other measures to control the arms market are totally insufficient.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">Illicit parallel arms markets continue to exist, thanks to the action, or inaction, of many Governments. In 2001 alone, 54 States were linked to transfers or resales of arms, in clear violation of existing international arms embargoes.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">This deadly trade, which does not respect borders, requires international regulation. Therefore, although we welcome the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its three Protocols, we regret that it does not cover the sale or transfer of arms among States or non-State entities. Unfortunately, the Programme of Action adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects suffers from the same deficiencies.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">Costa Rica fully endorses the first recommendation in the Secretary-General's report to the effect that the Security Council should support the negotiation of an international instrument on the transfer of small arms. Since 1997, my country has been advocating the adoption of an international code of ethics for arms transfers. The draft instrument, which seeks to ban the transfer of military hardware and personnel and to eliminate financial and logistical support for those States whose armed forces, police or paramilitary units participate in or contribute to the violation of human rights, was prepared and endorsed by 19 individuals and institutions -- all Nobel Peace Prize laureates -- including our former President, Oscar Arias Sánchez. We urge all Member States that are committed to a stable and lasting peace to support that initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa09">We also support the Secretary-General's recommendation that the Council resort more frequently and resolutely to embargoes on arms and ammunition and adopt strong measures to ensure full compliance and verification. It is essential for the Council to examine the possibility of imposing sanctions on those States that flagrantly violate -- whether directly or indirectly -- arms embargoes. Likewise, all States must participate in the United Nations Conventional Arms Register and publish reliable information on their military expenditure and arms transfers.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa10">My delegation fully agrees with the Secretary-General that the Security Council must examine and respond to the harmful interrelationship among the illicit transfer of weapons, drug trafficking and the illicit exploitation of natural resources. In this regard, we would like to recall the valuable and courageous reports on the illicit exploitation of natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa11">We believe that it will be necessary to request similar reports to evaluate the actual implementation of arms embargoes and to study the sources financing of the illicit arms trade.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa12">Of the 138 States that have provided information, 51 devote more resources to their military budgets than to education, health care and preventive health care. In the twenty-first century, there are too many societies that are armed, yet illiterate and sick. The fight against the use and proliferation of these weapons requires the demilitarization of our societies and the creation of a true culture of peace in which the basic rights of all are recognized.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa13">In this context, the Security Council must not only support efforts at disarmament but promote the reduction of military budgets. We note the Secretary-General's seventh and eighth recommendations to the effect that the Security Council should include measures aimed at the disarmament and demobilization of combatants within the mandate of peacekeeping operations. We believe it necessary, however, for those mandates also to seek the total disarmament of those societies in which there is armed conflict, as a necessary step towards stable and lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa14">Costa Rica fully supports the holding of the first biennial meeting to be convened in accordance with the Programme of Action of the Small Arms Conference. We trust that the meeting will be held in July 2003 here in New York.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mbanefo</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">I am very happy to see you, Sir, presiding over this meeting today. I should like to congratulate you very warmly on your assumption of the presidency for this month.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">My delegation warmly welcomes the Secretary-General's report, which we consider very useful and helpful.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">The issue of the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons continues to be a matter of great concern to my delegation, considering the fact that the use and ready availability of those weapons are a major source of insecurity and contribute to socio-economic stagnation throughout the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa, the region to which we belong. They have become the most common means of prosecuting armed conflicts, civil wars and criminal acts in our societies. It is important to recognize that while nuclear weapons -- weapons of mass destruction -- may present a grave danger to the world, it is small arms and light weapons that have been responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of people in the world today.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">The ever-expanding use of these weapons and their consequences present the international community with a new challenge. This is mainly because their proliferation sustains conflicts, exacerbates violence, contributes to the displacement of civilians and undermines respect for international humanitarian law. It poses a new threat to humanity in the form of terrorism and organized crime. It has a negative impact on women and the elderly and devastating consequences on children. The world must seriously face the grave challenges posed by these weapons if our civilization and economic progress in the twenty-first century are to be maintained.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">Unfortunately, this problem has grown to such immense proportions that it is practically impossible for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa to focus attention on issues of development without first resolving the problem of the illicit transfer of these weapons to their territories. Any action by the international community that could put an end to this negative phenomenon would, no doubt, constitute the first major step towards helping Africa to achieve sustainable and meaningful development.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">My delegation is deeply concerned that, despite the serious danger that the illicit use of these weapons poses, there is currently no international treaty or other legal instrument to control their use. We therefore wish to reiterate the call made by my President, Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, to the General Assembly on 15 September 2002 for a legally binding international instrument to control access to these weapons by non-State actors. We are, however, encouraged by the attention the Council has so far given to this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">It is gratifying to note that there is increasing multilateral cooperation on the issue of small arms and light weapons. This was demonstrated last year with the convening, here in New York, of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, which adopted a Programme of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in these weapons. The Programme of Action contains a comprehensive set of measures to address the problem. We note with appreciation and satisfaction that that Conference -- the first of its kind on this issue -- generated political will and momentum for efforts to control these weapons. We urge the international community to sustain that momentum for progress. We also emphasize the need for full implementation of the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">My delegation is also pleased with the successful negotiation of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, which was adopted on 31 May 2001. Although the Protocol is supplementary to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, its adoption was a positive development in the fight against the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons. We therefore appeal to all Member States to sign and ratify the Protocol.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">While these are welcome developments towards combating this menace, we should not indulge in the euphoria of victory, as there are still hurdles ahead. Because of the multifaceted nature of the causes of armed conflicts that partially prompt the proliferation of these weapons, it is imperative that this problem be tackled in a comprehensive and integrated manner. In that regard, we wish to express our belief in the need to build on the existing national and regional initiatives and develop a common international approach to control the illicit spread of these weapons. Equally important is the need to address the underlying causes of conflicts in general, including issues of poverty and underdevelopment as well as socio-political issues.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">My country, Nigeria recognizes the importance of this subject matter, and has initiated action at various levels to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. At the national level, Nigeria has put in place practical measures to tackle the problem with the establishment of the National Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons. Last year, Nigeria declared the first day of the United Nations Conference on Small Arms as Small Arms Destruction Day in conformity with the decision reached at the Preparatory Committee of the Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa11">At the subregional level, Nigeria joined other countries members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in October 1998, to declare a three-year moratorium on the import, export and manufacture of small arms and light weapons. This was accompanied by a Programme for Coordination and Assistance on Security and Development in order to address the security and development problems associated with the proliferation of these weapons in West Africa. ECOWAS has renewed the moratorium for a second three-year period with effect from 5 July 2001. My delegation wishes to reiterate our call to the international community to support the implementation of the moratorium. We also urge other regions to follow the example of ECOWAS by imposing similar moratoriums in their respective regions.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa12">At the regional level, Nigeria joined other African countries in December 2000 to adopt the Bamako ministerial declaration containing Africa's common position on the illicit proliferation, circulation and trafficking in small arms and light weapons. We take this opportunity to reaffirm our belief in the principles enunciated in the declaration, including the one that calls on the international community, particularly arms-supplier countries, to limit the trade in small arms to Governments and registered licensed traders.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa13">As part of our efforts in this area, Nigeria, along with South Africa, Mali, Kenya, Norway, Austria, Canada, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, sponsored the African Conference on the Implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms: Needs and Partnerships, which took place in Pretoria, South Africa, from 18 to 21 March this year. The Conference brought to the fore the need for the Security Council to pay particular attention to this problem.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa14">It is our strong belief that efforts aimed at addressing the problem should be multidimensional if they are to succeed. The international community should demonstrate its sincere will to rid the world of these weapons by enacting appropriate international legislation to control arms transfers. This should include mechanisms that would facilitate the identification of such transfers. It is also important that such mechanisms ensure appropriate sanctions against manufacturers and suppliers that violate relevant global regulations. This calls for transparency and confidence-building measures.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa15">Of even greater importance is the need for us, as members of the international community, to promote conflict prevention measures and the pursuit of negotiated solution to conflicts. Our emphasis should be on promoting structures and processes that strengthen democracy, human rights, the rule of law and good governance, as well as economic recovery and growth, as means of eliminating conflicts and generating durable peace. It is evident from this that our task in this area is enormous and calls for genuine commitment and concerted action on the part of the global community.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Løj</span> <span class="nation">Denmark</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia -- and the associated countries, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European Free Trade Association country of the European Economic Area, Iceland, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">Mr. President, thank you for convening this open debate of the Security Council. Currently more than 500 million small arms and light weapons are estimated to be in circulation worldwide. The uncontrolled accumulation and spread of these weapons have devastating political, social, economic and humanitarian consequences. The issue calls for urgent international action. The European Union would like to emphasize the importance of addressing the problem at all levels: national, regional and international. Today's debate in the Council is therefore timely and, indeed, necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">The EU actively seeks to alleviate the human suffering caused by these weapons. First and foremost, we need to counter the illicit trade and proliferation of small arms and light weapons. The European Union played an active part in the 2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We engaged constructively in the elaboration of the United Nations Programme of Action. We had hoped for a stronger Programme. We especially would have liked to see firmer commitments in regard to export controls, stockpile management, marking and tracing, as well as brokering. However, we must now look ahead. In this regard, the EU welcomes the emergence of new partnerships among States, civil society and non-governmental organizations as a follow-up to the Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">The European Union actively pursues the prompt implementation of the Programme of Action. This is not only a disarmament issue. The problem is multi-dimensional and should be addressed accordingly. We remain committed to an effective, ambitious and continuous follow-up process leading, through the biennial meetings to be held in 2003 and 2005, to the review conference to be held in 2006. The EU stands ready to assume responsibility in this process. The meeting in 2003 will be the first occasion to take stock of the progress made. Stock-taking must be dynamic and operational. The outcome should include proposals for strengthening and further developing the measures contained in the Programme of Action. Legally binding commitments on marking and tracing, as well as on brokering, should be further pursued. That must be followed up in 2005. Only thus will we be able to achieve concrete results and to further our initial goals at the 2006 review conference.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">The EU commends the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1053</a>) on small arms. We welcome his recommendations. They are well founded and constructive, and they merit implementation. We remain convinced that initiatives by Member States, by the General Assembly, by the Security Council and by all other relevant bodies and organs must be mutually reinforcing.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">On behalf of the European Union I would like to thank the Security Council for its decisions and actions thus far with regard to small arms and light weapons. The EU encourages the Security Council to continue its ongoing efforts and to add impetus to implementation at the operational level. As a first step, the EU would propose that the Council concentrate its efforts on a limited number of the recommendations. First, in order to ensure concrete effects, the Council should encourage Member States to enforce all its sanctions resolutions, including those that impose arms embargoes, and it should call for investigation of alleged violations of those embargoes. Secondly, the Council should continue to strengthen the provisions in its mandates for peacekeeping operations on the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants, as well as measures for the collection and destruction of illicit and surplus weapons. Finally, the Council should establish monitoring mechanisms under each relevant Council resolution in order to further ensure implementation. The European Union, for its part, stands ready to contribute to, and to support efforts towards, a world free of the illicit trade in and proliferation of these weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">The EU Joint Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons constitutes the overall framework for EU policy within that field. It stipulates a set of principles and measures that the EU will pursue in relevant international and regional forums, and it contains provisions for technical and financial assistance. The Union is continuously developing the Joint Action in the light of experience. Thus far, we have had success in a wide variety of projects, but we can improve -- and we will do so. Therefore, the EU, in July 2002, decided to extend the scope of the Action's application to include ammunition. We look forward to and welcome any initiatives on strengthening our common efforts in the fight against the spread of small arms and light weapons in an effective and lasting way.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nambiar</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">We thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open debate of the Security Council on small arms and for allowing us to speak so early in the afternoon.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">India is particularly aware of the complexity and the lethality of the problems associated with the accumulation, dispersal and transfer of illicit small arms and light weapons. As we have stated in the past, the trade in small arms is licit only if their export and import take place through official, legal channels. Arms exported by a Government that violates none of its own laws are nevertheless illicit if they are sent to non-State actors in another country, bypassing or subverting laws there.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">During the past decade, illicit weapons have been the weapons of choice in an overwhelming number of major conflicts. Annually, small arms claim between 300,000 and 500,000 lives, of which the overwhelming percentage are civilian lives -- many of those the lives of women and children. In India, we are particularly conscious of the lethality of such weapons. Over the past two decades, more than 35,000 innocent people have fallen victim to the depredations of terrorists using illicit weapons. The seizures of small arms and explosives by the Government of India make it abundantly clear to us that that illicit pool is of a magnitude and of a sophistication that require urgent and serious attention on the part of all law-abiding societies.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">In his report on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects (<a href="../pdf/A-57-160.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/160</a>), the Secretary-General has provided an overview of the activities undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations to implement <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-24.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 56/24</a> V, adopted by the Assembly on 24 December 2001. That report, which covers the period from June 2001 to June 2002, includes actions taken to implement the Programme of Action adopted at the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held in New York in July 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">India is privileged to be playing a leading role as Chairman of the Group of Governmental Experts established by the Secretary-General to examine the feasibility of developing an international instrument to enable States to identify and trace, in a timely and reliable manner, illicit small arms and light weapons. The Group of Governmental Experts has held the first of its three mandated sessions, and it has been able to identify a number of elements of common understanding, on which work will continue at its forthcoming sessions. The Group will submit its findings to the Secretary-General during the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">India welcomes the report of the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/1053</a>, which reflects recent initiatives taken by the Security Council. We were also pleased to hear the statement by Under-Secretary-General Jayantha Dhanapala. The Secretary-General's report identifies areas where further action by the Council is required in addressing the global problem of illicit small arms and light weapons. It emphasizes the key role of the Council in preventing, combating and eliminating the uncontrolled spread of such weapons. In his report, the Secretary-General has listed a number of recommendations based on suggestions made by Member States. We find many of them to be very useful. Some of them are directly addressed to the Council. We trust that the Council will take appropriate further action with respect to the recommendations that are directly within its competence. We also hope that the Council will consider ways of enhancing its cooperation with the General Assembly on these issues.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">We note other initiatives taken, including the joint initiative by France and Switzerland to define a political arrangement on cooperation with regard to the traceability of illicit small arms and light weapons, as well as to the voluntary furnishing of information by States on implementation of the agreed Programme of Action. India fully supports the first step of developing a comprehensive tracing system and enhancing cooperation among States towards that end. In this connection, we see the need to strengthen the effectiveness of the Interpol Weapons and Explosives Tracking System. We similarly recognize the role played by the Coordinating Action on Small Arms mechanism in highlighting how illicit small arms and light weapons have actually prolonged conflicts and, indeed, prevented the re-establishment of peace in various conflict areas around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">A collective and cooperative initiative by the international community needs the participation not only of Governments, but also of concerned non-governmental organizations and agencies and of elements of civil society at large, in order to provide the most effective framework to fight the scourge of illicit small arms and light weapons. The Secretary-General has commended not only the consolidation of existing partnerships between States and civil society organs around concrete actions, but also the emergence of new partnerships.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">The area of the linkages among the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, the illicit exploitation of natural and other resources and the trade in narcotic drugs is an important one. Over the past decade, the Council has established embargoes to cut off the supply of arms to non-State actors.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">Where these have been bypassed, the Council has authorized investigations which uncovered the criminal networks established across continents which are being used to sell diamonds and supply arms, as well as for the export of drugs in furtherance of terrorist interests. We would urge the Council to continue to take initiatives to monitor relevant areas with regard to embargoes and to tackle the problem in all its aspects. The cooperation and sharing, among Member States and among various bodies under the Council, of information on arms traffickers that have violated embargoes established by the Council would be a step in building up a coordinated approach. This also demands the attention of the Council, the General Assembly and other relevant bodies of the United Nations. For its part, the international community too must generously support economic programmes of rehabilitation to encourage the surrender of illegal arms.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">Perhaps only around 1 per cent of the global supply of small arms is illicitly held, but that amounts to more than six million weapons. That is an alarming figure, considering that they are held by criminals, terrorists, armed insurgents, secessionists and other non-State actors. While three fourths of the global trade in small arms is legal, illicit trade in weapons and ammunition accounts for about $1.5 billion a year.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa12">Further, small arms are now ever more easy to use, lighter and more lethal, and their users need little or no training to use them to devastating effect to their societies and economies. Governments that desire to protect their societies from this problem must take the necessary national measures to introduce and monitor vigorous standards and conditions on private holdings of such weapons. All responsible States must undertake an obligation not to supply such weapons to non-State actors. Manufacturers and exporters should be subject to the strictest controls. There should be the strictest insistence on authenticated end-user certificates to ensure effective control over the export and transit of such weapons. The international community, for its part, must ensure that the trade in arms must, as in the case of the rest of the international trade, flow only through channels authorized by both the exporting and the importing Governments.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa13">It is ammunition and explosives that kill. Arms are only the means of delivery. This must be factored into any work done by the international community to tackle, comprehensively, the issue of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa14">We welcome the initiative of the Security Council in convening this open debate on small arms and light weapons and trust that the Council will take effective and practical steps to take forward the endeavours of the United Nations in support of the implementation of the Programme of Action adopted at last year's United Nations Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons that would check the availability and use of illicit small arms in fuelling and sustaining conflict and terrorism.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Ndhlovu</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">I wish to make use of this opportunity, Sir, to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. It gives my delegation particular pleasure to see the representative of a fellow African country, Cameroon, presiding over the debate on the important issue that is on the agenda of today's meeting of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">South Africa also wishes to thank the Secretary-General for his report on small arms, document (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1053</a>), and wishes to express its appreciation of the Security Council's continued interest in this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">My delegation notes with some concern that, just over a year after the adoption of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, we are still faced with the proliferation and excessive accumulation of those weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">The Programme of Action on small arms that was adopted in July 2001 sets out the steps that we as Member States need to take at the national, regional and global levels in order to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. With its adoption we recognized and highlighted the problems associated with those weapons by placing them on the international agenda, but we have now gone beyond that stage and must move towards long-term, concrete action. South Africa believes that the Programme of Action remains the only globally recognized framework that we now have for the implementation of the commitments that we as Member States made in July last year.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">The proliferation and excessive accumulation of small arms and light weapons around the world -- and particularly in Africa, where they are still the weapons of choice in intra-State conflict -- have not abated. These internal conflicts on our continent are by their very nature particularly violent in character; and the impact that they have on civilian populations is catastrophic. Not only do women, children and the elderly fall victim to violence, but those that are able to flee are often forced to do so, with the result that those internally displaced people are no longer economically active. The adverse impact that this has on social and economic development in these countries is incalculable and often takes decades to overcome.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">In Africa, our New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) includes a peace and security initiative that maps out the promotion on our continent of long-term conditions for development and security. In that context, we as Africans aim to build our continent's capacity to manage these conflicts by strengthening our existing regional and subregional institutions to deal with conflict prevention, management and resolution; peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace enforcement; post-conflict reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction; and combating the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">The heads of State or Government of the African Union have this year also expressed their concern that no single factor has contributed more to socio-economic decline in Africa and to the suffering of civilian populations than the scourge of conflicts within and between States. In that regard, they adopted a Protocol to the Constitutive Act of the African Union whereby a Peace and Security Council was established in the Union, as a standing decision-making organ for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. The Peace and Security Council will serve as a collective early warning body to facilitate prompt and effective responses to crisis situations in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">We are encouraged by the developments in Angola this year and, more recently, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Yet, at the same time, we are faced with enormous challenges. I have just referred to a comprehensive approach to post-conflict peace initiatives, as set out in NEPAD. To that end, diplomacy and concrete efforts to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate ex-combatants are integral to this approach. Our experience in Southern Africa has showed that, paradoxically, illicit transfers of small arms pose a potentially bigger threat to neighbouring countries when a country is emerging from civil strife than while it is involved in such strife. Accordingly, South Africa fully supports the Secretary-General's recommendations relating to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration initiatives and the need to include measures relating to such efforts in the texts of peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">South Africa believes that, of all the levels at which the Programme of Action should be fully implemented, none is as important as the need to focus on national implementation measures. Without a concerted effort to implement-- where they do not exist or are not functioning effectively -- systems that are aimed at controlling legal arms transfers and thereby contributing to preventing and eradicating illicit arms transfers, our collective endeavours to do so at the regional and global levels will be futile.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">In this context, my delegation welcomes the Secretary-General's recommendation that States should establish the necessary legislative and administrative measures, including the use of authenticated end-user certificates, to ensure effective control over arms transfers. South Africa has adopted a strict policy on this issue, and the legislative framework for this policy, the National Conventional Arms Control Bill, has been approved by our National Assembly and is nearing the final stages of adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">My delegation also supports the Secretary-General's recommendation that efforts be made to develop an international instrument to trace illicit small arms and light weapons. In this context, South Africa is pursuing these efforts through its participation in the group of governmental experts established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-24.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 56/24</a> V, entitled "The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects", to examine the feasibility of developing such an international instrument. It is our hope that this expert group will come up with concrete recommendations at the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa12">We are also encouraged by the Secretary-General's recommendation for enhanced interaction between the General Assembly and the Security Council on the issue of small arms. While we also recognize that both organs of our Organization have distinct mandates and roles, we would caution against embarking on separate or parallel courses of action on this issue that would duplicate our undertakings in terms of the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa13">Finally, South Africa also supports the Secretary-General's recommendations regarding arms embargoes and related Security Council sanctions. South Africa believes that not only is it incumbent upon all Member States to respect and abide by these, but that their full implementation will rigorously curtail the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition and Other Related Materials calls upon its member States to enact the necessary legislation and other measures to sanction the violation of Security Council arms embargoes, and our domestic draft legislation, to which I have just referred, also contains such a provision.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa14">In conclusion, South Africa believes that the Security Council plays, and will continue to play, an indispensable role in preventing, combating and eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects and in the implementation of the Programme of Action on small arms. Accordingly, we trust that the Council will remain seized of this matter.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Indonesia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Thayeb</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of Indonesia, I would like to express my appreciation to you for convening this meeting on what is, for us, a very crucial subject. We would also like to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his lucid report and to Under-Secretary-General Dhanapala for introducing it. The report has highlighted the role of the Security Council in combating the global menace posed by the illicit trade in small arms, which has been taken into account in its consideration of conflict-prevention, peacekeeping and peace-building activities.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">The report also contains numerous recommendations which warrant our careful attention. My delegation wishes to note in particular the recommendation to consider modalities to enhance the interaction between the General Assembly and the Security Council, especially in the context of the Programme of Action adopted by the July 2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">We are focusing our attention on the issue of small arms in the Security Council today because the only thing that continues to be small about small arms is probably their physical size. However, these arms continue to be big in stature, as they are big business and bring big profits. As a result, they continue to be a big problem. In every corner of the world, especially in the developing world, and particularly in areas of armed conflict, small arms continue to cause horrendous misery to families and are a significant cause of humanitarian distress. The deaths, injuries, forced displacement and the loss of homes, property and jobs they cause defy rational explanation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">There are also new areas of concern that merit the close attention of the international community. Many humanitarian agencies are reconsidering the previously sacrosanct principles of neutrality and impartiality as small arms proliferation endangers their activities and personnel. The humanitarian impact of small arms is escalating in magnitude and severity, largely as a result of the eruption of new conflicts facilitated by the continuing availability and use of small arms. Such impacts are difficult to quantify because of poor or non-existent data-collection facilities and insufficient international attention and concern.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">This is a grim picture in every respect. It is a combination of humanitarian, security and economic problems that demand the utmost in international cooperation. It is reassuring that the basis for such a response already exists. The July 2001 United Nations Conference on Small Arms referred to earlier adopted a Programme of Action, which is to be implemented at the national, regional and global levels.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">Today, Indonesia reiterates its support for, and its commitment to, the Programme as a first step in a comprehensive scheme to address this problem definitively. In our view, at this stage, the Organization should focus on the implementation of measures contained in the Programme before any new or additional measures are agreed upon. Furthermore, the issue of small arms is one in which the potential for multilateral action must be not only recognized but also self-evident.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">Following that Conference, the Government of Indonesia convened a workshop in Bogor last November to map out its national response. The primary aim was to introduce the Programme of Action to participating stakeholders, including governmental and non-governmental institutions, and to promote its internalization. It was also aimed at identifying the concrete legal, administrative, institutional and preventive measures that Indonesia can take in implementing the Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">As a result, there now exists a national consensus that its implementation should be pursued in a gradual manner, taking national capacity into consideration. It would ultimately depend upon strengthening national capacity-building through international cooperation, which is essential when national resources are limited. In addition, the establishment of a national focal point has recently been suggested to coordinate the implementation of the Programme of Action. There is also a need for the establishment of a national database to assemble information on the production, registration, circulation, mapping and transfer cycle of small arms and light weapons. Regional and bilateral cooperation, especially with neighbouring States, are essential in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">At the global level, Indonesia is aware of the need for States and the World Customs Organization to enhance cooperation with the International Criminal Police Organization to identify those groups and individuals engaged in the illicit trade of small arms. Equally important is the promotion of such cooperation and coordination among States, regional and international organizations, as well as civil society, including non-governmental organizations, in combating this menace. My delegation is also aware of the value of education and public-awareness programmes on the problems posed by illicit trade in small arms by promoting dialogue among relevant constituencies for a culture of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">These are imperatives that are close to the heart of Indonesia, and on which we intend to work in unity with other States and the United Nations so as to ensure that the problem of small arms, and their needless humanitarian consequences, are addressed in the shortest possible time. It must be recalled that this issue is so important that it forms an integral part of the Millennium Declaration, which called for concerted action by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa11">Before concluding, as referred to earlier by the representative of Japan, my delegation wishes to inform members that Indonesia, in cooperation with the United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs, will host a regional seminar to consider the implementation of the Programme of Action, followed by a workshop on transparency in armaments, in February 2003.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cappagli</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">My delegation is pleased to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council. We also welcome this opportunity to take up the item of small arms and light weapons. We thank the Secretary-General for his report on this item.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">The presence of more small arms and light weapons than are necessary for defence and security in various parts of the world, particularly the illicit trafficking in small arms, often associated with instability, is an age-old problem and complex in nature. To resolve this matter, we must have an integrated and proportionate approach, based on security and development.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">Fortunately, valuable proposals and processes are under way at various levels, but what we need now is cooperation at all levels. This will be a key element in efforts to combat illicit trafficking, and also to prevent and curb the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">The Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, adopted last July, crystallized the political will of the international community to tackle this item. It also laid the basis for dealing with the humanitarian and economic dimensions of the problems caused by small arms and light weapons. Member States thereby undertook to cooperate with the United Nations system to actually implement the arms embargoes imposed by the Security Council under the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">At the same time, the Council was urged to look, in each individual case, at the possibility of including in the mandates and budgets of peacekeeping operations, where necessary, relevant provisions on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">We welcome the innovative steps taken by the Security Council to enhance compliance with arms embargoes -- for example, the monitoring mechanisms and the panels of experts.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">Turning to the observations and recommendations in the Secretary-General's report, I would like to offer the following comments: we support the idea of drafting an international instrument to enable States to identify and trace small arms and light weapons in a timely and responsible way, and we think it appropriate that States, as required, use the Interpol weapons and explosives tracking system and to provide technical and financial support to it.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">I would take the opportunity of asking for more details about the small arms advisory service that the Secretariat is considering setting up using extrabudgetary resources. We would be interested in knowing what exactly this advisory service would be.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">We definitely believe the Security Council and the General Assembly should study ways of improving interaction on matters relating to small arms, so as to promote the preparation of long-term strategies within the context of conflict prevention and peace-building, and also within the context of the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">We believe that Recommendation 5 is fundamental in the sense that it would call on Member States to apply all the Security Council resolutions on sanctions. We also welcome the request for regular reports by some of the sanctions Committees to Member States on the measures adopted to implement the resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">We agree that the Security Council should continue its efforts to determine existing links between illicit small arms and light weapons trafficking, the illicit exploitation of natural resources, among others, drug trafficking and armed conflict. We also believe the Council could prepare innovative strategies to tackle this phenomenon, and we think it appropriate that the Council help in detecting the manufacture of and illicit trafficking in such weapons. We would draw attention to the work done by the panels of experts on Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone in this connection.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa12">Recommendations on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants should, in our opinion, be complemented with conflict-prevention measures, and also measures to prevent the recurrence of conflict. For, after all, weapons are only the tools that exacerbate it. We would reiterate the advisability of using authenticated end-user certificates. This is a commitment that Member States have already undertaken to provide under the Programme of Action. It would be one of the measures for action at the national level.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa13">Swift and strict implementation of embargoes by the Security Council, and adoption of coercive measures against Member States that violate these embargoes, would be a significant contribution to combating the scourge of small arms and light weapons. Argentina strongly favours transparency in armaments as a way of promoting stability and reducing tensions. In our view, the concept of transparency also applies to small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa14">We fully agree with those that maintain that States themselves have the primary responsibility for handling the problems caused by small arms and light weapons. Therefore, we believe that emphasis should be placed on the responsibility and cooperation dimension between Member States and the various bodies of the United Nations system, within the context of their respective fields, to strengthen any action aimed at controlling and eradicating the illicit arms traffic in those weapons at the global level.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Westdal</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">Canada welcomes the Secretary-General's report on small arms and the action it recommends to curb their proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">We especially value its recognition that human security, the safety of people and their communities, is the central goal of small arms policy and action; it is the point of controlling licit flows of those arms, curbing illicit trafficking and destroying excess weapons. That is why, to make them effective, embargoes against weapons must be respected and truly imposed.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">We are gratified that several of the recommendations we made in the Security Council debate on small arms last year have been incorporated in the report's recommendations. We also wanted funded provisions for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) in Security Council peacekeeping mandates and protection for children in peace agreements. We had also emphasized that control of natural resources like oil and diamonds could fuel deadly violence. We also commended Interpol's Weapons and Explosives Tracking System, which the Royal Canadian Mounted Police helped develop. In all those respects, we think we've been heard.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Westdal</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa01">The priority now, a year after the United Nations Conference, is to implement the Programme of Action. We want the biennial meetings in 2003 and 2005 and the next full conference in 2006 to have real impact worldwide against small arms proliferation. We think that that necessitates international conviction and action to contend with the problems of all small arms trade, not just its illicit dimensions.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa02">There has been heartening progress over the last year, notably in developing legislation, in promoting technology for marking and tracing, in coming to grips with harmful brokering and in weapon collection and destruction. We want the meeting next year to swell that momentum by fostering productive cooperation between States, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa03">For our part, Canada has been active. With host countries and partners, we sponsored seminars and encouraged non-governmental organizations in San Jose, Pretoria, Manila and several Central Asian centres. Presiding over the G-8, we promoted local, national and regional security sector reform in the G-8 Africa Action Plan. We underwrote the Canada/West Africa Peace and Security Initiative to professionalize institutions responsible for the protection of public safety. We supported small arms and human security projects in South and South-East Asia and helped study the socio-economic impact of small arms availability and use in Pacific Island States and the links between foreign direct investment and small arms-related crime and violence.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa04">Through the Biting the Bullet series, we supported essential public briefings on arms embargoes. We have also been proud to support the truly outstanding work of the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey, producing global baseline data for policy formulation and results measurement, emphasizing the devastating human impact of small arms proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa05">While we are pleased to cite significant early success in implementing the Programme of Action, we must not forget that the United Nations Conference was unable to address several key dimensions of the problems we confront, including the regulation of civilian possession and transfers to non-State actors. We thus believe policy and action against small arms proliferation should be based on, but not limited to, the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa06">In that context, we particularly welcome those elements of the Secretary-General's report that re-energize debate and transcend the Conference agenda. Several, noteworthy, warrant our robust support: the establishment of an international instrument to enable States to identify and trace illicit small arms and light weapons; legislative, administrative and related measures to ensure effective control over the export and transit of small arms and light weapons, a critical responsibility of all States; the effective monitoring and enforcement of United Nations arms embargoes, including coercive measures applied as needed to regimes and individuals; enhanced transparency in arms transactions, which is particularly timely, given the tenth anniversary this month of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms; and recognition of the link between the spread of illicit small arms and human rights violations, which is essential to any comprehensive understanding of the impact of small arms on human security.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa07">Canada's view is that the Secretary-General's report enhances our comprehension and our prospects for effective action against the cruel contagion of small arms and light weapons proliferation. We think the report will enrich our debate and deepen our commitment for years to come.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Staehelin</span> <span class="nation">Switzerland</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons represents a threat to human security in certain regions of the world. Switzerland expresses its satisfaction at the success of the 2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. The biennial meeting in 2003 will present the first opportunity to examine the progress achieved in implementing the United Nations Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">Over the last few months, Switzerland's international efforts have been concentrated on four aspects of the problem of small arms: marking and tracing, support for centres of competence, promotion of innovative approaches such as dealing with non-State actors, and in particular, national and regional implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms. In that last category, I wish to mention Switzerland's support for the recent conference in Pretoria on the implementation of the Programme of Action in Africa and our financing of seminars in Latin America. Switzerland welcomes the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1053</a>) and recommendations on small arms of 20 September, presented by Under-Secretary-General Dhanapala, and notes with satisfaction that the efforts deployed to date by Switzerland fall within the lines of action the report prescribes.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">A certain number of the report's recommendations, in our view, are of particular importance. In his recommendation 1, the Secretary-General expresses the wish that we support efforts to elaborate an international instrument that would allow States to identify and trace illicit small arms and light weapons in a timely and reliable manner. The French-Swiss initiative, previously mentioned by the French delegation, falls into that category. In that context, I also wish to recall the work of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Tracing Small Arms and Light Weapons. Switzerland expects that it will provide a useful contribution to the elaboration of a binding international instrument in this field.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">For Switzerland, the issue of small arms is an important aspect of integrated conflict-prevention strategies, peace-building and development cooperation. One of the great challenges in implementing the United Nations Programme of Action will be to make the issue of small arms a theme cutting across other political questions. Switzerland welcomes the Secretary-General's insistence on the necessity of an integrated approach, in particular in recommendation 4. In the same vein, recommendations 7 and 8 seek to extend the mandate of United Nations peacekeeping operations to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, as well as to specific measures concerning the collection and destruction of illicit or surplus small arms. Switzerland has already undertaken intensive activities in this respect, for example in Mozambique and Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">Finally, recommendation 5 refers to an aspect of the problem which Switzerland considers a priority. The Secretary-General underlines the role of information on small arms and invites Member States to pursue their efforts in this context. For some years now, Switzerland has supported, together with other States, the Small Arms Survey project in Geneva, which led, earlier this year and for the second time, to the publication of a yearbook which we consider very useful: Small Arms Survey 2002: Counting the Human Cost. Switzerland will continue in the future to support this essential work. I have the pleasure of announcing that, following what was done in English in Johannesburg, the French version of the yearbook will be presented to the public in New York on 24 October.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Jamaica. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Neil</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">To begin, I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. In view of the many preoccupations of the moment, you obviously have a difficult task on your hands, but you have our confidence and our support in guiding the work of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">It was a little over a year ago that the Council considered issues relating to small arms and light weapons, when Jamaica was still a member of the Council. It was an important initiative and a recognition that illegal traffic in those weapons plays a significant role in the continuation and prevalence of conflicts, which have such disastrous economic, social and humanitarian consequences. It was rightly recognized by the Council on that occasion that there needed to be some practical recommendations on ways in which to deal with the illicit traffic in small weapons. Those proposals are now before the Council, and I wish to commend the Secretary-General for his report contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/1053</a> and to thank the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs for the comprehensive briefing he provided this morning on this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">We have reviewed the report of the Secretary-General and the twelve recommendations contained therein. In general, they are useful and constructive proposals, although in some areas action could be taken further. There is obvious need to lift the profile and level of attention given to this issue in the United Nations system. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the report are instructive in highlighting the role of small arms and light weapons in conflicts during the 1990s and especially in relation to their heavy toll on civilian lives. When we add their use in criminal and terrorist activities, the statistics can be even more frightening. We therefore would have liked to see the recommendations go further in advancing international action and in increasing the obligations of Member States, particularly those engaged in the manufacture and trade of those weapons. There is need for greater control and internal regulation of the production and transfer of small arms and light weapons. Jamaica supports the early elaboration of an international agreement that would tighten those controls and provide mechanisms for the registration, identification and tracing of small arms. The process, which is currently in the hands of the Group of Experts, needs to be speeded up to arrive at an early draft international agreement for consideration and adoption by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">The recommendation for increased interaction between the General Assembly and the Security Council on ways in which to deal with the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons obviously needs to be pursued. An integrated approach would avoid duplication of mandates and would also ensure greater effectiveness, particularly in the provision and sharing of information and in the development of effective coordinated strategies.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">We have continually emphasized the linkages between the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and narco-trafficking, terrorism and transnational organized crime. Those linkages are now well recognized. While acknowledging the tremendous work done on those areas by various expert groups, there is need for more action by Member States to tighten controls on the manufacture and transfer of weapons. That is made even more necessary in these times as a result of the impact of globalization, which has facilitated illegal transactions across borders and has increased the need for regulation and improvements in detection. There has to be more accountability and stricter methods of control at the source and at the points of origin. Additionally, in the case of the States that are most affected, there is need for the provision of material and technical assistance for the development of training and monitoring mechanisms to control transit of those weapons across borders.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa06">With regard to punitive measures, we support more consistent action at both the international and national levels. Those involved in the illegal arms trade -- suppliers, purchasers, brokers, financiers and facilitators -- should be exposed and punished. Recommendation 11 refers to the use of coercive measures. We are not sure of the scope which is contemplated under this proposal, but it would be important that these be applied across the board, and not on a selective basis, wherever and whenever governmental complicity has been proved.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa07">With regard to the role of the Department for Disarmament Affairs, significant work is being done in conjunction with other relevant United Nations departments and agencies in the implementation of the Programme of Action. The Coordinating Action on Small Arms mechanism is playing a useful role in promoting the implementation of the Programme of Action, along with other United Nations departments and agencies, especially the United Nations International Drug Control Programme. Jamaica is also of the view that the establishment of a small arms advisory service would enhance this coordination through the provision of relevant advice and the formulation of relevant programmes. We therefore support this initiative and we encourage the provision of the necessary resources and assistance required for such a service.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa08">As the incidence of war and conflict continues to be a disturbing factor in the international environment, the challenges posed to international stability and the humanitarian consequences caused by the problem of small arms must remain high on the international agenda. Efforts to eliminate the illegal traffic should continue at all levels in order to ensure peace and stability in the world. The Security Council has a critical part to play and Jamaica can be relied on to give its support to the Council in taking decisive action.</p>

	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Namibia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Andjaba</span> <span class="nation">Namibia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Security Council and on convening this important meeting. I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his report on small arms and for the valuable recommendations contained therein. My appreciation also goes to the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs for introducing the report.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">Although slow progress has been made, in particular since the international community started to address the problem of small arms in a comprehensive manner, the easy availability of small arms worldwide continues to create havoc throughout the world, especially in Africa. They threaten peace and security and are responsible for countless numbers of deaths and injuries. Small arms are now estimated to kill half a million people every year. They have a devastating impact on every part of society, in particular vulnerable groups, such as children and women.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">Furthermore, small arms have a profound impact on the social and economic development of countries. Despite the urgent need to fight poverty and diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, a lot of money continues to be spent on the production and accumulation of these weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">The United Nations last year took a strong stand in addressing the scourge at the Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. The Conference adopted by consensus the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. The success in the implementation of the Programme of Action can now be seen in the national reports and implementation activities of Member States. The Programme of Action is indeed not an end in itself, but the starting point of comprehensive national, regional and international efforts to address the problem.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">We were, however, disappointed that the Conference failed to achieve agreement on two core issues relating to the problem of small arms and light weapons, namely, strict control over private ownership and the supply of small arms to non-State groups. These issues are so critical to the curtailment of small arms that the international community will have to address them at one point or another. My delegation looks forward to the biennial meeting to be held in 2003 and the Review Conference to be held by 2006 to take stock of progress and to consider further and more effective measures to combat the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">With regard to the implementation of the Programme of Action, several initiatives have been taken in the subregion of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), such as the adoption of the SADC Protocol on Firearms, Ammunition and Other Related Materials. Namibia has already ratified the SADC Protocol and this week held a national conference on its implementation. The main objective of the conference was for civil society organizations and government officials to discuss the creation of a long-term sustainable national plan of action for arms management and disarmament that would be in compliance with the international and regional obligations agreed to by Namibia.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">My Government also hosted the United Nations Workshop on Transparency in Armaments in Windhoek in June this year. The Workshop was sponsored by the Governments of Canada, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands and was attended by Government officials from countries in our subregion. The Workshop succeeded in creating greater awareness and participation in arms transparency instruments.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">The Security Council has, in the implementation of its mandate to maintain international peace and security, helped to prevent the flow of arms to conflict areas through the imposition of embargoes and other measures. The effectiveness of the Council measures has been strengthened by panels of independent experts and monitoring mechanisms. In the southern African subregion, these efforts produced positive results against UNITA by reducing its military capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa09">Apart from stopping arms from reaching conflict areas, it is equally important to eradicate arms that are already in circulation in conflict situations. In this regard, it is crucial for the Council to include in the mandate of peacekeeping operations clear provisions regarding the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants, as well as specific measures for the collection and disposal of illicit and surplus small arms and light weapons. However, in order for these programmes to be consistent and successful, their financing needs to be strengthened through the expansion of measures under the budget for peacekeeping operations so that they are not entirely dependent upon voluntary contributions.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa10">My delegation welcomes all the recommendations and observations in the Secretary-General's report. While many are already being implemented to a certain degree, it is clear that they should also be expanded and strengthened in order to have the maximum effect.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa11">In conclusion, no country, region or organization can alone resolve the problems caused by small arms. Indeed, a collective effort is required, and those that lack the capacity should be provided with the tools to do so. We therefore hope that the General Assembly and the Security Council will continue to address the issue of small arms within their respective mandates. Namibia remains committed to fully implementing the measures contained in the Programme of Action adopted at the United Nations Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, as well as those adopted by the Security Council aimed at the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>

	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa03">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Senegal. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fall</span> <span class="nation">Senegal</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa01">The presidential statement adopted by the Security Council on 24 September 1999 contains the following observation regarding the important issue under consideration today:</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa02">"The Security Council notes with grave concern that the destabilizing accumulation of small arms has contributed to the intensity and duration of armed conflicts. The Council also notes that the easy availability of small arms can be a contributing factor to undermining peace agreements, complicating peace-building efforts and impeding political, economic and social development. In this regard, the Council acknowledges that the challenge posed by small arms is multifaceted and involves security, humanitarian and development dimensions." (<i><a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1999-28.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1999/28</a>, second paragraph</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa03">As the Council is aware, and as the Group of Experts established in 1997 has stated, light weapons are so defined</p>
	<blockquote id="pg030-bk02-pa04">"because they are light and can be transported by a single or few individuals, by an animal or in a car".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa05">An estimated 500 million small arms are said to be in circulation around the world. Easy to handle, inexpensive and durable, small arms and light weapons fuel criminality, undermine social development and give rise to innumerable humanitarian catastrophes. As the Secretary-General has noted, small arms were the weapons of choice in 46 of the 49 major conflicts that bloodied the planet in 1990 -- which was 12 years ago, and therefore well before the genocide in Rwanda. In that period, small arms and light weapons were responsible for the deaths of 4 million people, 90 per cent of whom were women and children. That figure is in addition to the 5 million persons handicapped and the tens of millions of people internally displaced as a result.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa06">Although they are not the direct cause of conflict, small arms and light weapons are nevertheless the main factor in prolonging, perpetuating and aggravating conflict. They are therefore among the primary factors responsible for delays and deadlocks in the resolution of conflicts and in the implementation of painstakingly negotiated agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa07">In Africa these weapons are a real calamity, as they result in unspeakable, yet striking and observable, suffering. They also undermine national reconstruction efforts in many countries, promote every sort of trafficking and sap energy from legitimate economic and social development. This is particularly the case in the West Africa subregion, where these weapons are routinely recycled from one conflict to another by criminal gangs operating with the extra-continental complicity of veritable merchants of death and the active or passive complicity of notorious and pathetic warlords who are both shadowy and feared.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa08">Aware of the gravity of this new plague contributing to the proliferation of flashpoints of tension -- and in particular to the nourishing of many irredentist movements -- the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), over which my country currently presides, has placed the fight against the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects at the top of its Community-wide policy agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa09">The resolute commitment of West African countries led to the adoption by the ECOWAS summit held in Abuja in 1998 of the Moratorium on the Importation, Exportation and Manufacture of Small Arms and Light Weapons in West Africa. The Moratorium, which was endorsed by the Organization of African Unity at Lomé in July 2000, has been strengthened by the creation of a coordination and assistance programme in the area of security and development. The programme was created in close cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in order to create and disseminate a culture of peace, stability and shared security throughout the ECOWAS region.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa10">It goes without saying that the initiatives that have been launched in our subregion and in Central Africa at the initiative of Cameroon to halt the proliferation of small arms and light weapons must be integrated in a comprehensive, coordinated and coherent manner into a large-scale international campaign to maximize the impact of these initiatives, for the sake of the well-being of all human kind.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa11">As the Council is also aware, Secretary-General Kofi Annan -- who, because of the massacres they provoke, has aptly equated small arms and light weapons with weapons of mass destruction -- has condemned the paradox that,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg030-bk02-pa12">"unlike the case of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, no global non-proliferation regime for light weapons has yet been established by the international community".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa13">Nevertheless, the Senegalese delegation is pleased to note that the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects was held in New York in July 2001. The Conference led to the adoption of an important Programme of Action that has served to strengthen the common African position on the basis of such approaches and regional initiatives as the Bamako moratorium.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa14">While welcoming the central role of the United Nations in the success of that meeting and calling upon the Security Council to continue to actively consider the thorny problem of light weapons, Senegal would also like to point out that if we really want to put an end to this terrible scourge, the international community will have to encourage, support and perhaps even demand the implementation of at least five steps that are both radical and beneficial. I shall now describe them briefly.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa15">The first step should be to reinforce the legal instruments to control the proliferation of light weapons and combat cross-border criminality; to strengthen regulations with regard to arms transfers; and to support the implementation of the code of conduct that has been proposed to the United Nations by the Nobel Peace laureate group.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa16">Secondly, commercial transactions and arms brokerage activities should be carried out in a transparent manner, and annual reports on arms transfers, including those of light weapons, should be published.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa17">Thirdly, programmes for disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating former combatants should be promoted; national and regional capacities should be strengthened to supervise such disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa18">Fourthly, cooperation among producer and consumer States should be intensified and enhanced; producer States should officially renounce small arms transfers to consumers in countries or areas where a disarmament process is under way or a moratorium is in place.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa19">Fifthly, a dual system of tracing and marking such weapons should be established.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa20">It is thus clear that there is a long, steep, winding path ahead of us. The review conference, planned for 2006 at the latest, must yield tangible and meaningful progress if we do, indeed, wish to prevail in the bitter united struggle against the proliferation of small arms, with all its various ramifications and networks that are growing and prospering in the tentacular grip of this elusive force of devastation, this vile, multinational enterprise of crime -- international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa21">Given that the stability of States and the well-being of peoples throughout the world, particularly in Africa -- and, indeed, the very survival of humanity -- are in jeopardy, this meeting of the Security Council under the eminent presidency of the Permanent Representative of that land of symbiosis, Cameroon, should give added impetus to our efforts to achieve our important objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa22">For several reasons of which you, Sir, are very well aware, the delegation of Senegal welcomes the fact that you are presiding over the Security Council during this crucial month of October 2002 -- a month that will remain etched into the collective awareness of all of us -- we the peoples of the United Nations. While conveying to you all my compliments and my sincere wishes for success, I should like to express my full conviction that you will honourably carry out the sacred, fruitful and lofty duty entrusted to your outstanding country at this very complex and sensitive moment in the history of humanity -- the nexus between what has gone before and what is yet to come.</p>

	<p id="pg032-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Senegal for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Kenya. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg032-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ligabo</span> <span class="nation">Kenya</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa01">It is with great pleasure, Sir, that my delegation extends its appreciation to you for convening a public meeting of the Security Council under the agenda item entitled "Small arms". My delegation welcomes and fully supports the report of the Secretary-General on this item, <a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/1053</a>, particularly its recommendations on how to deal with the question of illicit small arms and light weapons. The report, which was excellently introduced by the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Dhanapala, points out that the spread of illicit small arms and light weapons is a global threat to human security and human rights. The report also underscores the fact that preventing, combating and eliminating the uncontrolled spread of these weapons constitutes one of the key tasks of the Security Council in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa02">The world has come a long way -- from apparent apathy to a deliberate and conscious effort to address the problems of small arms at the global level. That effort seeks to mitigate the enormous and ugly consequences that have continued to deny mankind the benefit of living free from threats and fear. My delegation is therefore convinced that the diversity of experience described at this public Security Council meeting will broaden our approach to the problems posed by illicit small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa03">Since the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held in July 2001, Kenya, as a country ravaged by the effects of illicit small arms, has been at the forefront in the war against the proliferation of illicit weapons. As noted by the Secretary-General in his report, there is no doubt that the United Nations Programme of Action adopted in July 2001 provides an adequate basis for further work at the national, regional and global levels, although there is a recognition that the primary responsibility for addressing the problem lies with States themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa04">I should like to share with the members of the Security Council the experience of our subregion on this issue. As members may recall, the 10 countries of the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa signed the Nairobi Declaration in March 2000 and mandated the Kenyan Government to coordinate regional activities in combating the circulation of illicit small arms and to convene a Ministerial Review Conference on the Implementation of the Nairobi Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa05">On 7 and 8 August 2002, the States parties to the Nairobi Declaration held the First Ministerial Review Conference on the Implementation of the Nairobi Declaration. The Conference brought together the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, the Sudan, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda. The Conference reviewed progress made in the implementation of the provisions of the Nairobi Declaration and came up with specific recommendations on how existing international and regional initiatives could be harnessed for the realization of the objectives set out in the Declaration. With regard to priority actions and guidelines on regional and national implementation plans, the Ministers agreed to establish national focal points and make them operational by the end of 2002 and to develop national action plans to combat the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. The Conference also reaffirmed the political will of Governments in the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa to tackle the proliferation of illicit small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa06">At the national level, Kenya will continue to work in Nairobi together with a group of friends of the Nairobi Declaration, comprising development partners, led by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and non-governmental organizations and representatives of the United Nations system, to harmonize strategies and assistance to address the scourge of illicit small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa07">The problem of the illicit circulation of small arms is multifaceted. To address it effectively, we need to find out how, and by and for whom, these weapons are manufactured, traded and used. How do we deal with the driving force behind the demand for small arms? The unresolved question concerning the role played by State and non-State actors in the proliferation of small arms is whether it is an appropriate time to comprehensively address this problem.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa08">My delegation would like to thank the Secretary-General for his timely decision to send a fact-finding mission to Kenya in August 2001 to study and evaluate the scope and magnitude of the problem of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. We appeal to the Secretary-General to look into the recommendations of that mission with a view to implementing them. We are encouraged by the recent initiative of the Security Council on identifying areas where further action is required by the Council in addressing this global scourge. We support the recommendation made by the Secretary-General to the Security Council to support efforts aimed at developing an international instrument to enable States to identify and trace, in a timely and reliable manner, illicit small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa09">Kenya welcomes with growing optimism the progress made in negotiations to settle long-standing conflicts in the southern Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and Burundi. Kenya will continue to spearhead efforts to resolve the conflicts in our subregion; I am happy to inform the Council that a peace conference on Somalia will be held in Eldoret, Kenya, on 15 October 2002. Furthermore, the southern Sudan peace process is scheduled to resume in Machakos, Kenya, later this month. Kenya's determination to support these efforts is predicated on a clear understanding that the resolution of these conflicts will immensely contribute to the reduction of the flow of illicit small arms in our subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa10">In conclusion, I wish to commend the Secretary-General once more for his report, which contains innovative measures to deal comprehensively with this problem. I further wish to appeal to all members of the Security Council and the international community at large to extend political, financial and technical support to regional initiatives in a spirit of true partnership, bearing in mind that we have a duty and responsibility to prevent, combat and eradicate the stockpiling of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons. We should be a beacon of hope with which future generations will be proud to identity. For the sake of posterity, let us collectively work hard to tame the ferocity of this menace.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Musambachime</span> <span class="nation">Zambia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa01">I wish once again to salute you, Mr. President, for convening this important meeting, which provides yet another opportunity for Member States to express their views on how the United Nations can best provide leadership in the search for peace and stability in the world. I recall that this is the second open meeting since your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. Given your immense diplomatic skill, I am confident that you will steer the deliberations of the Council on this item to a fruitful conclusion. Like your predecessor, my good friend the Permanent Representative of Bulgaria, Mr. Stefan Tafrov, you are committed to maintaining dialogue with Member States in order to enhance transparency and democracy in the work of the Security Council. This method should be maintained.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa02">I also wish to commend you, Mr. President, for your selection of the topic under discussion. The issue of small arms requires the urgent attention of the United Nations, as these weapons are used in many of the conflicts around the world and are a cause of a very high loss of life, especially of women and children.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa03">My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General presented by the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs this morning. We welcome his recommendations, which are well founded and instructive and which merit implementation as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa04">My delegation would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, <a href="../pdf/A-57-160.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/160</a>, which we found to contain useful information, assumptions and conclusions.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa05">In July 2001 the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects adopted a high-profile Programme of Action that helped to galvanize international efforts to curb this scourge during the past year.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa06">As part of the efforts to implement the Programme of Action, my country has taken a number of important steps at the national and regional levels. One such effort is the "guns for money" programme, in which the Zambia Police Service offers up to an equivalent of $55 to all voluntary hand-overs of illegally held arms. The response to this programme has been overwhelming. A large number of illicitly acquired arms have been recovered.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa07">At the regional level, Zambia has continued to be active in the Southern Africa Development Community programme on small arms and light weapons within the framework of the Southern African Regional Police Chief Cooperation Council. This effort, which started in 1995 in response to growing illicit trade and trafficking in small arms and their ammunition, is assisting Governments to coordinate their efforts at the regional level. The continuation of the programme, however, depends on the availability of funds. Zambia would welcome any financial and technical support from the cooperating partners in order to strengthen these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa08">As you are aware, demobilization and disarmament efforts are currently taking place in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. For this process to succeed, the disarmament component should have an effective and attractive arms recovery programme that can prevent combatants from trading their small arms for necessities and encourage them instead to hand them over to the authorized authorities for money. My delegation would like to see increased support to the buy-back and other arms recovery programmes in order to motivate the combatants to surrender to the authorities more of their arms, thus enhancing demobilization and disarmament of the former combatants and their reintegration into social life.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa09">Zambia believes that, as a follow-up to the United Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons, the adoption of an international instrument to trace illegal trade is imperative. In this regard, Zambia calls for the early conclusion of the work of the Group of Governmental Experts on the issue which met in Geneva last July, under the auspices of the United Nations. It is my Government's hope that the recommendations of the Group will help speed efforts to develop an international instrument that could provide a legal framework to trace the illicit trade around the world in the small arms and light weapons that fuel conflicts in Africa and other developing regions.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa10">Zambia supports all efforts at the regional and subregional levels to ensure strong momentum in the follow-up to the Programme of Action as we prepare for the biennial meeting of States on small arms and light weapons, the first of which is scheduled in 2003. So that many delegations will be able to attend that event, Zambia requests that it be held in New York, where many of the countries affected by the problem of small arms are represented. In addition, my country wishes to appeal to those countries that made pledges to implement the Programme of Action to make good on their commitments to provide financial and technical assistance and support to the Secretariat in order to facilitate the participation of the least developed countries, many of which are among the hardest hit by the negative impact of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa11">The course and the conduct of inter-State and intra-State wars in Africa clearly indicate that small arms and light weapons are a major cause of political instability. My delegation is concerned that all the global efforts to curb such weapons may not be successful unless the current trend to concentrate attention on officially held arms is checked. There is a need to establish a mechanism that will control private illicit transfers, which account for the bulk of the illicit trade. Such a move would be an effective way of preventing the supply of small arms to non-State actors.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa12">Regional and international initiatives must be encouraged if the fight against small arms is to be successful. My Government is committed to working with the rest of the international community at the regional and international levels. One of the most effective and practical methods of dealing with the problem of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is to destroy recovered weapons. Zambia hopes that all Member States can adopt that method because of its demonstrated effective impact on society.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa13">International cooperation can also be encouraged at the level of South-South cooperation. Developing countries can pool their resources and coordinate regional efforts; we should not always look to the North for resources. South-South cooperation driven by common threats and objectives could be very instrumental in curbing the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. In Africa, the effort should be extended to the relevant bodies of civil society in each country, including non-governmental organizations, which could spearhead awareness campaigns. The United Nations, through the Department for Disarmament Affairs and its regional centres, should remain at the forefront of that particular effort. The success of the 2001 Programme of Action depends on multilateral efforts strengthened through greater coordination and cooperation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Zambia for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Malawi. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg035-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lamba</span> <span class="nation">Malawi</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa01">First of all, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month. My delegation will support you fully in completing the agenda that you have set. Also, I wish to thank you for convening this, yet another important open debate on the question of small arms and light weapons as they affect global peace and security -- particularly in the Western and Great Lakes regions of Africa, where small arms continue to fuel conflicts and instability. Indeed, my own country, Malawi, has not been spared the ghastly consequences of these lethal weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa02">My delegation joins previous speakers in commending the Secretary-General for his informative report (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1053</a>) and for his sound proposals for moving more concretely towards effective containment of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. In the same vein, my delegation calls upon the Security Council and the General Assembly to close ranks with regional and subregional organizations and with other multilateral and civil society organizations to ensure the successful enforcement of previously agreed actions, including the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons, in order to stem the rising tide of the illicit trade in these dangerous weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa03">The problem of small arms was first encountered in Malawi in the early 1980s, when the country started to experience an influx of refugees from neighbouring countries where civil wars were raging. Malawi, which has enjoyed relative peace and stability since its independence in 1964, suddenly found itself confronting the infiltration and the use of illegal small arms. That situation led to an increase in criminal activities such as murder, armed robbery and car thefts by armed gangs, most of whom were alien to the country. While the Malawi Government is doing its utmost to keep in check the illicit flow and circulation of small arms, the country -- like many others in Africa -- continues to be held to ransom by those who are bent on spreading fear and insecurity, using these destructive weapons for their narrow self-interest.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa04">The proliferation and misuse of small arms has become a global problem and concern that calls for urgent action. While weapons of mass destruction -- such as nuclear weapons -- exist mostly in the developed world, small arms and light weapons are present and used throughout the world. In most developing countries, it is these latter weapons, more than nuclear weapons, that threaten peace and security. They are easy to acquire. Post-conflict situations often leave behind huge quantities of weapons that end up in unauthorized and dangerous hands.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa05">An urgent and compelling need exists, therefore, for a tough United Nations protocol, for implementation by Member States, to regulate or prohibit the possession and use of small arms. However, no United Nations measure can be effective without the cooperation of supplying nations. Even if a mechanism created through national legislation succeeded in retrieving small arms in circulation, arms manufacturers would have to come under a tough regime of international standards to be established by the United Nations to regulate acquisition and to enhance oversight and accountability. Many guns in developing countries remain unregistered and therefore unregulated.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa06">The proliferation of small arms, which generates violence and socio-economic destabilization, is no doubt a great threat to peace and security, which are the prerequisites for meaningful development in any country. Realizing the menace to Malawi of the effects of small arms, the Government is working closely with other States members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to implement a range of measures for monitoring and facilitating cross-border operations within the subregion. That is in line with the SADC protocols on firearms, ammunition and related materials signed by heads of State or Government at the SADC summit held at Blantyre, Malawi, in August 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa07">Malawi reaffirms its support for the outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held in July 2001, and looks forward to more active implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons at the national, regional and global levels.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa08">It is important to develop closer, mutually reinforcing linkages between the Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons and the Secretary-General's broad ranging recommendations presented today, in order to enhance implementation of the Programme of Action and strengthen global vigilance and decisive action against the illicit production and flow of surplus small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa09">In response to the widening problem posed by small arms in Malawi, law enforcement agencies have carried out regular surprise operations designed to recover many of these illegal weapons. Furthermore, through the assistance of the donor community, capacity-building programmes for law enforcement agencies, such as the police, customs, border guards, and the armed forces, are being conducted in order to prevent, combat and eradicate the proliferation of these illegal arms. The country is also finalizing the enactment of national legislation for the regulation of small arms and light weapons with a view to containing their ownership and minimizing their wanton and illegal use.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa10">I would like to conclude by pointing out that the problem of illicit arms cuts across borders and no one country is, therefore, insulated from their horrific effects. There is need, therefore, to step up collective efforts and collaboration in the global fight against this scourge. In this connection, my delegation looks forward to a more comprehensive review and monitoring of the performance of the existing measures and the adoption of other far-reaching mechanisms to take into account the Secretary-General's recommendations, which are constructive and call for deeper reflection by all States. Malawi undertakes to play its part in strengthening international resolve and commitment to combat and eradicate the proliferation of small arms through intensified cooperation with the United Nations and all Member States.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg036-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg036-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Malawi for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative for Pakistan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg036-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa01">The Pakistan delegation is gratified by your decision to convene this debate on the issue of small arms, an issue which has been a source of major human suffering during the past decade. We also appreciate the report of the Secretary-General on the subject, which contains many important recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa02">The post-cold war era has witnessed conflict and strife at levels unprecedented in recent history. The consequences of these armed conflicts were made worse by the easy availability of small arms and light weapons, increasing the intensity of the conflict, causing higher casualties, and making peacekeeping more complicated and risky.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa03">Having participated proudly in several important United Nations peacekeeping operations, Pakistan is fully aware of the complexities arising from the widespread presence of small arms and light weapons in regions where such missions have been conducted. We are also cognizant of the need for sound planning and implementation of strategies regarding de-weaponization and re-integration as part of peacekeeping and peace-building operations.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa04">During the long war against foreign occupation, Afghanistan became a repository of millions of small arms and light weapons. After the Soviet withdrawal, Pakistan became a victim of this proliferation of small arms and light weapons. Realizing the magnitude of this problem, the Government of Pakistan resolved to take strong action to cleanse our society of this menace.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa05">Last year, we therefore updated the Anti-terrorism Act and this year we have banned several organizations, some of whose members were involved in extremist or sectarian violence and terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa06">We have adopted a comprehensive strategy under which over 150,000 small arms and light weapons have been confiscated or voluntarily surrendered by the possessors of these arms. At the same time, the Government has stopped issuing licences for new weapons, while a ban on the display of weapons has also been imposed and is being implemented vigorously.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa07">We are confident that our efforts will produce good results, cleansing our society of the repercussions of the two decades of conflict in Afghanistan. The kind of national measures that we have undertaken could, we believe, be helpful to several other countries that may find themselves in similar circumstances. We would be happy to share our experiences with other developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa08">Pakistan applauds and welcomes the several regional initiatives that clearly recognize and seek to address the problem of small arms in all its dimensions, including human security, development, law enforcement, de-weaponization and arms control. It is obvious that only such a comprehensive approach that takes into account socio-economic factors can effectively address the problems associated with small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa09">We are happy to note the successful United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, which was held in July last year. The Programme of Action adopted by the Conference may not be perfect, but it is a significant step forward. In our view, efforts must now focus on the implementation of this Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa10">The Secretary-General's report in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-1053.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/1053</a> reviews the comprehensive measures being pursued to control small arms and their adverse impact on society and on peace and security. The report speaks of the "mixed results" achieved by the Security Council's embargoes so far in curbing the flow of small arms and light weapons in conflict areas. We endorse many of the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's report, including the need for effective enforcement of sanctions.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa11">At the same time, measures to control small arms must, in our view, give priority to a more effective role for the United Nations, and especially for the Security Council, in the resolution of the underlying causes of conflict. The causes of war are, in our view, more important than the instruments of war.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa12">We must also, seek to uphold and implement two principles that were endorsed by the General Assembly in its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-50-70.B.pdf" class="nolink">resolution 50/70B</a> on small arms and have been endorsed subsequently each year. These two principles are the right of States to exercise self-defence in accordance with the Charter, and the right of peoples struggling against foreign occupation to exercise the right to self-determination.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa13">We cannot forget the hundreds of thousands of patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice for the cause of freedom and liberty, which has enabled our nations to be here at the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa14">Pakistan honours the 80,000 Kashmiri heroes who have been killed by an occupation army of 700,000 in their decade-long struggle for self-determination. These three elements -- peaceful resolution of disputes, the right of self-defence and the right of self-determination -- must be appropriately reflected in the recommendations of the Secretary-General and in the debates and considerations of the Security Council in the context of small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa15">The General Assembly has asked the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to negotiate principles for conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels, such as the principle of undiminished security of States and elaboration of the concept of sufficiency in armaments. The adoption of such principles can make a useful contribution to specific negotiations for conventional arms control in various regions of the world, including the control of small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa16">Finally, let me add a word on behalf of the delegation of Colombia, which has asked me to inform the members of the Security Council that the non-paper that has been referred to by many delegations was sent to the presidency for circulation as an official Security Council document last night. We understand that it will also be posted on their Web site.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg038-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg038-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, to respond to the questions posed and comments made at this meeting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg038-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dhanapala</span> <span class="non-nation">Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa01">The hour is late, and I shall be brief.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa02">Let me begin by thanking all those who participated in this public debate for their very constructive proposals and for advancing the cause of the reduction of small arms and light weapons in the current stage of their proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa03">I believe that the debate has provided a major impetus to the movement that has begun within the United Nations on the control of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons and in the implementation of the decisions that have been taken.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa04">If I may respond to some of the points that have been raised, the Conventional Arms Register as it exists now is a voluntary transparency measure that is confined to seven categories of conventional weapons; it does not include small arms or light weapons. From time to time a group of experts meets in order to review the operation of this Register, as it will do next year. In that exercise, there will no doubt be consideration given to the possible expansion of the Register to include small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa05">With regard to the marking and tracing issue, the recommendation that was included in the Secretary-General's report was intended to encourage the efforts of the group of experts to reach a consensus on this issue, so that we may have progress with regard to a legal instrument on the question of marking and tracing.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa06">The 2003 biennial meeting that was presaged in the Programme of Action adopted at last year's Conference is being prepared carefully, and I know that the Ambassador of Colombia -- Ambassador Reyes, who presided over the 2001 meeting -- will convene a consultation on 18 October in order to discuss the detailed arrangements for this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa07">With regard to evaluation missions, the Department for Disarmament Affairs is ready to undertake them, but, again, the subject of resources comes up, and that is why we have appealed for extra-budgetary resources under the small arms advisory service.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa08">Coordination among all programmes, agencies and departments within the United Nations system is undertaken through the Coordinating Action on Small Arms (CASA).</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa09">I would also like to reassure those who expressed reservations about the possibility of established priorities in the disarmament agenda being disturbed by the focus on small arms and light weapons. Indeed, this is already taken care of. Preambular paragraph 17 of the Programme of Action states very specifically that we recognize that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg038-bk02-pa10">"these efforts are without prejudice to the priorities accorded to nuclear disarmament, weapons of mass destruction and conventional disarmament." <i>(A/CONF.192/15)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa11">Many questions were raised about the small arms advisory service that has been proposed in one of the recommendations. The main purpose of this unit is to enhance the effectiveness of CASA, enabling the United Nations better to assist Member States in the implementation of the Programme of Action adopted by the July 2001 Conference. The specific objectives of the small arms advisory service are, first, to ensure optimal coordination and harmonization of the Organization's activities in the field of small arms; secondly, to ensure that such activities are consistent with, and build upon, the political framework reflected in the Programme of Action; and thirdly, to provide relevant information on small arms and light weapons and other related issues to Member States and all interested entities as appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa12">It will serve as a permanent secretariat for CASA, providing advisory services to Member States and to United Nations agencies as requested and assisting them in the formulation and implementation of projects, particularly with regard to the conduct of assessment missions and monitoring activities.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa13">The financing of this advisory service will be covered from the United Nations regular budget through the provision of the Chief of Branch, who will supervise the work of the unit, and a P-4 staff member. Other outstanding costs will be covered either through contributions to the Department for Disarmament Affairs' Global and Regional Disarmament Trust Fund or through the provision of associate experts by Member States. The national points of contact will be the primary partner of the small arms advisory service in the task of the collection and circulation of information about the implementation by States of the Programme of Action adopted at last year's Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg038-bk02-pa14">This will be a two-way street. The national points of contact will send information on national activities to the small arms advisory service, and they will also make requests for assistance, which will be responded to. The service will keep national points of contact informed of developments and activities by other States, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations and about the availability of resources and expertise, and provide assistance as requested. We have a detailed document outside this Chamber providing information about the small arms advisory service that is available to all delegations.</p>
