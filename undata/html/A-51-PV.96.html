	<p id="pg003-bk12-pa01">In view of the desire of members to dispose of this matter expeditiously, I should like to consult the Assembly with a view to proceeding immediately to consider the draft decision contained in <a href="../pdf/A-51-L.70.pdf" class="pdf">document A/51/L.70</a>. In this connection, since <a href="../pdf/A-51-L.70.pdf" class="pdf">document A/51/L.70</a> was circulated only a short time ago, it would be necessary to waive the relevant provision of rule 78 of the rules of procedure. However, I should like to remind members that the text of the draft decision was earlier made available to delegations in the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-51-864.pdf" class="pdf">document A/51/864</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk12-pa02">The relevant provision of rule 78 reads as follows:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg003-bk12-pa03">"As a general rule, no proposal shall be discussed or put to the vote at any meeting of the General Assembly unless copies of it have been circulated to all delegations not later than the day preceding the meeting."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg003-bk12-pa04">I call now on those delegations that wish to comment at this time.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Marrero</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, we appreciate the work that you have done on this issue and the very constructive draft decision that you have put forward. We think that the draft decision represents a very important step in our consideration of the role of non-governmental organizations in the work of the General Assembly, in this case specifically special sessions of the General Assembly and, in particular, the special session on Agenda 21. We commend you also for the important role you played in bringing about the result reflected in the draft decision.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">During the consultations you held on this issue, Sir, my delegation brought to your attention an ambiguity that was contained in the draft decision you circulated, and we indicated that we would review the text and come back to you perhaps with ways of correcting the difficulty that we had with the draft decision. We think that this is a technical issue; substantively, the position that my Government has on this issue coincides with the views that were expressed during the consultations by the Group of 77 and other delegations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">What we are trying to do by the amendments that I am about to offer is essentially to have the draft decision reflect the understanding that we all had about exactly who it is who will be invited to address the plenary of the special session.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">Turning to the text of the President's draft decision, operative paragraph (a) reads,</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">"Decides that major groups, including non-governmental organizations, will be invited to participate in the plenary meeting of the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly in the debate on an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">The problem that we have with this formulation is that it gives the impression, or, is subject to the reading, that "major groups" is larger than "non-governmental organizations" -- such as we know it -- that are allowed to participate in the work of the United Nations. Those are only those that have a status with the Economic and Social Council or are on the roster. During our discussions, we, the Group of 77 and others understood that only those organizations that have Economic and Social Council consultative or roster status would be invited to participate. Again, the President's formulation contains an ambiguity. The purpose of the amendments that my delegation proposes is to clarify that so that it is clearly understood that only organizations and representatives of major groups that have roster and consultative status are invited to participate.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">With that, I would like to read out the minor adjustments that we would make in the draft decision, with your permission, Mr. President.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">In operative paragraph (a), after the phrase "major groups," I would insert the following:</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa09">"as identified in Agenda 21 and represented by".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa10">Following those words we would strike the phrase "including non-governmental". After the word "organizations" we would insert the following:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg004-bk01-pa11">"with consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and on the roster".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa12">The balance of the paragraph, beginning with the word "will" and through the end of the paragraph, would remain as it is. I would like to read out that paragraph as it would read:</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa13">"Decides that major groups, as identified in Agenda 21 and represented by organizations with consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and on the roster, will be invited to participate in the plenary meeting of the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly in the debate on an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa14">Continuing, in operative paragraph (b) we would make a minor adjustment to conform with operative paragraph (a) as revised. We would insert, after the phrase "Decides also that", "representatives of such"; then after "major groups", delete "including non-governmental organizations, that" and insert "who". The paragraph would then read,</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa15">"Decides also that representatives of such major groups who cannot be accommodated in the debate on an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 in the plenary meeting of the nineteenth special session may be invited to address the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the special session".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa16">In operative paragraph (c) we would insert the word "such" before the word "major" and delete the phrase "including non-governmental organizations" in the second line, so that it would read,</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa17">"Invites the President of the General Assembly to extend invitations to representatives of such major groups to participate in the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa18">In operative paragraph (d) we would insert the word "such" before the word "major" in the first line and delete the phrase "including non-governmental organizations" in the second line, so that it would read,</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa19">"Decides that arrangements concerning the participation of such major groups in the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly will in no way create a precedent for other special sessions of the Assembly".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa20">I engaged in consultations with representatives of major groups and other delegations on these proposed amendments. It is my impression that there is understanding of the purpose of what we are offering, and I believe there is some level of support for these changes. I propose them for consideration.</p>

We are in general agreement, but we would find it very difficult to accept the amendment proposed by the Russian Federation. Our position is that these requirements are for the special session. The other issue, that of representation, comes under the subject of the overall reform process. These requirements are for the special session in June.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">My delegation has listened very carefully to the proposals made by various delegations. We support the opinion expressed on behalf of the Group of 77. Furthermore, we suggest, in connection with the proposal of the delegation of the United States of America, and since it was our understanding that the organizations enjoying consultative status with, or on the roster of, the Economic and Social Council are non-governmental organizations, that perhaps we should retain a reference to non-governmental organizations in paragraph (a). Instead of deleting the reference in paragraph (a) to non-governmental organizations, as proposed by the United States delegation, we could say,</p>

We will go along with the other amendments, including the reference to non-governmental organizations accredited to the Economic and Social Council. However, removing the word "special" from paragraph (d) might create problems.</p>

We can live with the amended text that has been proposed by the United States as subsequently amended by Cuba. We have no particular problem with deleting the word "special" from paragraph (d), even though it is perfectly clear from its title that this draft decision is only about the nineteenth special session.

But concerning the proposal by our colleague from the Russian Federation to delete the word "special" from paragraph (d), I would prefer to support the view put forward by our colleague from the Group of 77.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk11-pa01">My impression is that it would be possible to have general support on the basis of the amendments proposed by the United States and Cuba. I am not trying to be discriminatory, but I would like to propose that the Assembly agree to support the amendments offered by the United States and by Cuba, as I see support for these amendments from various quarters. The proposals by the Russian Federation and by Ukraine with regard to the reformulation of paragraph (d) have not gained the immediate support of some parties, and I hope it will be possible for both the Russian Federation and Ukraine to go along with what appears to be a consensus position.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk11-pa02">I do not think that accepting the language as amended would really make a difference to any party concerned. I offered my own formulation, and some members have proposed the reformulation of some aspects of this. I think we have a text that everybody can live with.</p>

It was our intention to clarify that text further, which was the aim of our suggestion that the word "special" be deleted from paragraph (d). We continue to believe that adoption of this draft decision should not set a precedent for any session of the General Assembly, and it must be clear from the text that the draft decision deals specifically with the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">We regret that a number of delegations do not agree with our view on this. It is clear that there are at least two views to be discerned in the Hall this morning. We are willing to seek a compromise, and I would request you, Sir, to suspend the meeting briefly to enable interested delegations quickly to consult among themselves.</p>
