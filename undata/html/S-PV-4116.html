	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan of 14 March 2000 (<a href="../pdf/S-2000-214.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/214</a>), submitted pursuant to paragraph 12 of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1274(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1274 (1999)</a> of 12 November 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes decisive progress in the implementation of the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-510.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/510</a>) achieved due to sequential and persistent efforts of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan and the leadership of the Commission on National Reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes, in particular, the holding on 27 February 2000 of the first multi-party and pluralistic parliamentary election in Tajikistan, in spite of serious problems and shortcomings, as noted by the Joint Electoral Observation Mission for Tajikistan. It notes that the holding of this election the transition period envisaged in the General Agreement is coming to a close. The Council acknowledges a significant achievement of the Tajik parties, which have managed to overcome many obstacles and to put their country on the path to peace, national reconciliation and democracy. It urges the Government and the Parliament of Tajikistan to work towards elections in the future that meet fully acceptable standards as a means to consolidate peace.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction that the United Nations has played an important role in this success. It welcomes the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT), supported by the Contact Group of Guarantor States and International Organizations, the Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Collective Peacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, being instrumental in assisting the parties in the implementation of the General Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council supports the intention of the Secretary-General to withdraw UNMOT when its mandate expires on 15 May 2000. It expects that the Secretary-General will inform the Council about the outcome of his current consultations with the Government of Tajikistan on a role for the United Nations in the period of post-conflict peace-building and consolidation."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2000-9.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2000/9</a>.</p>
