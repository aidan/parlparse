	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council has considered the eleventh and last report of the operation of the multinational protection force in Albania of 11 August 1997 (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-632.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/632</a>), submitted pursuant to the requirement set out in paragraph 9 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1114(1997).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1114 (1997)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council notes with appreciation that the mandate of the multinational protection force, as set out in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1101(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1101 (1997)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1114(1997).pdf" class="pdf">1114 (1997)</a>, has been successfully fulfilled. The presence of the multinational protection force has contributed to the facilitation of safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance in Albania. Its presence has also helped to create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania as part of the efforts of the international community, particularly the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the European Union, to find a peaceful solution to the crisis and to assist international organizations in their role in the electoral process in close cooperation with the Albanian authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council recognizes the role played by the multinational protection force and the Governments of the participating countries under Italian leadership in the full discharge of the mandate in assisting the Albanian authorities and the international organizations involved.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council is of the view that the Albanian people and their authorities bear the primary responsibility for the future of Albania and for restoring normal conditions in the country. The necessary international assistance will be conditional upon Albania's own efforts at achieving reconciliation, security, rehabilitation and economic reform.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"In this respect, the Security Council encourages the international community to assist and support the economic, social and institutional rehabilitation of Albania, and welcomes the steps that have already been taken in this direction, including the preparatory meetings for the Ministerial Conference to be held in Rome in autumn 1997."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-44.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/44</a>.</p>
