	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Security Council Mission to Burundi, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-163.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/163</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the following other documents: <a href="../pdf/S-1995-157.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/157</a>, letter dated 23 February 1995 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the report of the preparatory fact-finding mission to Burundi; and <a href="../pdf/S-1995-185.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/185</a>, letter dated 6 March 1995 from the Chargé d'Affaires <i>ad interim </i>of the Permanent Mission of Burundi to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">Members of the Council have received photocopies of a letter dated 8 March 1995 from the Chargé d'Affaires <i>ad interim </i>of the Permanent Mission of Burundi to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General. This letter will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-1995-190.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/190</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council has considered the reports of its Mission to Burundi which visited Bujumbura on 10 and 11 February 1995 and welcomes the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Mission (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-163.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/163</a>). It expresses its appreciation to the Mission members for their efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council recalls its earlier statements on the situation in Burundi, in particular that of 31 January 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-5.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/5</a>). It remains deeply concerned that a climate of insecurity continues to prevail in Burundi. It condemns the activities of those, both within and outside the country, who seek to nullify the agreed power-sharing arrangements contained in the Convention of Government of 10 September 1994 by resorting to undemocratic methods such as intimidation and incitement to violence, as well as guerilla activities and subversive political activity. Such actions have threatened peace, stability and national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"The Security Council reaffirms its support for the Convention of Government and for the</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk09-pa10">coalition Government established under it. In this connection, it notes the appointment of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet and urges all parties in Burundi to work together to ensure stability in the country.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">"The Security Council reaffirms the view that impunity is a fundamental problem in Burundi, one which seriously endangers security in the country, and stresses the importance it attaches to assistance being given to help strengthen the national judicial system. In this context, it underlines the role that could be played by an international commission of inquiry into the 1993 coup attempt and into the massacres that followed, established in accordance with the Convention of Government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">"The Security Council strongly reaffirms its support for the implementation of the provisions of the Convention of Government calling for the holding of a national debate with the participation of all segments of the society in Burundi, as a means of fostering political dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa13">"The Security Council underlines the importance of assisting the Government of Burundi in its efforts to restore stability and promote national reconciliation. In this context, it encourages the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Government of Burundi, to augment the United Nations presence in the country, in order to assist the Government of Burundi in strengthening the national judicial system, training civilian police forces and establishing an effective administrative presence in the provinces. It commends the important role played by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa14">"The Security Council reiterates that improving the security situation in Burundi must be given high priority. It encourages the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in consultation with the Government of Burundi and in close coordination with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, to reinforce the office he has established in Burundi. Consideration could also be given to the role human rights monitors could play.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa15">"The Security Council also recognizes the significant contribution made by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) military observers. It encourages the OAU, in consultation with the Government of Burundi, to further increase their number and calls upon the international community to assist the OAU in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa16">"The Security Council further calls on all parties in Burundi to cooperate with international observers and other personnel by ensuring unimpeded access to all parts of all parties of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa17">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to keep it fully informed of developments in Burundi. The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa18">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-10.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/10</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa19">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
