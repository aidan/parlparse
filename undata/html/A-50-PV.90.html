	Mr. Sukayri (Jordan)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa01">It is my great honour and privilege to present to the General Assembly the reports of the disarmament and international security Committee, the First Committee. The reports of the First Committee under agenda items 57 to 81 are contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-50-577.pdf">A/50/577</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-50-601.pdf">A/50/601</a>, inclusive. In this connection, I would like to indicate that corrigenda have been issued to documents <a href="../pdf/A-50-585.pdf">A/50/585</a>, <a href="../pdf/A-50-590.pdf">A/50/590</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-50-600.pdf">A/50/600</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa02">This year, the Committee had before it for consideration a total of 25 items, which subsumed 21 sub-items. The Committee concluded its work in 29 formal meetings and seven informal meetings, in a spirit of accommodation, despite the number of complex issues with which the Committee was confronted. Also, with the need for further rationalization of the work and proceedings of the Committee in mind, every effort was made to utilize the conference facilities accorded to the Committee in an efficient and effective manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The Committee devoted nine meetings, from 16 to 26 October, to the combined general debate on all disarmament and international security agenda items. In order to enhance the effectiveness of its work, the Committee at this session once again set aside time for a structured discussion of specific subjects within the framework of a thematic approach, by holding seven informal meetings, from 30 October to 3 November 1995. This phase of the work of the Committee lent a higher degree of coherence to the discussions and made them more focused and action-oriented.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa04">At the current session, the Committee considered a total of 48 draft resolutions, of which two draft resolutions -- A/C.1/50/L.14, entitled "Status of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction", and A/C.1/50/L.15, entitled "Prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices" -- were not pressed to action by their respective sponsors. Of the draft proposals adopted, 24 draft resolutions and one draft decision were adopted by the Committee without a vote; this constituted some 50 per cent of the total number of proposals adopted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa05">During the general debate, Member States raised, and focused on, a plethora of issues in the field of international security and disarmament, ranging from the issue of small arms to the prevention of an arms race in outer space and from bilateral nuclear arms negotiations to nuclear-weapon-free zones. However, the following issues were most widely discussed: The 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was referred to by most delegations that participated in the deliberations. The views on this issue, however, varied, from those who commended the outcome of that Conference in general terms to those who addressed a number of specific issues. Many delegations noted the importance of the indefinite extension of the NPT as a step which had considerably enhanced the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Many others, however, stressed the fact that the indefinite extension had not been the only significant outcome of the Conference. Rather, they drew the attention of the Committee to such issues as security assurances by nuclear-weapon States to non-nuclear-weapon States, the necessity for concluding a zero-yield verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty, and the necessity for the immediate initiation within the Conference on Disarmament of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa06">The Committee adopted a draft resolution on the NPT Conference which took note of the Conference's three decisions, namely, strengthening the review process for the Treaty; principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament; and extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It also noted the resolution on the Middle East adopted by the parties to the Treaty on 11 May 1995.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa07">Other issues that were focused upon during the discussion included continued nuclear testing by nuclear-weapon States other than those that still observe a voluntary moratorium on testing. This constituted one of the most controversial questions, both during the discussion and later on during the consideration of and action on draft resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa08">Another issue of clear significance within the area of nuclear weapons was the establishment, or consolidation, of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Middle East, South Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, a draft resolution entitled "Final text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the Pelindaba Treaty)" was adopted without a vote. The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East continued this year to be controversial in spite of the fact that the title as well as the content of the draft resolution on this subject has this year been considerably improved with a view to finding consensus language.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa09">The general debate in the First Committee also involved such issues as transparency in armaments, where many Member States stressed the importance of improving the operation of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms. Most speakers regarded the Register as a necessary and appropriate step towards confidence-building among States. Various delegations called for the expansion of the scope of the Register to enable it to include nationally manufactured conventional weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. It was noted with regret by some States that the governmental group of experts entrusted with the improvement of the Register's operation had last year failed to achieve its goals.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa10">The Committee's deliberations highlighted other issues such as the ongoing Conference on certain conventional weapons, which is addressing the question of the Protocol on land-mines; a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines; disarmament and development; a regional approach to disarmament; the role of science and technology in disarmament; and the newly introduced question of "Observance of environmental norms in the drafting and implementation of agreements on disarmament and arms control".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa11">Among the controversial issues tackled by the Committee this year was that of convening a fourth special General Assembly session devoted to disarmament. Views varied concerning, <i>inter alia</i>, a specific time-frame for that special session, and no compromise was reached to pave the way for consensus on this issue.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa12">Finally, it should be noted that this year also the question of rationalization of the work of the First Committee enjoyed the support of delegations, and the Committee adopted a decision, based on a proposal introduced by the Chairman of the Committee, to the effect that consultations aiming at further rationalization should be continued until the fifty-second session, when this item would be taken up again by the Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa13">In conclusion, I should like to extend a well-deserved tribute to all the members of the First Committee, whose spirit of cooperation and conciliation made it possible for the Committee to conclude its work at the current session of the General Assembly one day ahead of schedule.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa14">I should like to pay a special tribute to the Chairman of the First Committee, His Excellency Ambassador Luvsangiin Erdenechuluun of Mongolia, whose impeccable mastery of disarmament and international security issues and long-term experience in the field of disarmament and well-known diplomatic skills enabled the Committee to conclude its work successfully.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa15">I should like to thank the Committee's Vice-Chairmen, His Excellency Ambassador Antonio de Icaza of Mexico and His Excellency Ambassador Wolfgang Hoffmann of Germany, for the excellent manner in which they discharged the responsibilities entrusted to them. I should also like to express my appreciation to the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Marrack Goulding, and to the Director of the Centre for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Prvoslav Davinic, for their contribution to the work of the Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa16">I also take great pleasure in thanking the Committee Secretary, Mr. Sohrab Kheradi, whose knowledge and vast experience in the field of disarmament contributed immensely to the successful conclusion of the work of the Committee. I should also like to thank all those who collaborated with him, including Mr. Sattar, Mr. Alasaniya, Mrs. Kulanusorstit and Mrs. Nania.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk02-pa01">In reference to the outer-space resolution before us, I want to affirm that Canada's abstention this year does not represent a lessening of our commitment to ensuring the prevention of an arms race in outer space. It rather stems from our firm conviction that, on a priority basis in 1996, the Conference on Disarmament should focus its resources to the greatest degree possible on the achievement of an early and successful conclusion of the negotiations relating to a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We cannot support, therefore, the establishment of an ad hoc committee as called for in the resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk02-pa02">As the Assembly is aware, over time Canada has been a strong and constant supporter of the discussions at the multilateral level in the Conference on Disarmament on issues relating to arms control in outer space. Canadian policy in this regard has not changed. It remains firmly based on the principle that outer space should remain, as it is now, weapons-free. Activities in the Conference on Disarmament relating to this objective will continue to receive our strong and direct support. It is our firm conviction that, with the successful conclusion of its nuclear negotiations, the Conference on Disarmament should return to pursuing its outer-space mandate in succeeding years.</div>

	Mr. Dejammet (France)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa01"></i>The French delegation would like to recall the reasons for the vote it is going to cast on draft resolution A -- document A/C.1/50/L.3 in the First Committee -- entitled "Nuclear testing". We wish to emphasize why we believe that this text is unfounded, unfair, pernicious and useless.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa02">France supports the conclusion, as early as 1996, of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. France was the first among the nuclear-weapon States to advocate the zero option with respect to nuclear testing -- that is to say, a stringent test-ban treaty prohibiting all testing of nuclear weapons or any other nuclear explosions. France welcomed the fact that most of its nuclear partners rallied to this demand, and it will continue to pursue this objective.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa03">But, in order to uphold the zero-option objective and to plead the cause of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, France had to acquire a system to enable it to verify in the future the reliability of its deterrence capability without having to carry out any more tests, however limited they might be.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa04">In order to acquire this simulation system, which will prohibit all testing of nuclear weapons or any other nuclear explosions, France, like other nuclear Powers, had to complete a very limited nuclear-testing programme.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa05">France will complete this programme in a very short time, for it is intent on abiding by its commitment with respect to the conclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty in 1996.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa06">In doing this, France is acquiring the means to advocate the zero option and is working for a stringent comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa07">In doing this, France is respecting its international commitments. No legal provision, no commitment entered into by France relates to an "immediate cessation of all nuclear testing". For three years now, the international community has been calling on the nuclear Powers to pledge to exercise the utmost restraint. The series of very limited tests which is about to be completed is in keeping with this criterion of utmost restraint.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa08">In doing this, France is not taking any action likely to damage the environment. Ample evidence has been provided to confirm this fact. France has displayed unequalled readiness to promote transparency and cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa09">The present draft resolution seems to us very far removed from the international community's objectives with respect to disarmament. They are reflected in two draft resolutions that are before the Assembly today and that in the First Committee were document A/C.1/50/L.8/Rev.1, entitled "Comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty", and document A/C.1/50/L.17/Rev.2, entitled "Nuclear disarmament with a view to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons". These two texts meet all of the international community's concerns in this field. They are fundamental texts and France supports them fully.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa10">But the premises of draft resolution A/C.1/50/L.3 do not correspond to the law as it stands. The commitment to utmost restraint, adopted as early as 1993 and confirmed this year, was not and is not a commitment to an "immediate cessation". The draft resolution has no legal basis.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa11">Draft resolution A/C.1/50/L.3 calls for immediate cessation, whereas it is common knowledge that the objective of our final testing programme serves the interests of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and it is common knowledge that this testing programme will have ended well before the conclusion of that treaty in 1996. Draft resolution A/C.1/50/L.3 is thus unfounded and unrealistic.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa12">The draft resolution mistakenly gives credence to the idea that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons might not be respected. For this reason, we regard it as pernicious also.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa13">This draft resolution is finally rearing its head in 1995, whereas all the parameters relating to the question of nuclear testing existed in preceding years. But no draft resolution on the immediate cessation of tests has been put before the General Assembly in recent years. So why are we considering this text this year? How could anyone fail to wonder about the real objectives of this draft resolution? How could anyone fail to arrive at the conclusion that there are other motives behind the draft resolution besides that of promoting nuclear disarmament? In this respect, we regard the text as unfair.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa14">On 6 December 1995, France solemnly announced that this final testing programme would be completed by the end of February 1996 -- in other words, in a few weeks' time.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa15">The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency has just granted our request to set up an international committee of experts with the task of establishing, yet again, that the French tests are not harmful.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa16">These two elements, which have arisen since the vote in the First Committee, must be added to all the others that militate against the adoption of the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk09-pa17">That is why France will vote against the adoption of this draft resolution. That is why France will continue on its chosen course. France will have completed the tests in a few weeks, well before the conclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. France will support the zero option in the negotiations on that treaty. France will work for the signing of the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty in 1996 and will continue to work for non-proliferation, global disarmament and peace.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I wish to make a statement in explanation of vote on the draft resolution, "Nuclear testing", that appeared in document A/C.1/50/L.3 in the First Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa02">On the question of nuclear weapons, Malta has a consistent and unequivocal position of strong encouragement and support for all measures aimed at nuclear disarmament. The States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) have urged the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. This policy is an integral part of Malta's overall policy on disarmament issues, where it is supportive of effective measures aimed at reducing the level of all armaments. Malta recognizes and appreciates the endeavours of nuclear-weapon States towards the promotion of peace and stability. We welcome the indefinite extension of the NPT and the nuclear-weapon States' contribution to efforts to reach a comprehensive test-ban treaty.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Within this context, Malta has taken positive note of the solemn announcement made recently by one of the nuclear-weapon States that its current and last series of nuclear tests was to be completed by the end of February 1996, well ahead of the initially announced date of 31 May 1996, and of the commitment made by the same nuclear-weapon State that as from that date it will no longer carry out any nuclear explosion, even prior to the conclusion and signing of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Malta states its understanding that the current draft resolution is aimed at the broader issue of nuclear testing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa04">In casting its vote in favour of draft resolution A/C.1/50/L.3, Malta would like to express its reservation on the fourth preambular paragraph. Malta feels that that paragraph is not a correct reflection of the undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa05">Malta stresses again its desire for the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and acknowledges and welcomes the commitment of all nuclear Powers to the conclusion of this agreement.</div>
