</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="2-13">
<span class="speaker" name="Sir Jeremy Greenstock" nation="United Kingdom" language="">
	Sir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The United Kingdom warmly welcomes this opportunity to introduce the draft resolution before the General Assembly in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.95">A/55/L.95</a>. As this is a joint initiative sponsored with Costa Rica, Ambassador Chassoul will shortly also say a few words by way of introduction. We believe, and I hope that the Assembly will not wholly disagree, that Costa Rica and the United Kingdom together present a passable combination of vision and practicality.</div>
	<div class="p">I am also delighted to announce that the following Member States have now added their names to the list of sponsors of this draft resolution: Bangladesh, Belarus, Gambia, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Paraguay and San Marino.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations International Day of Peace was originally established by General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-36-67">resolution 36/67</a> as a result of the initiative of Costa Rica. It was set to occur on the third Tuesday in September each year, to coincide with the opening of the regular session of the General Assembly. The United Kingdom and Costa Rican Governments have now joined together to strengthen and reinvigorate what we believe is the unique and still largely unfulfilled opportunity for the practical furtherance of peace.</div>
	<div class="p">The need for such an enhanced approach was originally brought to our attention by a United Kingdom-based non-governmental organization, Peace One Day, which, over the past two years, has gained far-reaching support for its campaign from senior political leaders in every continent. What we are collectively hoping to achieve is to take the International Day of Peace beyond its essential symbolism, an aim that is itself symbolic of the programmatic targets that the United Nations has set itself for the new millennium.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe that the meaning and impact of the International Day of Peace should be strengthened to allow the global community as a whole to understand and honour the Day in a fuller, more practical and more significant way. Accordingly, this draft resolution recommends that henceforth the United Nations International Day of Peace be observed as a global ceasefire day, the foundation for a wide-scale and, I hope, unanimous cessation of violent conflict throughout the world for the duration of the Day.</div>
	<div class="p">It further recommends that the United Nations International Day of Peace become a fixed date in the calendar, to avoid the confusion that has arisen in recent years as to when the Day falls, to allow for better planning and publicity and, thus, to encourage broader observance throughout the world. Most important, however -- because most useful to those in need -- it will create a clear and unequivocal window for medical, humanitarian and developmental agencies, both non-governmental and governmental, to provide vital services in comparative safety to civilian victims in areas of conflict. The draft resolution suggests that the Day be fixed as 21 September, reflecting the first-ever United Nations International Day of Peace -- which was 21 September 1981 -- as well as symbolizing the twenty-first century.</div>
	<div class="p">Costa Rica and the United Kingdom jointly commend this draft resolution to our fellow Member States as a step both symbolic and concrete towards our collective ambition to make peace a reality throughout the world 365 days a year.</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="3-2">
<span class="speaker" name="Mrs. Chassoul" nation="Costa Rica" language="Spanish">
	Mrs. Chassoul (Costa Rica)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me, first of all, to thank Ambassador Greenstock for the excellent introduction of the draft resolution he has just made. I would also like to thank him for the leadership of his delegation in promoting this initiative.</div>
	<div class="p">From the beginning of written history, humankind has lived under the shadow of war, destruction and death. Hate and violence reign in the hearts of men. Nations take up arms against one another, and peoples drown in rivers of blood. How many lives have been lost? How many dreams, hopes and expectations have been wasted? How much sadness has been created?</div>
	<div class="p">War, disease, hunger and death are the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Today they continue to threaten human progress. Humankind should grab the reins of its destiny with a firm hand and chart a path towards a better future. This Organization is the beacon that can illuminate that path.</div>
	<div class="p">Humankind is at long last living in circumstances that are propitious to both embracing peace and definitively rejecting war. The shadows cast by the cold war and the arms race have vanished. The veil of ideological confrontation has been lifted, and there is a daily growing awareness of the barbarity of violence, poverty and injustice. Today we have before us a fertile field in which to sow the seeds of peace so that the excesses of destruction and conflict may be replaced by the values of brotherhood, tolerance and cooperation among all people.</div>
	<div class="p">Peace is not created in a day. The promotion of peace requires a continuous effort to create an environment where there is mutual respect and where violence is shunned. Real sustainable peace can be attained only when the conditions of a worthy life are guaranteed for all; when there is a level of economic development that provides for the basic needs of all; when basic human rights are respected; and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic means, dialogue and negotiation. Building a true culture of peace requires that efforts be made in every field. Respect for and promotion of human dignity and the search for the common well-being are essential prerequisites for peace.</div>
	<div class="p">Peace is not created in a single day. Nevertheless, it is both just and essential that we devote a special day every year to commemorate and strengthen the ideal of peace among all nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Exactly 20 years ago, in 1981, Costa Rica worked towards the adoption by the General Assembly of an annual observance of the International Day of Peace. It did so precisely to commemorate and advance these lofty ideals. That initiative was the idea of the President of Costa Rica at the time, Mr. Rodrigo Carazo Odio, a firm believer in the fact that peace can only be built through education, training and example. It was that very commitment that later led President Carazo to establish the University for Peace, an institution of higher education designed to provide training in academic fields that promote peaceful relations between people and nations.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation fully supports the draft resolution introduced on behalf of the sponsors by the representative of the United Kingdom. It provides for setting a fixed date for the commemoration of the day of peace. This will help the preparations for the celebrations and commemoration and at the same time enable all peoples to respect a truce that day. The sponsors are convinced that these measures will make it possible at a later stage for people to recognize the value of peace even more. That will be the first stage towards a solution to existing conflicts.</div>
	<div class="p">We hope that this draft resolution will be adopted with the firm support of all the Member States.</div>

	Ms. Lajous (Mexico)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The Government of Mexico believes that this is an opportune time for the General Assembly to consider the problem of malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa, as a response to the just call made at the African summit meeting held in Abuja in April 2000 and, in so doing, to promote national, regional and international efforts to combat malaria, a disease that stands in the way of development and poverty alleviation in developing countries. Malaria exists in various regions of the world, but 90 per cent of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">Despite the strong negative impact that malaria has had in a number of countries, the problem can be remedied, as Mexico's experience proves. The solution is to be found in simultaneous public health efforts at the regional level. Combating malaria is a task that must be undertaken jointly. The African countries have committed themselves to promoting community participation in activities to roll back malaria; to ensuring that diagnostic services and treatment, including treatment at home, are accessible to the population; and to increasing their vigilance in order to overcome the resurgence of malaria in controlled areas.</div>
	<div class="p">For its part, the international community must allocate substantial resources to assist in rolling back malaria; invest in the development of vaccines against malaria and provide incentives for other anti-malaria technologies; strengthen and finance the work of research institutions and ensure the participation of international specialists; and promote the cooperation of research institutions with the agencies that are implementing the malaria roll-back initiative so as to ensure that full use is made of scientific knowledge and experience gained from other programmes.</div>
	<div class="p">Mexico has established a Centre for Research on Malaria within the National Institute of Public Health. We have more than 20 years of experience and global recognition in basic and functional research on malaria. Our research has led to the development of new strategies for the control of vectors and the control of the transmission of parasites, as well as for ensuring epidemiological vigilance with regard to the disease. Through the use of such strategies, we have achieved levels of control never before attained, with the advantage of reducing the use of insecticides, eliminating DDT in such activities and promoting community participation in the control, treatment and prevention of the disease.</div>
	<div class="p">Mexico would like to make available the expertise and experience of the Centre to assist in the transfer of technology and provide practical treatment in the field, as well as courses specially designed for individuals involved in controlling malaria and programmes, at the masters and doctorate levels within the Institute, for scientific personnel from African countries. We have already done this for Central American countries.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Mexico supports the call of the General Assembly to declare 2001-2010 the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa. We believe that this will give impetus to activities that have already been undertaken by developing countries to ensure that we roll back this disease in various regions of the world, particularly Africa.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I am pleased to introduce the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.93">A/55/L.93</a>, the annex to which contains the outcome of the informal consultations on the improvement of the working methods of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The consultation process, begun at the suggestion of President Holkeri, had as its starting point resolutions 47/233, 48/264 and, in particular, 51/241, all of which relate to the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly, with particular emphasis on the implementation of those provisions agreed upon in the resolutions referred to that have not yet resulted in any specific decisions. As a result, with regard to the agenda of the General Assembly, it is proposed that cooperation items be clustered and biennialized, and that certain substantive items, set out in part II.B of the annex, also be biennialized. At the same time, we need to state that these agreements in no way affect the right of any State to propose any item or issue for consideration by the Assembly, as established in the draft resolution submitted today.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, it was decided to allocate to the Third Committee the consideration of the item on the World Summit for Social Development and the biennial treatment of some items referred to in item II.B of the annex.</div>
	<div class="p">Regarding the consideration of reports by the Assembly, progress was made on implementing the provisions of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241">resolution 51/241</a>, in particular those relating to the annual report of the Secretary-General.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, the annex contains a few innovative proposals related to the General Committee, to the strengthening of the office of the President of the General Assembly, and to the use of information technology.</div>
	<div class="p">The resolution and the annex submitted today for approval by the General Assembly constitute one more step in the already extensive history of the effort to grant to the Assembly the central political role that it should have in the United Nations system. As such, they respond to one of the most heartfelt aspirations of the Member States: to restore to this democratic body par excellence, which allows for the participation of all its members in conditions of equality, the preponderance in international affairs which the drafters of the Charter envisaged for it. The various resolutions adopted by the Assembly in the past pursued the objective of strengthening the United Nations system.</div>
	<div class="p">Through the various processes of debates and agreements, including the establishment of a high-level open-ended working group, in recent years members have adopted resolutions -- such as 47/233, 48/264, 49/252 and 51/241 -- that propose, among other matters, improving the General Assembly's capacity to effectively manage its responsibilities and to fully comply with its mandate. In this way, emphasizing the character of the Assembly as the highest political body with universal representation within this Organization, the consideration of agenda items in plenary was reserved for questions or issues that are urgent or of great political importance. This requires reviewing the agenda and reducing its scope. Without this measure it will be difficult for the Assembly to be effective and to comply with the mandate established in the Charter. To this end, these resolutions authorize the President of the Assembly to evaluate the debates in the various bodies of the system and to carry out effective informal and open-ended consultations to consider, if deemed appropriate, the adoption of measures to make the role of the General Assembly more effective. As we know, the full implementation of these resolutions has not been possible.</div>
	<div class="p">In the fifty-fifth session of the Assembly, which is nearing its end, it has been thanks to the initiative and personal energy of the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Harri Holkeri, that we have been able to respond to these issues in the debate among Member States. I am certain that I am expressing the views in this Hall in saying that all Member States without exception are thankful to him for his personal leadership, devotion and political commitment, as well as for the transparency of the process of consultation which led to this resolution. Allow me, on my own behalf, to express my gratitude for the confidence that the President placed in me in seeking my assistance in this facilitation process, which has led to this new step in the revitalization of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">During our consultations I noted the unanimous agreement of Member States regarding the need to adopt for the General Assembly's work to the demands of today's world, to give greater relevance to urgent political discussions, and to reduce an agenda that dilutes the impact of the Assembly's decisions and discussions and makes it very difficult for the smallest delegations to follow and participate on an equal footing. I am grateful for the cooperation and interest shown by all delegations in the development of the consultation process. We have all noted during these discussions that difficulties arise regarding adapting the agenda and the need to respect the legitimate aspirations of Member States to preserve the items which are of preferential interest to them. Also, we noted the need to continue making progress in this area, and the general agreement to do so.</div>
	<div class="p">These efforts have brought limited results, but the open debate we have had together enables us to visualize other initiatives to revitalize the Assembly and increase the relevance of its debates, not only for the system, but also for the development of the international community.</div>

	<div class="p">Mr. President, I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union.</div>
	<div class="p">To begin with, we would like to thank you and Ambassador Valdés for all your efforts to ensure that we get a resolution on the revitalization of the General Assembly and improving its efficiency, to be found in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.93">A/55/L.93</a>. We welcome the results achieved and are glad that it will still be possible to adopt this resolution under your presidency in the fifty-fifth session. We hope that there will be no delay in the implementation of its provisions. The search for more effective working methods for the Assembly remains a concern for the European Union, and that is why it is our fervent wish that this exercise will be continued at the forthcoming session.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The President: </b>We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.93">A/55/L.93</a>. I give the floor to the representative of the Secretariat.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>Mr. Chen Jian: </b>Should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.93">A/55/L.93</a>, paragraphs 22, 23 and 24 of the annex thereto call for a number of measures for strengthening the office of the President of the General Assembly and for enhancing the use of modern technology in the intergovernmental processes of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p">As regards strengthening the office of the President of the General Assembly specified in paragraph 22 of the annex to the draft resolution, the additional measures for its strengthening would be identified in consultations with the office of the President. The impact of those measures on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 would be assessed on the basis of the experience of the current biennium and taking into account the observations and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions on the issue contained in its report of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 (<a href="../pdf/A-56-7">A/56/7</a>) and reported to the Assembly during the main part of its fifty-sixth session, as requested by the Assembly in paragraph 22 of the Annex to the draft resolution. On that understanding, the proposals contained in paragraph 22 of the annex to the draft resolution would have no programme budget implications on the programme budget of the biennium 2000-2001.</div>
	<div class="p">As regards the need to enhance the use of modern technology and information within the United Nations, including in the intergovernmental processes of the Organization, the scope of the proposals for such enhancing, as detailed in paragraph 24 of the annex to the draft resolution, requires specific evaluation to estimate the related requirements. Such evaluation would be undertaken by the Secretariat during the rest of the year 2001. The results of the evaluation and the related requirements would be reported to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session in accordance with established procedure. On that understanding, the proposals contained in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the annex to draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.93">A/55/L.93</a> would have no programme budget implications on the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001.</div>

	<div class="p">My delegation first wishes to congratulate the facilitators for their very hard work and for this draft resolution which we have just adopted. Canada strongly supports the resolution and the efforts to improve the efficiency of the General Assembly. A number of steps, including the biennialization of items will, we hope, lead us firmly in this direction. My delegation would like to note that certain items -- for example, the situation in Haiti -- while biennialized in this exercise, may have to be revisited in subsequent sessions, should the situation warrant.</div>
	<div class="p">Canada would like to emphasize that we supported the biennialization of this item in spite of this possibility because we feel strongly about the need to improve the efficiency of the General Assembly. We would urge other delegations positively to consider this course of action in future exercises to improve the work of the Assembly, that is, to allow items to be biennialized for the sake of efficiency, secure in the knowledge that should the situation warrant, the item can be reintroduced in the following session.</div>
