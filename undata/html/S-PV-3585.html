	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the 5 October agreement by the Bosnian parties to a cease-fire, including by terminating all hostile military activities throughout the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as of 10 October 1995 provided that fullgas and electrical utility service is restored to Sarajevo. It welcomes all efforts to restore such service and calls upon the parties to cooperate fully with such efforts. The Security Council urges the parties fully to comply with all provisions in the cease-fire agreement once they come into effect.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council also welcomes the decision of the Governments of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to attend proximity peace talks by the end of this month, to be followed by a peace conference. It reiterates that there can be no military solution to the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and strongly urges the parties to negotiate in good faith on the basis of the Geneva Declarations of Principles of 8 September 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-780.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/780</a>, annex II), and the Further Agreed Principles of 26 September 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council also welcomes the 3 October agreement by the Government of the Republic of Croatia and the local Croatian Serb authorities in eastern Slavonia to Guiding Basic Principles For Negotiations. It strongly urges both parties to negotiate in good faith towards a peaceful final settlement to the conflict consistent with the Council's resolutions."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-50.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/50</a>.</p>
