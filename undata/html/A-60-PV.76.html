	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa01"> Accordingly, the General Assembly will now resume its consideration of agenda item 157, entitled "Election of judges of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa02">In his letter (<a href="../pdf/A-60-741.pdf">A/60/741</a>), the Secretary-General informs the Assembly that the President of the International Tribunal has requested that Judge Joaquín Martín Canivell, a national of Spain, be able to continue to serve in the trial in the <i>Krajisnik  </i>case, to which he was appointed as an ad litem judge on 1 May 2003 and which is still ongoing before the International Tribunal, and to see the case through to its completion.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa03">The Secretary-General, in his letter, recalls for the Assembly that Judge Canivell's term of office as a member of the pool of ad litem judges had come to an end on 11 June 2005 and that he was not re-elected as an ad litem judge. However, in response to the requests contained in the Secretary-General's letter of 6 January 2005 (<a href="../pdf/A-59-666.pdf">A/59/666</a>), the Security Council, by its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1581(2005).pdf">resolution 1581 (2005)</a> of 18 January 2005, and the General Assembly, by its decision 59/406 B of 20 January 2005, decided, inter alia, that Judge Canivell, once replaced as an ad litem judge of the International Tribunal, should finish the <i>Krajisnik</i> case, which he had begun before the expiry of his term of office. The Council, by the same resolution, as well as the Assembly, by its decision, took note of the International Tribunal's intention to finish the <i>Krajisnik  </i>case before the end of April 2006, which would have kept Judge Canivell's service at the International Tribunal within the period of three years for which ad litem judges are allowed to serve in trials during their term, pursuant to article 13 ter (2) of the statute of the International Tribunal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa04">The Secretary-General also informs the Assembly that he has been informed by the President of the International Tribunal that the <i>Krajisnik  </i>case is expected to be completed only by August or September 2006. Consequently, the Secretary-General would appreciate confirmation from both the Security Council and the General Assembly that Judge Canivell can continue to sit in the <i>Krajisnik</i> case beyond April 2006 and see the case through to its completion, notwithstanding the fact that the cumulative period of his service in the International Tribunal would then attain and exceed three years.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa05">In his letter addressed to the President of the General Assembly contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-60-476.pdf">A/60/476</a>, the President of the Security Council transmits the text of Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1668(2006).pdf">resolution 1668 (2006)</a>, of 10 April 2006, whereby the Council, inter alia,</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa06">"Decides in response to the request by the Secretary-General to confirm that Judge Joaquín Canivell can continue to sit in the Krajisnik case beyond April 2006 and see the case through to its completion, notwithstanding the fact that the cumulative period of his service in the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia would then attain and exceed three years".

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa07">If there is no objection, I propose that the Assembly decide to endorse that recommendation of the Secretary-General, which was endorsed by the Security Council in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1668(2006).pdf">resolution 1668 (2006)</a> of 10 April 2006.</div>
