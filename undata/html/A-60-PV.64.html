	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk07-pa01">The United States has worked continuously to support the social and economic development, as well as legitimate political aspirations, of the Palestinian people. The level of United States assistance for Palestinians' needs compares favourably to that of any other country in the world. The United States has no quarrel with the "right of the Palestinian people to self-determination". President Bush articulated clearly that the United States objective is two sovereign, democratic States -- Israel and Palestine -- living side by side in peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk07-pa02">The United States, working with the Palestinian Authority and the international community, has focused substantial resources on strengthening the Palestinian Authority's institutions and providing assistance to ensure democratic elections. President Bush recently welcomed Palestinian Authority President Abbas to the White House. Recent progress on the ground, including the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the 15 November Agreement on Movement and Access between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are historic and show that progress is made when Israeli and Palestinian officials work together with the support of the international community. In this regard, the opening of Rafah on 25 November marked an important step in building trust between the parties as we work to renew progress along the road map.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk07-pa03">The United States cannot support the draft resolution under consideration. The draft resolution and others like it reflect an outdated approach conceived when the Palestinian people lacked democratic leadership and believed that the solution to their problems lay in the United Nations. There is a role for the United Nations in this issue, but that role is in supporting the two parties to the conflict. One-sided resolutions from the Assembly undermine the credibility of the United Nations and, ultimately, its effectiveness.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Sin Song Chol" nation="Democratic People's Republic of Korea" language="">
	Mr. Sin Song Chol (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa01">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea categorically rejects draft resolution IV, entitled "Situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea", submitted by the European Union, as a political plot against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by the United States of America and its allies. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea questions the legitimacy of the draft resolution for the following reasons.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa02">First, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea draws the attention of Member States to the fact that the draft resolution was submitted by the kingpins of human rights violations, namely the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa03">As for the United States, it is a criminal State, historically living on war and massacre. At this point, the United States, having occupied sovereign States by force, is indiscriminately killing innocent people by using chemical weapons such as white phosphorus without hesitation. The United States routinely kidnaps innocent people on the pretence that they are terrorist suspects, and tortures them in secret prisons. Now, the President, the Vice-President, the Secretary of State and other high officials of the Administration are all claiming, in defiance of international law, that torture is legitimate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa04">As for Japan, it is a war-criminal State of the Second World War. It has not settled the issue of the crimes against humanity that it committed in the twentieth century. Rather, it embellishes those crimes and is pushing forward with preparations to repeat its criminal history.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa05">Now, Japan has inserted a clause on abductions into the draft resolution and is demanding that the countries of Asia and Africa support it. The abduction issue that Japan is talking about refers to incidents that took place by chance, in the context of the hostile relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Japan in the 1970s. That issue was duly resolved during Prime Minister Koizumi's visit to Pyongyang. The problem is that the conservative hardliners continue to use it politically.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa06">However, Japan's abduction of Korean people has not been settled at all. During its 40-year occupation of Korea, Japan mobilized, by force or by abduction, 8.4 million people for military service, for forced labour at coal mines and to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese army. Japan has so far not given any information on the fate or the whereabouts of those individuals.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa07">Even today, Japan continues to engage in the criminal act of abducting citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In that regard, I am going to announce incidents of Japan's abduction of citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that have not yet been made known to the international community. Japan sends various non-governmental organizations to the border area between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China. Those individuals are engaged in secret operations to lure and abduct Japanese-Korean citizens to take them to the Japanese islands. Some members of those Japanese non-governmental organizations were arrested by the Chinese public security authorities for their illegal activities and were expelled.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa08">I would like to recall that at the normalization talks between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Japan, held in Beijing in early November, we raised that issue with the Japanese side and demanded that our citizens abducted to Japan be sent back to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa09">The United Kingdom, for its part, grew fat on hundreds of years of colonial exploitation and massacre. Today, the United Kingdom's zealous junior collaborator, the United States, wages aggression against sovereign States and violates international law and human rights under the slogan of a war on terror. In that regard, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea makes it very clear that the European Union is nothing less than hypocritical when it poses as a human rights champion. It is cowardly and hypocritical for the European Union to cry for human rights in small and weak countries while turning away from horrible human rights violations committed by the United States and the United Kingdom.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa10">The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea raises the following question: what on Earth do justice, fairness and legitimacy mean when the kingpins of human rights violations are free to use their strength to blame other countries on human rights issues.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa11">Secondly, the draft resolution uses the issue of human rights for political purposes against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The United States, the United Kingdom and Japan are using human rights issues, together with the nuclear issue, to pursue the overthrow of our social system. The United States has enacted the North Korean Human Rights Act and is investing $24 million on the issue of North Korean human rights every year, and innumerable bogus human rights organizations from the United States, Japan, South Korea and European countries are engaging in subversive operations against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea just to get paid from that fund. In that regard, I once again highlight the fact that the draft resolution is based on false information fabricated by those bogus non-governmental organizations. The anti-Democratic People's Republic of Korea manoeuvring by the United States and Japan using human rights issues is itself a violation of human rights and international law.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa12">Thirdly, the European Union's draft resolution damages the authority and the credibility of the United Nations. The United States, the United Kingdom and Japan are pressing developing countries hard to change their position and support the draft resolution. In the Third Committee, many Asian and African countries voted against or abstained on the European Union's draft resolution, based on a principled position against politicization, double standards and selectivity on human rights issues. The United States, the United Kingdom and Japan were alarmed at the result of the vote and stepped up pressure on those countries to change their positions. We feel particularly sick of Japan's desperate campaign to force its will on other countries by exerting its economic influence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa13">All those facts and realities eloquently demonstrate that the draft resolution, even if it is adopted with majority support in the Assembly, would not carry the lofty authority and legitimacy of a resolution of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa14">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a country with a small territory and a small population, whereas the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and the European Union are big Powers boasting military and economic strength. The people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are very proud that they firmly safeguard their sovereignty against the pressure of the united forces of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan and the European Union, and they are resolved to defend and further develop the superior people-centred system that they have chosen by themselves.</div>
