	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1995-657.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/657</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia of 9 August 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-657.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/657</a>) pursuant to its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-993(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 993 (1995)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council notes there has been little overall progress in achieving a comprehensive political settlement and that a stalemate exists with respect to the return of refugees and displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and those of the Russian Federation in its capacity as facilitator aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict, including on the political status of Abkhazia, respecting fully the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia. The Council renews its call to the parties, in particular the Abkhaz side, to reach substantive progress in the political negotiations as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council remains deeply concerned at the continued obstruction of the return of the refugees and displaced persons by the Abkhaz authorities, which is totally unacceptable. Reaffirming its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-993(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 993 (1995)</a>, the Council reiterates its call to the Abkhaz authorities to accelerate the return process significantly, to guarantee the safety of all returnees and to regularize the status of spontaneous returnees, in accordance with internationally accepted practice and in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council welcomes the continuing close cooperation and coordination between UNOMIG and the CIS peace-keeping force in the performance of their respective mandates. It reminds the parties of their obligations to cooperate fully with UNOMIG and the CIS peace-keeping force and to ensure the safety and freedom of movement of all UN and CIS personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council takes note with appreciation of the decision of the Secretary-General regarding the resident Deputy to his Special Envoy. The Council also supports the Secretary-General's efforts with regard to the establishment of a human rights monitoring mission in the area. It encourages the Secretary-General to continue his consultations with the parties to this end."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-39.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/39</a>.</p>
