	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">Under the item on its agenda, the Security Council will now begin its consideration of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members concerning the application of the Republic of Nauru for admission to membership in the United Nations, which appears in <a href="../pdf/S-1999-716.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/716</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">In paragraph 3 of the report, the Committee recommends to the Council that it should have recourse to the provision of the last paragraph of rule 60 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure in order to present its recommendation to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Council wishes to waive the time limits set forth in the penultimate paragraph of rule 60.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">In paragraph 4 of the report, the Committee recommends to the Security Council the adoption of a draft resolution on the application of the Republic of Nauru for admission to membership in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution contained in paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-716.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/716</a>). Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">The Chinese delegation attaches importance to the desire of Nauru to be admitted to membership in the United Nations, and has carried out serious study with regard to its application. In considering the admission of Nauru to the United Nations, we believe it most essential that the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter should be fully complied with, that General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971 should be implemented and that the new Member should fulfil its Charter obligations and comply with General Assembly resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">On the basis of this principled position, the Chinese delegation cannot support the recommendation by the Council to the General Assembly concerning the admission of Nauru to the membership of the United Nations. At the same time, considering the long-term interests of the peoples of China and Nauru, and given the request of South Pacific countries, we will not block this recommendation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">We hope that after it joins the United Nations, Nauru will strictly comply with resolutions of the United Nations, including General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI).</p>

The Council notes with great satisfaction the Republic of Nauru's solemn commitment to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to fulfil all the obligations contained therein. We look forward to the day in the near future when the Republic of Nauru will join us as a Member of the United Nations and to working closely with its representatives."</p>
