	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the delay in the formation of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation (GNUR) as a result of the failure of the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to meet the timetable established by the Joint Commission in the context of the Lusaka Protocol (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1441.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1441</a>, annex).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council also notes with concern the slow pace of implementation of the remaining military aspects of the peace process, in particular, the demobilization and integration of UNITA soldiers into the Angolan Armed Forces.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council takes note of the conclusions of the meeting of the Joint Commission on 23 January 1997, according to which the Government of Angola and UNITA agreed to postpone the inauguration of the GNUR beyond 25 January 1997, UNITA agreed to ensure that all of its National Assembly deputies and the members of the future GNUR designated by UNITA be in Luanda on 12 February 1997, and the Government of Angola agreed to set a date for the inauguration of the GNUR immediately following the arrival of the UNITA deputies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council calls upon the parties to implement this agreement strictly and to form the GNUR without any linkages and without further delay. Failure to implement this agreement could jeopardize the peace process and lead the Security Council to consider appropriate measures, as indicated in relevant Security Council resolutions, against those responsible for the delays.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council emphasizes that the ultimate responsibility for restoring peace rests with the Angolans themselves. The Council reminds UNITA and the Government of Angola that the international community can only provide assistance if progress is achieved in the peace process and that it will consider a United Nations presence in Angola after the expiration of the UNAVEM III mandate in this context.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its appreciation to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the three observer countries for their efforts to assist the parties in Angola in advancing the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council will continue to monitor closely the implementation of the Joint Commission agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council will remain seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-3.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/3</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
