	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">On behalf of the African Group and all the sponsors, I have the honour to introduce, under agenda item 47, draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-60-L.44.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/L.44</a>, entitled "2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">I should like to announce that, since the publication of the draft resolution, the following countries have become sponsors: Angola, Brazil, Djibouti, Egypt, Fiji, Finland, Gabon, Ghana, Lesotho, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Solomon Islands, the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">Africa bears an overwhelming proportion of the malaria burden. The Secretary-General reports that "[u]p to 144 million people in Africa currently live in areas at risk of epidemic malaria" (<i><a href="../pdf/A-60-208.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/208</a>, para. 35</i>). Epidemic malaria is the cause of up to 12 million malaria episodes and between 155,000 and 310,000 deaths per year among people of all ages in Africa alone. Malaria is, however, a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable. It is thus, in the effort to combat malaria as well as to implement the Millennium Development Goals, that the African Group has submitted the draft resolution entitled "2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">The draft resolution is an update of a similar resolution adopted last year on this issue. The draft resolution has been updated to take into account the new developments and measures to combat malaria.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">My delegation wishes to thank the delegation of Tanzania for facilitating the negotiation of the text, and also all Member States that participated in the discussion on the draft resolution. Their contributions have enriched the draft resolution, the implementation of which will facilitate the eradication of that deadly disease. My delegation, in introducing the draft resolution, hopes that, as in previous years, it will be adopted by consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">Delegations may wish to be advised that the following revisions have been made to the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">In operative paragraph 8, the word "and" should appear in the third line between the words "Malaria" and "through country-led initiatives", and a comma should be inserted after the words "adequate international support". The revised paragraph would read as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa08">"Calls upon the international community, inter alia, through helping to meet the financial needs of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and through country-led initiatives with adequate international support, to create conditions for insecticide-treated mosquito nets, insecticides for indoor residual spraying for malaria control and effective antimalarial combination treatments to be fully accessible, including free distribution of such nets where appropriate;".</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I should like to indicate that, since the formal submission of both texts, additional sponsors have signed on to both draft resolutions.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Both draft resolutions are of particular importance to the Group of 77 and China. They both reflect the full importance that the Group attaches to extending support to the African continent. That is in keeping with the special attention that has been given to the special needs of Africa throughout the course of this year. We continue in both draft resolutions to underscore the progress made in the continent, but reiterate more importantly the need for the continued support of the United Nations system and the wider international community in general.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">I should like to indicate some revisions to draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-60-L.16-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/L.16/Rev.1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">In operative paragraph 15, we would delete the words "and of the assessment of the level and extent of aid delivery vis-à-vis pledges". The paragraph would thereby end with the words "on Africa".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">With respect to operative paragraph 19, the word "continuing" should be substituted for the word "continuous".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">With those revisions, I commit to the General Assembly both draft resolutions for adoption by all member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">Before concluding, I should like to extend compliments on behalf of the Group of 77 and China to the facilitator, Mr. Abdellah Benmellouk of Morocco, and to all delegations that participated in the negotiations, thereby enabling the texts to be brought to the Assembly for adoption by consensus.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01">The time has come for me to make a few concluding remarks before we close this part of the work of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly. As I said, I hope that today will be the last day of our work, but since I am not certain of the time of the day when we shall be able to meet again in the plenary to decide the budget, I want to take advantage of the broad presence of representatives in this Hall this morning to say a few words. I trust that they have all received my letter of yesterday reviewing our progress to date on the 2005 world summit follow-up; I will not repeat the details of that letter. It has also been circulated in the Hall today.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa02">As members know, the Fifth Committee has not yet finalized the work on the 2006-2007 budget. I am encouraged by the diligent and constructive efforts that are being made to find solutions, and I am hopeful that during the course of the day we can reach a conclusion on that urgent and absolutely vital issue for the United Nations. We need clearly defined financial conditions guiding our work in the next two years.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa03">I am the first to acknowledge that this has been an unusually intense period of work for the General Assembly. Let us recall that, exactly 100 days ago, our leaders gathered here for the world summit and adopted an ambitious reform agenda for the United Nations. That set the pace and direction of much of our work over the past few months. Since the summit, we have engaged wholeheartedly in the implementation of the reforms, alongside our regular programme of work. I am deeply grateful to all representatives for the energy they have invested in our work and for their willingness seriously to work through the open, transparent and inclusive mechanisms we have put in place for our consultations and negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa04">We have already recorded some important achievements. We have reached agreement on the Peacebuilding Commission. We have expanded and transformed the existing central humanitarian funding mechanism into the new Central Emergency Response Fund. We have adopted the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, and later today we will, I hope, be able take action on the draft resolution on HIV/AIDS, paving the way for an important high-level meeting next year.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa05">Those are achievements of which we should all be very proud. If they are quickly and effectively implemented -- the word "implemented" is important in our Organization -- and effectively supported, they stand to make an important, practical difference to people around the world who rely on the United Nations in their hope for a brighter future. Those achievements are also an early indication to the world that this body, the General Assembly of the United Nations, can and will take difficult but important decisions on the challenges that confront us and the world.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa06">Our achievements so far must also give impetus to our ongoing work on other important reform issues -- the Human Rights Council, development follow-up and reform of the Economic and Social Council, Secretariat and management reform, Security Council reform and the work on counter-terrorism. They should also give us strength as we begin in January to consider further aspects of the summit follow-up, such as system-wide coherence, the environment work and General Assembly revitalization.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa07">I believe, as I stated earlier, that the most valuable and tangible contribution that we can make to revitalizing the General Assembly will be the timely and effective implementation of the world summit outcome. After this fall's work and experiences, I am more convinced than ever about the importance of strengthening the role and relevance of the General Assembly. We represent all the nations and all the peoples of the world. Together, we must reaffirm the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-making and representative organ of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa08">Today, I would first like to express my thanks to all the members of the Secretariat, not least Under-Secretary-General Jian Chen and all the dedicated and hard-working staff in the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management. They have provided us with invaluable support during this first part of the sixtieth session. Nor must we forget all the people who work behind the scenes -- the interpreters, the printers and everyone who makes our work flow so well.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa09">Secondly, I would like to thank our co-chairs, Committee chairs and all the others among us who have played leading roles in our work to date. Some have just brought their work to a conclusion, others are just beginning, but they are united by their skilled approach and strong commitment to their work and their determination to see the United Nations deliver what our leaders asked us to do.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa10">I would also like to thank all our Permanent Representatives, representatives and staff for the noble spirit in which they have worked and for the support they have given me and my Office during these first 100 days. It is deeply appreciated. A particular thanks goes to the excellent group of vice-presidents, who have so skilfully and faithfully helped me lead the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa11">When I was writing these remarks together with my colleagues, we tried to look for other things that had happened in 100 days. In fact, we found that, in the nineteenth century, there was a Chinese emperor who launched 100 days of reform, during which he initiated many bold and ambitious reform processes. The only trouble -- one which made me hesitant to bring up that example -- was that, after 100 days, his aunt, the empress dowager, decided that she had had quite enough and put him in prison for the rest of his life.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa12">In closing, I would like to wish everyone and their families a joyful and peaceful holiday season and a prosperous new year. I trust that we will all -- including our members of the Fifth Committee -- have an opportunity to rest and recharge our batteries over the coming days. I look forward to welcoming everyone back in January to continue our work with renewed energy, determination and belief in this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa13">The Assembly will take up the remaining items as listed in today's <i>Journal</i>, including the reports of the Fifth Committee, as soon as the Fifth Committee has finished its work.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa04">Our initial response to HIV/AIDS was slow, but we must make 2006 the year when the international community finally steps up to the plate. We need to focus on education, gender and health. I was glad that the General Assembly's recent summit outcome document (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/1</a>) included provisions on health systems capacity and that the Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on enhancing capacity-building in global public health (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-35.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/35</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa05">The draft resolution I am introducing today, entitled "Preparations for and organization of the 2006 follow-up meeting on the outcome of the twenty-sixth special session: implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS", paves the way for the comprehensive review of progress in implementing the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and for the high-level meeting to be held in May and June 2006. Further, it responds to the commitment undertaken by our leaders at the 2005 world summit to fully implement all the commitments established by the Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa06">Let me just extend my sincere thanks to Ambassador Christopher Hackett of Barbados and Ambassador Laxanachantorn Laohaphan of Thailand for their skilled and committed co-chairing of the informal consultations which produced this draft resolution. And, of course, I want to pay tribute to all delegates for reaching agreement in the consultations. We all know that there was difficulty finding common ground on some sensitive issues. That spirit of compromise is much appreciated.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa07">In closing, I should note that high-level attendance will be critical to the success of the proposed meeting next year. If draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-60-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/L.43</a> is adopted today, I would strongly encourage high-level representation at the meeting from as many Member States as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa08">Before giving the floor to the representative of Cuba, who wishes to speak in explanation of position on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-60-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/L.43</a>, I remind delegations that explanations of vote or position are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">When the 2005 World Summit Outcome (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/1</a>) was adopted, our delegation clearly indicated its dissatisfaction with the section on various questions related to the international development agenda. We made clear our reservations with respect to the text of the outcome document, whose adoption was marred by a lack of transparency and by manipulation on the part of certain very powerful delegations. No substantive progress was made in terms of the commitments undertaken in United Nations summits and conferences. Nor were we able to reaffirm the outcomes of those summits and conferences.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">While the outcome document affirms that the agreed commitments of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS of the twenty-sixth special session, held in 2001, will be fully implemented, it then immediately undermines those agreed commitments: the goal of universal access to treatment for all those who need it is reduced to the mere aim of coming as close as possible to that goal by 2010. But we all know that to halt the pandemic, urgent and effective action must be taken now.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">It is clear that the guardians of the neo-liberal marketplace are more concerned about the profits of the major pharmaceutical corporations than about the lives of millions of human beings who suffer the consequences of HIV/AIDS. The families of the some 300 people who will die -- as you, Sir, said -- in the next hour should be aware of that.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">With the adoption of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-60-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/L.43</a>, on preparations for the meeting to be held next year, the General Assembly is about to repeat the error it made in September 2005. Our delegation will therefore not join the consensus on the draft resolution, and it disassociates itself from the draft resolution's language on universal access to treatment for all those that need it, contained in paragraph 12, which repeats the step backwards taken by paragraph 57 (d) of the September 2005 summit outcome document. Furthermore, that language prepares the way for diluting other development goals in public health and other areas that are not of interest to big business.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">Our country will continue to oppose the obstacles put in the path of the sustainable development of developing countries.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk05-pa01">Our delegation did not oppose the consensus on <a href="../pdf/A-60-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/L.43</a>, but it believes it necessary to make the following statement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk05-pa02">One of the many reasons for which the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela did not accept the 2005 World Summit Outcome (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/1</a>) was because of the considerable step backwards in the area of the fight against HIV/AIDS that it would legitimize. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela sees the new language accepted by some heads of State or Government -- by which the commitment is solely to come as close as possible to the goal of universal access to treatment by 2010 for all those who need it rather than a firm commitment to ensure access for all to antiretroviral treatment -- as a step backward and a failure to implement the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk05-pa03">We urge the entire international community to keep the Millennium Declaration commitments alive and not limit the goals set in 2000 by means of this new, not very encouraging language. We also hope that this step backwards in the fight against the scourge of HIV/AIDS does not set a precedent that allows the most powerful countries of the international system to reduce the other Millennium Development Goals to their bare minimum.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk05-pa04">For those reasons, we express our reservations with respect to the third preambular paragraph and operative paragraph 12 of the draft resolution.</p>

We also wish to reaffirm our commitment to stopping genocide wherever it may occur and to supporting outreach programmes for all citizens and countries that have suffered that monstrous crime. That is why we are joining the consensus on this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk05-pa03">We have devoted substantial monetary and human resources to a wide range of programmes in Rwanda, in areas ranging from democracy and governance to health, HIV/AIDS, rural economic growth and food security. Some of those programmes are dedicated to advancing justice and reconciliation at the local and national levels. Of particular relevance to the draft resolution is the fact that we provide funding for the Genocide Survivors Fund, which awards scholarships to survivors. In addition, we provide 25 per cent of the funding for the Criminal Tribunal to try and sentence the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide. These are significant contributions that testify to the strength of our commitment to fighting genocide and to bringing the perpetrators to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk05-pa04">Our position on operative paragraph 5 reflects our conviction that the enhanced authority, efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations depends in part on budget reform.</p>

In addition, I would like to warmly thank my fellow Bureau members and all my other colleagues in the Fifth Committee, with whom it is always a truly enjoyable experience to work. At one point, I actually thought that experience would never end. Many thanks go also to Mr. Rajat Saha, Chairman-elect of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. And I would like to thank for their very pleasant company all of those next to whom I have had the privilege and honour to be seated on the podium of Conference Room 3.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk08-pa01">I have the pleasure to speak on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk08-pa02">Tonight's agreement is a good outcome for the United Nations. We have a two-year budget with substantial resources and an assessment for one year, which means that all Member States are expected to make contributions as required by the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk08-pa03">The European Union has been actively involved in negotiations, and we hope that we have played our part in bridging the differences which did exist. The budget and the associated resolutions bring together the different challenges facing the United Nations, many of which were set out in the summit outcome document. We have recently made some modest progress on implementation of that document. Next year the European Union looks forward to much more progress as we work together to fulfil our commitments.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk08-pa04">Management reform is for all of us a priority, and the summit has set a timetable for us, so those results should be available when we come to consider the request by the Secretary-General for the expenditure authority for the second tranche envisaged for 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk08-pa05">In working on the discussions on paragraph 3 of the budget appropriation resolution, the negotiators were agreed on the importance of the budget permitting the continuous functioning of the United Nations, but, equally, it was acknowledged that the Secretary-General's request would be treated on its merits, with no automaticity.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk08-pa06">The European Union will continue to work actively with colleagues next year in order to achieve the necessary reforms and to make the progress expected of us as set out at the summit. We are confident that the Assembly will generate progress on these aspects to build on what we have achieved tonight and that therefore the budget in its entirety will be implemented as we would expect.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk08-pa07">Mr. President, if I could end on a personal note and thank you not just for your leadership on this particular issue but also for having given up the possibility of getting home to Sweden for Christmas in order to make sure that this went through.

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Neil</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa01">The Group of 77 and China agreed to the adoption, without a vote, of the resolution on the biennium budget for 2006-2007 and the accompanying appropriations resolution. However, we have to express some serious concerns and reservations.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa02">First, as to process, as you yourself have said frequently, Mr. President, negotiations and decision-making in the United Nations should be conducted in the context of an open, transparent and inclusive process. To that end, there are established arrangements through the Committee structure. Unfortunately, what happened on this occasion did not meet the required high standards. The process was conducted in a closed group, behind closed doors.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa03">We recognize the constraints of time and of pressures to complete consideration of the agenda and especially to adopt a budget for the biennium. It was a critical objective that needed to be fulfilled in order to avoid plunging the Organization into a crisis. But it is, unfortunately, becoming all too frequent for negotiations and decision-making to take place in a closed group.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa04">These procedures have to change; otherwise, the integrity of consensus decisions will be open to question. On this occasion, there was considerable dissatisfaction in the Group of 77 and China at the bypassing of the Fifth Committee in the negotiation of the budget.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa05">Secondly, as to substance, we are pleased that we were able to arrive at a consensus on a budget for the next biennium. We believe that it is a good budget, and those in the negotiations contributed to a good outcome. The Group of 77 and China negotiated constructively, in good faith, throughout the process towards achieving that result and made many compromises and gestures to accommodate other parties.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa06">However, we have to express our gravest reservations at the inclusion in paragraph 3 of the appropriations resolution of a spending limitation of $950 million. This has nullified to a great extent the fruits of our efforts, because it effectively reduces the biennium budget to a six-month budget. It is a serious aberration in our budgetary arrangements for such a spending limitation to be imposed on the Secretary-General. Worse is the purpose, which is to apply pressure on Member States to act under the pain of deprivation of funding for the Organization. This is contrary to the spirit of the Charter, which requires Member States to fulfil their obligations with regard to the financing of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa07">The introduction of conditionalities into the system through the control of the purse is a very troubling and regrettable tendency. As it has consistently stated and demonstrated, the Group of 77 and China supports reform for better management and improved efficiency in the Secretariat. Our heads of Government have pledged their support, and our delegations are working towards fulfilling that commitment. We will not always agree on all proposals, and we will continue to judge proposals on their merits.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa08">Unfortunately, a veritable sword of Damocles has now been placed over our heads in the form of a threat to United Nations financing, coming from the largest contributors to the budget. That is why, in many respects, this is a sad occasion for us.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa09">The Group of 77 and China 77 rejects conditionalities, and we oppose the imposition of the spending limit on the Secretary-General. But we were faced with a very difficult choice. We did not wish to risk a serious financial crisis for the Organization, which would have resulted from the failure to adopt a budget. We therefore decided not to call for a vote on the imposition of the spending cap, despite our strong objection.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk10-pa10">The Group of 77 and China wishes to state, for the record, that we regard this action as an exceptional measure which should not be treated as a precedent. It should never be repeated. We wish also to state that it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honoured when the Secretary-General makes his request in mid-year 2006.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Oshima</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, the delegation of Japan welcomes the adoption of the 2006-2007 biennium budget by consensus. We thank you for your strong leadership, under which negotiations leading to its adoption by consensus were conducted. Many delegations participated actively in the budget negotiations and made important contributions.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa02">In that regard, I wish to note with appreciation the key role played by Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry of the United Kingdom and Ambassador Stafford Neil of Jamaica, Chairman of the Group of 77.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa03">Incorporating the early harvest results of the summit outcome document into the biennial budget has been a complicated process. The position that my delegation has taken throughout this process reflects our deep commitment to the reform of our Organization and our conviction that this must be achieved early in the current session of the General Assembly. It is our expectation that in the next six months or so, we will, and must, make substantial progress on management reform issues. Our progress will have to be assessed and reflected appropriately in the process of reaching a General Assembly decision on the adjustment to the budget. To ensure this, we needed a mechanism that would enhance our discussions in the early part of next year.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa04">The agreed compromise solution we have reached for such a mechanism is unique and, we believe, shows the collective determination of the entire membership that we all are serious about reform.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa05">It is my delegation's understanding that paragraph 3 of the appropriations resolution does not mean automaticity of approval of the Secretary-General's request for spending authority. Neither should this paragraph be seen as a conditionality in order to force any budget decision. Rather, my delegation regards the compromise solution as concrete evidence of Member States' firm determination to realize, in good faith, the implementation of United Nations reform, as our leaders resolved at the September summit. We welcome the adoption of the budget and intend to participate actively and constructively in all of the reform discussions beginning early next year.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kumalo</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">My delegation joined the consensus today despite our serious reservations about the process that led to the agreement on this budget. We agreed to it only because we believe in the ideals for which the Organization stands. We did so because we support the reform efforts upon which we embarked in September.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa02">However, we wish to state very, very clearly that there should be no illusion that we will be able to support such an action in the future, because we believe that it is totally exceptional. We will not allow the budget to be used as a means to abolish mandates that we support and that fall outside the scope of the summit decision. We do not believe that anything can prevent us from making certain that the Organization acts in the interests of both the developed and the developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa03">Most persuasive to us was the fact that the Secretary-General himself told us that he could live with this budget, albeit with great reluctance on the part of the Secretariat. We joined the consensus so as to ensure that the United Nations is provided with a realistic budget and predictable resources in the coming years. However, in placing conditionalities on expenditure, we have failed to live up to our responsibility. We are concerned by the impact that this political decision will have on the functioning of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa04">There is a misperception regarding the reform agenda being pursued by some Member States -- that only they can force others to accept their vision of reform, by resorting to coercive measures. That is clearly undesirable and not conducive to a transparent process and an honest attempt to adopt reform measures. South Africa supports United Nations reform, but we believe in the equality of all Member States, despite our different levels of contribution to the Organization's resources.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa05">On a personal note, Mr. President, let me wish you the best of whatever little holiday is left. I am delighted to be going back to my grandsons, who have been waiting for me all this time.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wolff</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">The United States welcomes today's General Assembly decision to approve budgetary arrangements that will permit ongoing United Nations operations and activities while Member States continue discussions on implementing the reforms they agreed to during the September 2005 world summit.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">The agreement establishes a biennium budget with a first-year assessment in which the Secretary-General is authorized to spend $950 million -- or about six months of expenditures -- pending further action by the General Assembly. That decision provides the United Nations with sufficient resources to continue its operations, while underscoring the collective commitment by Member States to achieve a stronger, more effective and more accountable Organization. These reforms, therefore, are in the interests of every Member State.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">Today's agreement also provides for the establishment of an ethics office with adequate resources to commence its important functions, for the conduct of an independent external evaluation of United Nations auditing and oversight systems in order to identify measures for strengthening those important systems, and for the creation of an independent audit advisory committee. These are all critical achievements reflecting our shared objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">The United States also stands ready to continue deliberations with our colleagues, as well as with Secretariat officials, on the best ways to make more progress on the other reforms agreed at the summit, including the comprehensive review of United Nations mandates and the assessment of human resources and budget regulations.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">It is clear that in six months, we can assess progress on management reform issues and then decide how to address resource questions for the remainder of 2006. We have the ability -- which the negotiators of the resolutions have acknowledged -- to refrain from joining consensus on the next budget decision.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa06">We earnestly hope, of course, that progress on reform measures will be more than sufficient to support a continuation of the budget for the remainder of 2006. All of these improvements will strengthen the Organization and increase its credibility so that it can better carry out the priorities that Member States have agreed to.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa07">The United States looks forward to our continued collective engagement on these matters.</p>

	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">Like others, let me thank you, Mr. President, for giving up your Christmas with your family.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa02">I am delighted tonight to speak on behalf of the CANZ group of countries -- Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- which obviously welcomes the consensus that has been achieved. In the interests of brevity, however, let me, like Stafford Neil, simply speak for the record and, in so doing, associate CANZ with the statements made by the representatives of the United Kingdom -- on behalf of the European Union -- Japan and the United States. They expressed the hope that the adoption of the budget will signal a strong continuing commitment to reform and follow-up to the commitments made by our leaders at the summit. In that vein, it must be clear, therefore, that CANZ does not regard our budget undertaking as entailing any automatic commitment or agreement to expenditure proposals for the remainder of 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa03">I could speak at greater length and deliver that message less precisely, but, in the interests of getting out of here, let me just stop at that point.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Iosifov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">From the very outset of the negotiations, the Russian delegation consistently advocated the adoption of a full-fledged United Nations budget for the next biennium. The adoption of a 2006-2007 budget will contribute to the Organization's efforts to implement the extremely important reforms -- including in the area of management -- proceeding from the decisions agreed at the 2005 summit.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">We emphasize once again the urgent need to continue the reform process in order to enhance and strengthen the accountability of the Secretariat to Member States.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Abdelaziz</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa01">Now that we have adopted the United Nations biennium budget without a vote, my delegation, in addition to fully subscribing to the remarks made by the Chairman of the Group of 77 and China, would like to highlight some important aspects that determined -- and will continue to determine -- our position in dealing with budget-related issues.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa02">First, while we support the full and speedy implementation of the agreed reforms set out in the 2005 outcome document (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/1</a>), we do not believe that the United Nations budget should be held hostage to the implementation of those reforms. In our view, the United Nations is much bigger than reform, and we should always ensure together that the United Nations gets the necessary funds to enable it to honestly and objectively carry out all the mandates adopted by its Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa03">Secondly, the setting of a cap on the Secretary-General's authorization to spend from the budget in 2006 is on an exceptional basis and should not constitute a precedent to followed at any time in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa04">Thirdly, we stress the need to maintain the necessary balance among the activities of the General Assembly, the Fifth Committee, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and other organs dealing with United Nations budgetary and financing issues, particularly in addressing the reform process.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa05">Fourthly, we look forward to the approval, without any reservations or conditionalities, of further spending authority when the Secretary-General submits his request. We caution against mixing the consideration of such spending authority with the positions taken on reform proposals or progress achieved on such proposals -- particularly those related to mandate review, which we do not and should not consider as a cost-cutting measure rather than as a measure to enhance the Organization's effectiveness and validity.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Núñez Mordoche</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">First of all, my delegation fully supports the statement made by the Chairman of the Group of 77.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa02">Only a few months ago, when our heads of State or Government were gathered to discuss the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, we all witnessed how United Nations reform hijacked the discussion of that important subject. Unfortunately, we remain in the shadow of that exercise. Once again, reform of the Organization has been used to hijack the necessary consideration and intergovernmental discussion of the Secretary-General's programme budget proposals for the biennium 2006-2007, in accordance with the main contributor's political agenda. The General Assembly was obligated to consider those proposals on their own merits, given its role in the allocation of the resources necessary to ensure the full implementation of all mandates that it itself has adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa03">My delegation reiterates that the reform process is in no way linked to the Organization's budget, and we will engage in all negotiations next year on the basis of that understanding. We hope that these will take place in a truly open, participatory, transparent and democratic atmosphere.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa04">My delegation decided to join the consensus on this resolution out of solidarity with the Group of 77. The distorted negotiating exercise that took place outside of the procedures established for the work of the Fifth Committee precluded discussion of important reports and proposals before us for consideration. In view of that fact, my delegation reserves the right to revisit any issues that were not properly considered and on which no concrete action was taken on this occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa05">I should like to refer briefly to the text that we just adopted regarding the revised budget estimates, particularly those relating to section 23, on human rights. My delegation reiterates its reservations about the approval of posts whose mandates have not been properly adopted by the General Assembly in accordance with operative paragraphs 4 and 5 of draft resolution A/C.5/60/L.25, just adopted. My delegation will revisit this issue in order to negotiate and adopt the programme narratives in question, both in the Committee for Programme and Coordination and in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa06">With regard to paragraph 11, we should like to point out that any budgetary discretion for the Secretary-General must be accompanied by clear responsibility and accountability mechanisms. We also reaffirm the role of the Fifth Committee as the main General Assembly organ responsible for administrative and budgetary issues. We will take care to ensure full compliance with that principle in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa07">My delegation wishes to conclude by indicating that we will ensure that no attempt is made to use this resolution's adoption as a means of blackmailing the Organization. The United Nations cannot be at the mercy of the political agenda of a single country; it must serve the legitimate interests of all Member States.</p>

	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">During the past few weeks, we witnessed once again a negotiating process that called into question the Organization's most fundamental principles. We worked hard to achieve the adoption of a budget -- an issue that should have been discussed at a mainly technical level through procedures that gave all Member States an opportunity to define their priorities and interests.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">On the contrary, however, we witnessed a process whose outcome will reflect only the interests of those who, because of the amount that they contribute, feel that they own the Organization and threaten to create a financial crisis if their unilateral demands are not met. That kind of procedure has become the norm, which is gradually changing the United Nations into an instrument by which the Organization's most powerful countries can exercise control.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">Once again, we have witnessed the adoption of a resolution that many define -- or wish to define -- as consensual. Nothing could be further from the truth. We recall the metaphor used by a well-known North American writer who spoke of the "Dracula effect", meaning that this kind of agreement can take place only in darkness. The outcome of a transparent procedure would be very different.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">My delegation reiterates once again its total and complete reservations regarding the 2005 summit outcome document (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/1</a>), which has no legal or political validity for our delegation and therefore produces no obligation or mandate for the Republic. In that connection, my delegation expressly places on record its disagreement with the first preambular paragraph and operative paragraphs 5 and 13 of draft resolution A/C.5/60/L.25.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk07">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa01">We have now moved from 23 to 24 December; it is Christmas Eve. At 10.30 a.m. yesterday, I said that I was hopeful that during the course of the day we would be able to reach a conclusion on an urgent and vital issue for the United Nations: the budget for 2006-2007. I said that we needed clearly defined financial conditions to guide our work over the next two years.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa02">I want to thank members for the work that they have done -- those who laboured in the Fifth Committee, as always to the very last minute before the holidays, as I recall from my years as Permanent Representative, and, of course, all those who were involved in making it possible for us to adopt the budget for the next two years.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa03">I understand from comments that have been made that hard choices had to been made with regard to both substance and process, where severe time pressures have certainly played a role. We now have a foundation for our work. We must continue our regular work and, at the same time, in a determined way, implement what our leaders decided in September. I will, to the maximum, continue to work in an open, transparent and inclusive manner, as set out at the beginning of our work. We are also required to deliver and to produce results in an open, transparent and inclusive manner, as we were asked to do by our leaders.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa04">I will not speak for long, because I said a few words this morning. But I think that, as we look back at this autumn, we can say that we have achieved a great deal. We have taken a decision on the Peacebuilding Commission; we have expanded the central emergency fund and transformed it into the Central Emergency Response Fund, with new qualitative and quantitative development. We have adopted an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; and we have taken action on the draft resolution on HIV/AIDS, paving the way for an important high-level meeting next year.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa05">But we have important and difficult work ahead. We have to continue to work on the Human Rights Council. Starting on 11 January next year, we will have to continue with development follow-up and the reform of the Economic and Social Council. Tonight we have been talking a great deal about Secretariat and management reform issues. Other issues, including Security Council reform and counter-terrorism, are on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa06">I believe that the most valuable and tangible contribution to revitalizing the General Assembly will be to effectively implement the World Summit Outcome (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/1</a>). In the light of our work and experiences this autumn, I am more convinced than ever about the importance of strengthening the role and the relevance of the General Assembly. We represent all the nations and peoples the world. Together -- that is perhaps the most important word in the English language and, indeed, in all of the languages represented here -- we must reaffirm the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations, as our leaders phrased it during the meeting in September.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa07">So at this, the end of the working season and the beginning of the holiday season, I thank all the members of the Secretariat who have helped us in our work in the General Assembly this autumn. I thank the Co-Chairs of the various plenary consultations, the Committee Chairs and others who have worked so hard to bring about results of which we should be proud.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa08">I thank all Permanent Representatives and their staff in the various Missions for their hard work and the quality of the work done. Particular thanks goes from me to the Vice-Presidents, who have so skilfully and faithfully helped me to lead the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa09">I tried out a joke on my colleagues this morning when representatives were in the Fifth Committee. It did not really get across, but I will try it again. When my staff were preparing my remarks, which is always a risky business, they tried to find out about things that had happened in exactly 100 days: yesterday it was 100 days since the beginning of the summit meeting. They found out that, in the nineteenth century, there was a Chinese emperor who launched 100 days of reform, during which he initiated many bold and ambitious reform processes. The only trouble was that -- and this is serious -- after 100 days, his aunt, the empress dowager, decided that she had had quite enough of him and put him in prison for the rest of his life. I hope that that will not be the case for the President of the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk07-pa10">In closing, I would like to wish all members and their families a joyful and peaceful holiday season and a prosperous and successful new year. I trust that we will all have an opportunity to rest and recharge our batteries over the coming days. I look forward to welcoming members back in January to continue our work with renewed energy, determination and, above all, belief in the Organization.</p>
