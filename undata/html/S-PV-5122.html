	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council received a briefing from the Secretariat on the situation in Lebanon on 15 February 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council unequivocally condemns the 14 February 2005 terrorist bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and others and caused serious injury to dozens of people, including former Minister Basil Fleihan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the people and Government of Lebanon and to the victims and their families.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Council calls on the Lebanese Government to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of this heinous terrorist act and notes the Lebanese Government's commitments in this regard. The Council urges all States, in accordance with its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1566 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>, to cooperate fully in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council is gravely concerned by the murder of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon and its possible impact on ongoing efforts by the people of Lebanon to solidify Lebanon's democracy, including during the upcoming parliamentary elections. Such a terrorist act should not jeopardize the holding of these elections in transparent, free and democratic conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council is concerned by the potential for further destabilization of Lebanon, and expresses hope that the Lebanese people will be able to emerge from this terrible event united and to use peaceful means in support of their long-standing national aspiration to full sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council reaffirms its previous calls upon all parties concerned to cooperate fully and urgently with the Security Council for the full implementation of all relevant resolutions concerning the restoration of the territorial integrity, full sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to follow closely the situation in Lebanon and to report urgently on the circumstances, causes and consequences of this terrorist act."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-4.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/4</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
