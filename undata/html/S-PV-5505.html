	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Côte d'Ivoire, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to documents <a href="../pdf/S-2006-516.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/516</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2006-584.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/584</a>, containing letters from the Secretary-General dated 12 July and 26 July 2006, respectively.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council affirms its commitment to the implementation of the peace process and of the road map established by the International Working Group (IWG). It welcomes the initiatives of the Prime Minister, Mr. Charles Konan Banny, and the ongoing dialogue among President Laurent Gbagbo, the Prime Minister and all other Ivorian parties.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the Prime Minister. It welcomes his determination to implement the decisions taken by all Ivorian parties at the high-level meeting held in Yamoussoukro on 5 July 2006. It strongly encourages him to continue his efforts and demands that all Ivorian parties cooperate with him fully and in good faith.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the launch of the mobile courts throughout Côte d'Ivoire and the Prime Minister's announcement of the completion of the pre-cantonment of the Defence and Security Forces of Côte d'Ivoire and of the Armed Forces of the Forces nouvelles. The Security Council further welcomes the establishment of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) Monitoring Group, the measures taken to implement the quadripartite control of pre-cantonment operations and the beginning of operations to dismantle and disarm the militias. It takes note of the signing of a presidential decree allowing the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to propose any technical adjustments to the electoral code for the transitional elections.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its concern that the IEC's structures have not been deployed throughout the country as well as the local offices of the National Commission of Supervision of the Identification. It urges the Ivorian parties to settle these issues without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council strongly condemns the obstructions to the normal functioning of the mobile courts which followed the calls for such action made by political leaders, in particular the Chairman of the FPI and the President of the former National Assembly. It notes that the procedures of the mobile courts were decided in consultation with President Laurent Gbagbo. It urges all parties to ensure that the mobile courts function without further hindrance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council expresses its utmost concern and condemns the acts of violence committed by organized groups, in particular the Young Patriots, which led to the deaths of civilians, and further condemns the attack of 24 July against the High Representative for the Elections, despite the presence of the Republican Guard at the scene.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council condemns also the incidents of 15 July at the premises of the Radio Télévision Ivoirienne (RTI). It calls on the Ivorian authorities to strengthen security measures at RTI. It underlines the importance of guaranteeing the independence and neutrality of the media in Cote d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council reaffirms its support for the implementation of measures against those responsible as provided for in paragraphs 9 and 11 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1572(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1572 (2004)</a> and underlines that the reports of the events described above will be examined by the Sanctions Committee established by paragraph 14 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1572(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1572 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council demands that the Defence and Security Forces of Côte d'Ivoire, including the Republican Guard, act within the law of the land at all times to ensure full security of the population, including foreigners, and support the implementation of the road map led by the Prime Minister. It reaffirms in this regard paragraphs 8 and 9 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1633(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1633 (2005)</a>. It recalls that the Defence and Security Forces and the Forces nouvelles must ensure the security of the mobile courts hearings in the areas under their control.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council demands also that all Ivorian parties cooperate fully in the operations of the Impartial Forces, in particular by guaranteeing the safety, security and freedom of movement of their personnel, as well as associated personnel, throughout the territory of Côte d'Ivoire, and affirms that any obstacle to their freedom of movement or to the full implementation of their mandates will not be tolerated. It recalls paragraph 4 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1643(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1643 (2005)</a> in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council reaffirms the importance of the concomitant implementation of the identification and DDR operations and of the acceleration by all Ivorian parties of the implementation of the road map in order to create the conditions indispensable for the holding of free, open, fair and transparent elections within the agreed timetable.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">"The Security Council therefore considers that it is necessary to deploy throughout the territory of Côte d'Ivoire as many mobile courts as possible towards the objective of 150 mobile courts called for in the Prime Minister's plan and to complete the second phase of the DDR programme, the cantonment of combatants, before the next meeting of the IWG. It encourages the Prime Minister to take all the necessary actions to this end, with the agreement of all Ivorian parties, as well as for the organization of the elections. It calls on the IWG to monitor such progress and to report to it on its assessment of the progress made.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the IWG and endorses its ninth communiqué, dated 20 July 2006. It reiterates its full support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the High Representative for the Elections."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">This statement will be issued as document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-37.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/37</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
