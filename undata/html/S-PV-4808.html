<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Duclos</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I would like to reaffirm our conviction that the success of the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq and, hence, its stability, require the United Nations to play a dynamic role in the post-conflict management of the country. The resolution that we have just adopted does not, and is not intended to, correspond with that goal. In particular, we would like a timetable to be established with regard to the sequence of the political transition -- in keeping with one of the proposals of the Secretary-General -- which should facilitate the stabilization of Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The resolution that has been adopted today does, however, meet certain specific needs that the Council has been identifying for some time -- needs that were formulated by the Secretary-General himself in his July report. We note that in deciding to establish the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, the Security Council is reinforcing United Nations activities in Iraq and the work of the Special Representative by giving them the necessary means to discharge their mandate. That is why France voted in favour of the resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk09">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Negroponte</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">The text that we have just adopted as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1500(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1500 (2003)</a> deals with two specific issues: the Governing Council of Iraq and the United Nations Assistance Mission for that country. In its expression of support for the Governing Council of Iraq, the resolution hastens the day when the people of Iraq will be in full command of their own affairs -- a condition that they have not known for some three decades.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">When the Governing Council representatives came to speak before the Security Council on 22 July, they took an important step in the process of reaching out to the international community to communicate their dreams and aspirations for the Iraqi people and, equally important, their plans to achieve those aspirations. Through the resolution that we have just adopted, the Security Council has made clear that we heard the Governing Council's message and that we will work with it as a broadly representative partner -- a partner with which the United Nations and the international community can engage so as to support it in its endeavours to build a better Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">The resolution helps pave the way towards the peace, stability and democracy that the long-afflicted Iraqi people so richly deserve. It also sends a clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation under way in Iraq that they are out of step with world opinion. In this resolution we endorse again the vital role that the United Nations is playing in Iraq. The Secretary-General recommended the creation of a United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq to better enable the United Nations to fulfil its responsibility under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a>; we fully support the Secretary-General's request.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">The text just adopted as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1500(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1500 (2003)</a> reflects the vital role of the United Nations in Iraq and creates the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). It also rightfully welcomes the establishment of the Governing Council of Iraq. We are all agreed that the goal is to create, as soon as possible, an internationally representative Government exercising the sovereignty of Iraq. That must be worked up with and by the Iraqi people. We want to make progress rapidly, but of course it will take some time to create the rights and opportunities which have so long been denied to the Iraqi population.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The United Kingdom is working with the coalition partners for an Iraq which can assume its rightful place in the international community and where the instruments of the international community can operate normally. That will entail a growing role for the United Nations and its agencies, and UNAMI will be an important catalyst for this.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Lastly, the United Kingdom welcomes the support given to this resolution, reflecting the Security Council coming together and its members increasingly converging to work for the shared objective of a stable, united and free Iraq.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Pakistan voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1500(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1500 (2003)</a>, on Iraq. It contains two important elements: first, acknowledgement of the Governing Council of Iraq and, secondly, the establishment of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">At every stage of the Council's deliberations on Iraq with regard to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1472(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1472 (2003)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1476(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1476 (2003)</a> and especially <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1483 (2003)</a>, Pakistan's position was guided by the interests of the Iraqi people. The resolution just adopted upholds the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. Pakistan, of course, would also wish to see the reaffirmation of other principles, such as: the right of the Iraqi people to choose their own political destiny and form of government and to exercise their right of self-determination; non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of Iraq; permanent sovereignty and control over the natural resources of Iraq; respect for the religious and cultural traditions of the people of Iraq and for the sanctity of holy places; and, finally, the right of the Iraqi nation to economic and social reconstruction. Those principles, indeed, are the framework within which the Security Council must take all decisions and actions relating to Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Pakistan has also advocated a central role for the United Nations in the restoration of peace and security in Iraq, the provision of humanitarian relief, Iraq's reconstruction and the restoration of its sovereignty and independence. The resolution affirms the vital role of the United Nations. Importantly, in paragraph 2, it decides to establish UNAMI to help the Secretary-General to fulfil his mandate, as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a> and as envisaged in paragraph 98 of the report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 24 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a> (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-715.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/715</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">We welcome the creation of UNAMI. Pakistan has no doubt that the tasks facing UNAMI will be challenging; it should receive the resources necessary for the purpose. We also have no doubt that the role of UNAMI will continue to grow and to become more important as the Iraqi people move towards recovering their full sovereignty and creating a fully representative Government.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The Secretary-General, in his report pursuant to paragraph 24 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a>, stated that the Governing Council "will provide a broadly representative Iraqi partner with whom the United Nations and the international community at large can engage" (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2003-715.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/715</a>, para. 107</i>). The Government of Pakistan has also termed the establishment of the Governing Council as a welcome first step in the direction of returning governance and restoring sovereignty to the people of Iraq as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">On 22 July, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, said that the Governing Council was "broadly representative of the various constituencies existing in Iraq" (<i><a href="../html/S-PV-4791.html">S/PV.4791</a>, p. 8</i>) and that it would need the full support of the international community. He also stressed the need to prepare a clear timetable for the earliest possible restoration of Iraqi sovereignty. We are glad that the views of my Government on the Governing Council and the concept of an evolution towards a fully representative Government, as reflected in paragraph 1, have been approved.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">At this stage, I should like to make one comment of a general nature. Everyone recognizes the value of consultations and consensus among the five permanent members of the Security Council. However, we believe that it is among the entire Council membership that the Council's decisions should be finally discussed and approved. We hope that, in future, we -- as a non-permanent member -- will have more time to consider draft resolutions, especially on issues as important as Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">We believe that the people of Iraq face monumental challenges in the economic, social and political fields. We hope that the adoption of this resolution will enable the international community to accelerate Iraq's progress towards full normalization of conditions in the country. We look forward to the day when that great nation -- which shares strong bonds of history, faith and culture with the people of Pakistan -- will recover its former glory in the international community and emerge as a leading nation in the Islamic world.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">Spain welcomes the adoption of this resolution, which we joined in sponsoring. Its text reflects the spirit of the Spanish draft presidential statement that my delegation was eager to approve in the final days of our presidency but that agenda-related reasons basically prevented.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The resolution is necessary, realistic and relevant. It secures the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and reaffirms the Organization's vital role in Iraq's reconstruction. Moreover, it hails the existence of the Governing Council as a first step towards what we all wish for: a sovereign, stable and democratic Iraq -- ultimately, an Iraq that controls its own future in peace and prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Finally, I should like to indicate that I agree with the comments made by the representative of Pakistan concerning the desirability of extending Council discussions to all members as a general rule.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Trautwein</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Germany voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1500(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1500 (2003)</a>. We believe that this decision by the Council today marks an important step. Germany has always advocated a vital role for the United Nations in Iraq, and we welcomed the recent suggestions of the Secretary-General in that regard as being of the utmost importance for the necessary implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The decision of the Council to establish the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), with the responsibilities set out in the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-715.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/715</a>), definitely reaffirms that indispensable, vital role and is therefore a significant step in the right direction. Moreover, that decision creates a direct responsibility of UNAMI to the Council and allows the Secretary-General to furnish the United Nations efforts with the necessary financial means.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">We also agree with the Secretary-General that the establishment of the Governing Council has to be welcomed as an important first step in the development towards an internationally recognized representative government in order to create momentum in the political process.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1500(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1500 (2003)</a> deserves merit for having implemented those requests of the Secretary-General as such without unnecessarily politicizing the matter. In that respect, the adoption of this resolution will contribute to finding a common way forward which will lead to the full sovereignty of Iraq. Irrespective of the fact that the resolution is certainly not the one about which the media has speculated in the last few days -- a revision of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a> -- it marks, from our point of view, the beginning of a process that should lead to a more even balance of responsibilities among the United Nations, the international community and the Coalition Provisional Authority in the common effort to rebuild Iraq economically and with respect for democratic values and the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Without in any way diminishing the substance of this important resolution, I would like to conclude by saying that we would have appreciated, if not expected, a more transparent and comprehensive consultation process among all members of the Council, with a view, inter alia, to giving more members of the Council an opportunity to consider sponsorship.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aguilar Zinser</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Mexico voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1500(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1500 (2003)</a>, convinced of the fundamental and decisive role that the United Nations should play in the process of rebuilding Iraq and in the efforts of Iraqis to recover full sovereignty.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">My country considers this resolution to be a necessary technical step to enable the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to carry out fully the tasks entrusted to them by the Security Council through the provisions of the relevant Council resolutions, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a>, which clearly states that it is the responsibility of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to coordinate the post-conflict activities of the United Nations, to coordinate among United Nations and international agencies engaged in humanitarian assistance and reconstruction activities and to assist the people of Iraq. The resolution further stipulates that those activities must be carried out in full and absolute independence.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">In that context, the Secretary-General, in the report (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-715.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/715</a>) on the activities of his Special Representative for Iraq, which he submitted in fulfilment of his mandate, gave a detailed account of the tasks that he considers the United Nations should carry out in order to make a positive contribution to Iraq's recovery of its sovereignty and to the reconstruction of the country, including the establishment of a critical road map and concrete timetable for establishing a fully representative government that can exercise the sovereignty of the Iraqi people.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">In that context, the creation of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, which is provided for in the resolution that the Council has just adopted, is a vital step towards fulfilling those tasks. That Mission enables the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to have an effective presence in Iraq so that their tasks can be carried out independently, forcefully and capably.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">We voted in favour of this resolution because it is our concern that there should be a United Nations presence in Iraq. It is our concern that the United Nations should play a decisive role in that country's development. It is our concern that the United Nations should support the Iraqi people by establishing an independent and sovereign government. It is our concern that the United Nations should fulfil its humanitarian duties, employing its capacities in that area. It is our concern that the United Nations should have the institutional capacity to provide for, defend and promote human rights and to create a space for the participation of international humanitarian agencies in carrying out those objectives. Finally, it is our concern that, as indicated by the Secretary-General, the United Nations should actively participate in Iraq's full recovery of its sovereignty, and in the termination of the military occupation. In that context, we associate ourselves with the Security Council consensus on welcoming the establishment of the provisional Governing Council as a first logical step towards establishing a genuinely representative government that exercises the sovereignty of the Iraqi people. That welcome does not constitute legal recognition. Nor should it be interpreted as endorsement. It is not, because the Governing Council is still under the authority of the occupying Powers.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">Lastly, the independence of the United Nations in Iraq means that the international community has entrusted it with tasks that are distinct from the obligations of the occupying Powers established as an Authority. The Authority formed by the occupying Powers bears the responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of the population in the occupied territory. That obligation stems from the Fourth Geneva Convention and is in no way affected by the present resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Like other members of the Council, my country has already conveyed to the sponsors of this resolution our view that it should be through the search for consensus among the 15 members, through the broad discussion of all initiatives, that we can arrive at broader and more consolidated agreement in the decisions of the Security Council. That is why we hope that procedures will be respected in future initiatives, so that all members of the Council will participate in all stages of discussion and adoption of a resolution.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">The Russian Federation has consistently advocated that the United Nations should play an enhanced role in the political settlement of the situation in Iraq. We are convinced that the resolution of the complex problems facing that country can be achieved only through the consistent efforts of the entire international community, with the United Nations and the Security Council playing a decisive role.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">It is necessary to fully restore the sovereignty of Iraq as soon as possible and give to the Iraqi people the right to independently manage the resources of their country. Conditions should be created to ensure that the Iraqi people are able to choose a legitimate and internationally recognized Government that can help resolve the crisis in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">From the outset, Russia has supported a Council decision on establishing the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. The resolution adopted today, with our active participation, fully reflects Russia's position supporting the Secretary-General's recommendations to deploy a full-fledged United Nations mission to play an important role in resolving the crisis and rebuilding Iraq. The resolution is in keeping with Russia's approach to the creation of the temporary Governing Council in Iraq, which is an important first step towards establishing an internationally recognized Government and restoring State sovereignty.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">We hope that this Council decision, in addition to its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a>, will give added impetus to increasing the real participation of the United Nations in the Iraqi post-war process, leading to the solid settlement of the Iraqi problem in keeping with international law.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">As the representative of China was the last speaker on the list, I will make a statement in my capacity as representative of the Syrian Arab Republic, which is an explanation of Syria's position on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1500(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1500 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">The Syrian Arab Republic abstained in the vote on the resolution just adopted by the Council. We did so to reflect the Arab position endorsed by the Foreign Ministers of Arab States members of the Arab follow-up committee that met in Cairo on 5 August 2003 on the question of fraternal Iraq, and in keeping with Syria's responsibility as the Arab representative on the Security Council. Syria and all Arab States support the need to end the occupation of Iraq and to form a legitimate national Iraqi Government, as soon as possible and within a clear and specific time frame, based on equal rights and justice for all Iraqi citizens and free of ethnic, gender or religious discrimination, so that the world will be able to deal with a legitimate Iraqi Government.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">Today Syria reiterates to the Council its support for the position adopted by the Foreign Ministers of Arab States members of the follow-up committee, who stressed that the formation of the interim Governing Council of Iraq is a beginning that will gain credibility from the fact that it is paving the way for the formation of a national Government that represents the full spectrum of Iraqi society and is capable of fulfilling the aspirations of the Iraqi people. Hence, only the Iraqi people can lend legitimacy to the Governing Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Syria reaffirms its commitment to support the central role of the United Nations in Iraq, be it terms of the political process or reconstruction. We also support the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">We regret that the sponsors of the draft resolution did not take into account a number of important recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his report in <a href="../pdf/S-2003-715.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2003/715</a>, of 17 July 2003, which were widely supported by members of the Council. We deeply regret that the consultation exercise, which was conducted outside of Security Council Chamber in a format that lacked transparency, did not include the input of rotating members of the Council, including Syria, in the substantive part of the draft resolution. That resulted in the sponsors maintaining the text and not accepting proposals for logical amendments, which narrowed the options available to us and made the text available to us on a "take it or leave it basis".</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">Syria hopes that in future discussions and resolutions pertaining to Iraq, the Security Council will comprehensively address all aspects constituting the genuine concerns of the brotherly people of Iraq. We also hope that the Council will work to bring about a resolution of all such concerns in order to ensure the end of occupation and to enable the people of Iraq to restore national sovereignty over their territory and, as soon as possible, to establish an elected national Government that enjoys the support of the Iraqi people and is recognized by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
