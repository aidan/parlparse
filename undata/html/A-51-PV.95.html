	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa07">In connection with draft resolution I, on personnel matters in general, I wish to draw the attention of the General Assembly to paragraph 26 of section III (B), the second part of which should read as follows:</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk16-pa01">I wish to address the issue of the scale of assessments and the draft resolution (A/C.5/51/L.56) before us, which was adopted last Thursday night by the Fifth Committee. It was not possible for my delegation to receive instructions on this matter at the final hour, and we therefore could not make our views known. I refer in particular to paragraph 1 (a) of the draft resolution, which calls for the inclusion of a proposal based on the methodology used for the scale of assessments for the period 1995-1997.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk16-pa02">In the view of my delegation, this is an unacceptable inclusion. It means in practice that we leave open the possibility that all the hard work of the Fifth Committee could come to nothing in the fall of this year. It means that the fragile consensus that had been reached on a number of the issues discussed is effectively being ignored. In our view, those delegations that may have insisted on this inclusion are causing delegations such as mine a great deal of difficulty, which could have serious consequences for our work and cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk16-pa03">My delegation is very unhappy about this state of affairs. Our preference has always been to move our work forward in this field, not backwards, and we would have liked to see this particular paragraph deleted. If this is not possible, we would like to have these brief comments put on record: that we do not accept the possibility of returning to the status quo of the current scale. We will resist such an outcome when the matter comes up again during the fifty-second session of the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa01">The complicated formula that was used so that consensus could be reached on the resolution we have just adopted was the high price that the Member States decided to pay for consensus at this stage of the negotiations to establish the scale of assessments for the next triennium. For the first time, the Committee on Contributions was requested to submit various proposals for the scale instead of a single proposal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa02">My delegation would like to state for the record that the practice established in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213.pdf">resolution 41/213</a>, whereby the General Assembly should adopt budgetary decisions with the broadest possible agreement, does not prejudice or preclude the right of Member States, in accordance with the Charter and the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, to submit draft resolutions. Indeed, such drafts help identify areas of possible agreement and move the negotiating process forward.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa03">For this reason, and out of our belief that the present financial situation of the United Nations is not related to the scale of assessments, my delegation submitted draft resolution A/C.5/51/L.21. That draft was an important demonstration of the Mexican delegation's flexibility on the elements to be included in the methodology to be used for the next triennium. In our view, it contains elements enjoying broad agreement among the membership of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa04">The content of that draft was incorporated in the resolution we have just adopted. My delegation trusts that this resolution will enable us to find and agree on a satisfactory solution on this item.</div>
