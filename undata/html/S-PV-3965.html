	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Angola and Portugal, in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1999-27.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/27</a>, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by Brazil, Canada, Gabon, Malaysia, Namibia, Portugal and the Russian Federation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">It is my understanding that the Security Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Burleigh</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The United States will vote in favour of this draft resolution because of our deep concern about the fate of the crews and passengers of the two United Nations aircraft that were recently downed over Angola. We urgently call on the Government of Angola and UNITA to cooperate fully with the search-and-rescue mission and with the investigation of these tragic incidents.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">We do have concerns about two aspects of this draft resolution. We question the appropriateness of the reference to Chapter VII, since the draft resolution does not seek to authorize new international enforcement action. We are concerned that such a reference might be misunderstood as a step in that direction.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Secondly, we doubt the wisdom of considering the imposition of sanctions against communications with UNITA. The past three weeks have demonstrated the crucial importance of being able to communicate quickly with UNITA on search-and-rescue operations and other humanitarian concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">We believe that the only way to resolve this ongoing conflict is through negotiations and not through military action. A negotiated settlement cannot be achieved without the ability to communicate with all parties. In this context, the report requested by this draft resolution must address how such communications can be maintained with all parties.</p>
