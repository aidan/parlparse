	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council congratulates René García Préval on his inauguration as President of Haiti. The Council also congratulates all newly-elected parliamentarians and calls upon them to recognize the importance of the mandate given to them by the Haitian people to work constructively to build a better future for their country. To this end, the Council urges the executive and legislative powers to establish a fruitful and collaborative relationship. The Council stresses that the timely holding of municipal, local and remaining parliamentary elections is fundamental to democratic governance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council underlines that many challenges remain to be tackled, including the need to ensure a secure and stable environment in Haiti, strengthen its democratic institutions, foster national reconciliation, inclusiveness and political dialogue, promote and protect human rights and the rule of law and build governmental capacity, and welcomes Mr. Préval's commitment in this regard. The Council also emphasizes the need to reform and strengthen Haiti's police, judiciary and correctional systems, and, in this regard, looks forward to the results of the discussions between MINUSTAH and the new authorities on how to address these and other security-related issues. Recognizing that development remains essential to Haiti's stability, the Council calls on donors and relevant stakeholders to continue to assess and coordinate assistance priorities, in close cooperation with the new Government, taking into account existing mechanisms such as the Interim Cooperation Framework. The Council reiterates the need for the quick implementation of highly visible and labour-intensive projects that help to create jobs and deliver basic social services. In this regard, the Council looks forward to the upcoming meeting to be held in Brasilia on 23 May.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes CARICOM's intention to reintegrate Haiti fully into the activities of the Community. The Council also expresses its appreciation for the contribution of the Organization of American States to the electoral process. In this regard, the Council supports the commitment of the new Haitian authorities to enhance cooperation with regional partners in order to address issues related to regional stability.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the continued efforts by MINUSTAH and the international community to assist Haiti in its ongoing transition, and requests that MINUSTAH work closely with the new authorities in the implementation of its mandate. The Council looks forward to the report of the Secretary-General requested in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1658(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1658 (2006)</a> on whether to restructure MINUSTAH's mandate and reiterates its willingness to cooperate with the newly-elected authorities to address the long-term challenges facing Haiti. The Council would like also to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts and dedication to the success of the United Nations presence in Haiti."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-22.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/22</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
