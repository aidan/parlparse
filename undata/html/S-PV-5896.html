It welcomes the agreement to ban the use of weapons and violence as a means to settle disputes, irrespective of their nature and under any circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"It calls for the implementation of this agreement in its entirety, in accordance with the Arab League initiative and in conformity with the Taif agreement and all relevant Security Council resolutions and statements of its President on the situation in Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms its strong support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty, unity and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized borders and under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory."</p>
