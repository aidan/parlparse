<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The resolution that we have adopted this evening was flawed, in our view, in that it failed to explicitly condemn the terrorist groups and those who provide them with political cover, support and safe haven in the perpetuation of conflict in the Middle East. Those responsible for killing civilians obstruct the Quartet's efforts and the prospects for Palestinian reform. They are known groups -- Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. The leaders and spokesmen of these groups have openly claimed credit for scores of terrorist bombings and for many deaths and injuries. Their actions are aimed at the peace process, at Israelis and at Palestinians.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">This Council cannot claim to be seriously considering efforts in the Middle East unless it is also willing to recognize the tragic dynamic at play. Each time a glimmer of hope, however dim, appears, a terrorist act rises up to extinguish it. What we had hoped for at this time was for the Council to assume its responsibilities, take a clear stand against the actions of these terrorist groups and call for action against them.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">This resolution starts that process, but it does not go far enough. Nor does it provide the clarity and context we think is required, as set out in the draft text we ourselves tabled on Monday. Our text was more explicit on terrorism, those who perpetuate it, the need to combat it, and on strong support for the Quartet, the political process and continued effort on the ground in the region. Because this resolution does not meet that standard, and because we do not think it as well conceived or worded as it should be, given the importance of the issues it addresses, we have abstained.</p>
