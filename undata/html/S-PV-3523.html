	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in Haiti, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-305.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/305</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1995-306.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/306</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 7 April 1995 from the Permanent Representatives of Argentina, Canada, France, the United States of America, and Venezuela to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the members of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the transfer of responsibilities from the multinational force (MNF) to UNMIH that took place on 31 March 1995 and shares the Secretary-General's view, as stated in his report of 13 April (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-305.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/305</a>), that this transfer was a milestone in the overall efforts of the international community to bring peace and stability to Haiti. The Council commends the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, the MNF Force Commander and the other dedicated personnel of the United Nations and MNF who made the transition possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council notes, however, that much remains to be done to institutionalize democracy in Haiti and reiterates the Secretary-General's call for the people of Haiti and their leaders to help UNMIH help them. While UNMIH's presence will assist the Haitian Government to sustain a secure and stable environment, the existence of a functioning and fair justice system and the early deployment of a permanent and effective police force by the Haitian authorities are central to Haiti's long-term stability. The Council joins the Secretary-General and Friends of Haiti in inviting Member States to make voluntary contributions to support the international police monitoring programme and assist with the creation of an adequate police force.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Government and people of Haiti bear the primary responsibility for Haiti's political, economic and social reconstruction. However, the Security Council notes that the sustained commitment of the international community is indispensable for long-term peace and stability in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council shares the opinion of the Secretary-General that the issue of security is central to the entire United Nations operation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council underlines the crucial importance of free, fair and secure elections for the democratic future of Haiti. The Council stresses the necessity of a secure environment in Haiti, including during the June and July legislative and local election period, and underlines the importance of a functioning police force and an established judicial system. The Council urges the Government of Haiti to take all necessary steps to ensure the success of the elections, and in particular to register as many voters as possible prior to the elections and to assure, in cooperation with the international community, that political campaigning occurs in an environment free from partisan intimidation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council welcomes President Aristide's meetings with leaders of political parties and members of the Provisional Electoral Council and stresses the importance of dialogue with a view to achieving the political consensus needed to enhance the benefits and credibility of the electoral process. The Council also calls on the Government of Haiti to cooperate fully with the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) to ensure that the preparations for elections and the elections themselves can take place in a secure and stable environment. Consistent with the objectives of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 940 (1994)</a>, the Council emphasizes the importance for the Presidential elections to take place on schedule before UNMIH's scheduled withdrawal in February 1996.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"Finally, the Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's decision to coordinate UNMIH's peace-keeping mission with development activities carried out by others, in a manner consistent with UNMIH's mandate, to help the Government of Haiti strengthen its institutions, particularly the judicial system. The Council hopes this coordination will promote closer cooperation of all concerned in Haiti</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">as well as improve the effectiveness of international support for rebuilding Haiti's economy."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-20.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/20</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
