<p>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): I wish
to inform representatives that owing to reasons of <i>force</i>
<i>majeure</i>, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Dominican
Republic will speak today at the end of this afternoon's
meeting, as his country has just been struck by a strong
hurricane that has caused tremendous human and material
losses. The hurricane has also affected other countries of
the region, such as Haiti and possibly even Cuba. The
reason for this schedule change is of a humanitarian nature
and explains the situation as well as the Minister's need to
return to his country as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
I appeal to members for understanding in this respect,
and I trust that we can express our solidarity in this way.
We will also be conveying, through the Minister for
Foreign Affairs of the Dominican Republic, our sympathy
and our wish to cooperate with that country.

Republic of Colombia.

<blockquote>
<b>The President </b><i>(interpretation from Spanish)</i>: On
behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to
welcome to the United Nations the President of the
Republic of Colombia, His Excellency Mr. Andrés
Pastrana Arango, and to invite him to address the

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>President Pastrana Arango </b>(<i>interpretation from</i>
<i>Spanish</i>): Mr. President, as I address the Assembly for the
first time as President of Colombia, I should like to offer
you, on behalf of my Government, our warmest
congratulations on being elected to guide our debates
during this session.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A few weeks ago, the most important democratic
elections in Colombia's recent history took place. Despite
the problems that have besieged our nation in the last few
years, our institutional structure has faced one of the
sternest tests ever and has again shown that it is solid. In
June, more than 12 million people -- one of the highest
electoral turnouts in the history of the Republic --
expressed their free, spontaneous and conscious choice.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Today, Colombia is looking towards new horizons.
We have restored confidence in our country. We have
started the changes which will enable us to face our
internal problems with determination and which will win
us a more positive and dynamic place in the international
community.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Our most urgent task will be to build for peace. That
is the unshakable commitment of my Government and the
</blockquote>
<p>
heartfelt desire of all of the Colombian people. We are
aware that any process designed to root out the causes of
conflict for all time will be highly complex. But all our
efforts will be dedicated to this noble goal, and we will
strive for it tirelessly.
</p>
<p>
It is for this reason that I have personally taken the
lead in building peace. We are working hard on the
preparation of an agenda for this purpose. We are
convinced that representatives of all sectors of society
should play a part, and that at the end of the road we will
find a guiding light that will lead our country again to
peaceful coexistence. Peace in Colombia will also be
founded on a clear strategy for economic development and
a bold policy for social justice. Only in this way will it be
possible to forge a fruitful and lasting peace.
</p>
<p>
As we travel the road to peace the support of the
international community will complement our own efforts.
</p>
<p>
We will advocate respect for fundamental rights and
full application of international humanitarian law among all
those involved in conflict. We will learn from the valuable
experiences of other countries in the solution of internal
conflicts, and we will adopt whatever is applicable and
appropriate to our own situation.
</p>
<p>
Peace in Colombia will demand very substantial
investments in social sectors and infrastructure in the zones
of conflict. For this, we will create a "Peace Fund". A
significant portion of the money required will come from
internal sources. We will also be looking for contributions
from the international community, from which we have
already received expressions of encouragement, solidarity
and interest.
</p>
<p>
All these actions will be part of what we have termed
"diplomacy for peace". It will be diplomacy with social and
economic content. It will be diplomacy expressed in
investment and in the mobilization of human, technical and
financial resources, so that our peace will have a firm and
lasting foundation.
</p>
<p>
The achievement of peace in Colombia will be an
important initial contribution to the liberation of mankind
from one of the twentieth century's greatest evils: the
global problem of illicit drugs. To the extent that we can
find agricultural alternatives for our peasant farmers, with
fair prices for their products at home and abroad, they will
become less dependent on illicit crops. The support of the
international community will be crucial in this. The
eradication of illicit crops will be one of the central
</p>

elements of the peace talks that we intend to undertake
with the groups engaged in armed conflict.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is true that the end of East-West confrontation
brought into being a system of international relations
based on <i>détente </i>and on a decline in the role that military
power had played during the cold war. The spectre of a
nuclear cataclysm seemed to have vanished, and all
humanity embraced new hopes for the future.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It was thought that the end of the cold war would be
the salvation of the many countries and the millions of
people who had been forgotten in the midst of tensions
and feuds between the two superpowers. But now, almost
10 years later, those initial expectations are far from
becoming a reality. Ethnic and religious rivalries, regional
confrontations and grave new threats to peace have
emerged.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I must say most clearly that my Government and the
people of Colombia absolutely reject all kinds and modes
of terrorism, whatever their origin or motive. There can
be no truce with terrorism. All States must fight together
to defeat it. This is surely one of our greatest challenges.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Corruption is buffeting democracy in a growing
number of countries and is becoming a cause of political
and social breakdown. Illicit drugs continue to be one of
the worst scourges of today's society, bringing irreparable
harm to the new generations and, therefore, to the future
of humanity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Human rights are still not properly respected.
Women are still the target of abuse and discrimination.
Children are the victims of disgraceful practices. Fifty
years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, the more vulnerable groups often have no
access to the protection that States are obliged to provide
for them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Unsustainable consumer and production practices
still continue. The planet's natural resources are being
depleted, its biological wealth is being looted, and our
rivers and oceans are being contaminated. Poverty
continues to affect huge segments of society. Economic
growth in some countries and the prosperity of some
levels
of
society
contrast
dramatically
with
the
marginalization suffered by the majority of the world's
population.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This situation is occurring in an international
environment in which the right to development is
</blockquote>
<p>
indissolubly linked to the existence of a favourable
international climate. We are going through the most
serious financial crisis since the end of the cold war, but
there does not yet seem to be sufficient clarity and political
will to face it and overcome it.
</p>
<p>
All Latin America has voiced its concern at the gravity
of the crisis. Its origins are outside our region, in which
countries have made structural reforms to achieve healthy
economies that will enable them to meet the social
expectations of their peoples.
</p>
<p>
We are aware of the risk of a world recession, and we
consider it essential that the more developed countries, the
Group of Seven and the international financial organs adopt
suitable measures to prevent any new collapse. Such a
disaster would irreversibly affect the developing countries
first. The measures should enable the financial markets to
recover their stability and provide a rapid solution to the
current crisis in the world economy that has caused so
much concern.
</p>
<p>
Among the proposals which Colombia made at the San
Francisco Conference and which were included in the
United Nations Charter, there are two I would now like to
mention, because they belong to the common heritage of
our foreign policy: first, compliance in good faith with the
obligations assumed by the Member States of the United
Nations, as an underlying assumption for the validity of its
universal action; and secondly, recognition of the role
played by regional arrangements and agencies in the
maintenance of peace, in international security as an
integrated concept and in the peaceful settlement of disputes
between States.
</p>
<p>
Colombia believes that universalism and regionalism
are
complementary
and
should
support
each
other
harmoniously. Therefore, one of the aims of our diplomacy
is to strengthen the regional agencies within the concept of
universalism. It is thus essential that we join our efforts to
regain the momentum achieved on the occasion of the
fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations, so
that the Organization will be revitalized and ready for the
beginning of a new millennium.
</p>
<p>
The various levels of action required are all based on
the credibility of the multilateralism which the United
Nations embodies and the trust which our peoples have in
it. Some support the approval of certain reforms that the
experience of this period of history and the changes on the
world scene have in themselves made imperative. The
United Nations cannot be expected to possess magic
</p>
<blockquote>
formulas that we ourselves do not have for solving
problems and situations that concern us all, within the
context of the interdependence and internationalization
characteristic of our times. But we certainly need to adapt
them to this moment in history, when we face such wide
horizons and colossal challenges. We need something of
the idealism and pragmatic spirit which could be inspired
by solidarity among the human race.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The reasons for the creation of the United Nations
not only remain intact, but also have rapidly even become
more relevant in the second half of the twentieth century.
The principles which inspired its creation have become so
important that any action taken unilaterally or by a group
of States turns out to be inadequate or limited in effect.
Therefore, it will be useful to identify what we can do to
make the proposed reforms truly worthwhile. One must
seek a genuine consensus for the agenda of priorities for
the new millennium.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Colombia is ready to help reconcile existing
disputes. This is not a question of a simple, formal
agreement or of a quest for utopian reform, but of a
meeting of wills and a methodical and open-minded
consensus regarding proposals which are designed to
bring us closer to an era of greater justice and balance.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We must eliminate the contradiction in which more
responsibilities, actions and programmes are demanded
from the United Nations while at the same time some
States fail to meet their obligations or do not show any
willingness to increase their contribution in proportion to
their capacity. Without doubt, the United Nations must be
properly funded. The adaptation of structures, regulations
and modes of operation means that the Organization must
have the personnel and the funds it needs, through
efficient and exemplary management.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Cooperation for development must receive a massive
injection to save it from decline, and this must be in
accordance with the text and spirit of the Charter and of
countless commitments, within an overall concept that
includes encouragement of respect for human, individual,
social, economic and cultural rights.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
My Government has a policy of encouraging broader
participation by the new actors on the international stage,
such as non-governmental organizations and the private
sector. New sources of funding for certain social,
development and humanitarian programmes should be
sought, which should extend the scope of action of the
</blockquote>
<p>
United Nations and ensure that it continues to steer the
common course of international solidarity.
</p>
<p>
We need multilateralism with social content, in which
the human being is the central priority and in which
development is the guiding principle in decisions. I stand
before you to appeal to all nations to contribute to the
burial of the post-cold-war period, to see it as no more than
an interregnum, and to open the door wide to an era of
creative and more humane multilateralism.
</p>
<p>
The original principles of the Organization are of
course still valid, but we need to make some adjustments.
We need to reconsider certain modes of international action
and heed the voices of the peoples who desire development
and fight for it in the midst of difficulty and conflict. We
need to strengthen communication and dialogue between
North and South and to correct unreasonable imbalances.
</p>
<p>
We believe that the time has come to make an
objective review of the present state of negotiations for the
reform of the Organization, in order to ensure that social
and economic matters are properly related to the legitimate
aspirations
of
developing
nations.
There
must
be
instruments to encourage rapport between the organs
originating from the San Francisco Charter and those
institutions born at Bretton Woods.
</p>
<p>
We know that the responses of individual nations or
groups of States are insufficient. Therefore, there is an even
more urgent need to coordinate global responses through
vigorous multilateralism. There is an obvious dichotomy
between de facto globalization, science and technology,
instantaneous communications and the world market, on the
one hand, and, on the hand, the absence of genuine social
order and human advancement.
</p>
<p>
We must revive an authentic and productive North-
South dialogue, based on a concept of solidarity which is
more substantial than declarations or good intentions and
which is expressed in specific action. It must take account
of the needs of the more vulnerable groups and of those
excluded from progress. It must replace the logic of
confrontation and of the division between poor and rich
countries
with
the
logic
of
cooperation,
shared
responsibility and solidarity inspired by justice as the
golden rule of multilateralism.
</p>
<p>
His Holiness Pope John Paul II summed up this
position perfectly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary
of the United Nations, when, addressing this same
Assembly, he urged us to unite our efforts to build a
</p>
<blockquote>
civilization of love, founded on the universal values of
peace, solidarity, justice and liberty, to overcome the fear
which darkens human existence at the end of the
twentieth century.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We firmly believe that the Charter and all the
institutions of the international system must promote
dynamic cooperation, each enriching the shared universal
heritage with its own particular character.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The United Nations must not be merely a forum for
the sovereign expression of States. It must be the place
for negotiation and synthesis in the political, cultural,
social and economic life of the nations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is reassuring to see that the grand designs that
inspired the Charter remain valid. It is now our task to
maintain them and to interpret the new situations that
arise in the course of history.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We know, for example, that conflicts within States
are conceptually different from the old wars between
States. We have a greater understanding of the link
between peace and development and of the way in which
politics and socioeconomic interests are related. We
believe that it is appropriate to consolidate a minimum
international order and to replace violence and terrorism
with peace and coexistence, which should then thrive
naturally through multilateralism.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Colombia encourages the efforts undertaken in arms
control, with the systematic quest for disarmament as the
ultimate goal, and supports the priority allocation of world
and regional resources to development. We believe that it
is therefore essential to make progress in the control and
gradual elimination of weapons of mass destruction and
to exercise effective control over the illegal arms trade, to
which thousands of men, women and children fall victim
daily throughout the world, and especially in the
developing countries.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We need a realistic and methodical strategy to secure
peace in our time and in the coming century. We need to
promote monitoring mechanisms for treaty compliance,
the negotiated solution of conflicts and the creation of
nuclear-free zones with effective verification systems. In
this respect, the United Nations will need to perfect early-
warning systems to evaluate events so that its actions will
be efficient and genuinely preventive.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I have come here today to reaffirm Colombia's
unbroken tradition as a nation devoted to the great
</blockquote>
<p>
principles that underpin the very existence of the United
Nations. We are prepared to offer, with thoughtful
optimism, our support for the achievement of its purposes
and its reforms. We believe it would be useful to review
and appraise the results of the various summits held in
recent years, so that we may follow up their results and
plans of action. This will serve both as a gauge of their
effectiveness and as the central element of the analysis of
the coordination of the various institutions of the United
Nations system as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Our people rightly demand more effective action and
less empty rhetoric. We cannot betray billions of human
beings who yearn for a world at peace, with democracy and
freedom, and above all just, united and equitable.

Mr.
Jules
Wijdenbosch, and to invite him to address the Assembly.
</p>
<p>
<b>President</b>
<b>Wijdenbosch</b>:
Before
starting
my
statement, I should like to express, on behalf of my
delegation, our sympathy to the victims and their families
in the path of the destructive Hurricane Georges through the
countries of our region, including Caribbean sister nations.
I call upon the United Nations and its humanitarian
agencies to render all possible support to the countries and
the peoples afflicted.
</p>
<blockquote>
Allow me to extend my congratulations to you,
Mr. President, on your election to preside over our
General Assembly at this session. I would also like to
express my appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for
his important contribution during the last session.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In addition, may I also thank the Secretary-General,
Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continuous efforts to transform
our United Nations into a more effective instrument for
promoting peace and enhancing the well-being of the
people of the world as we move into a new millennium.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<i>Mrs. Osode (Liberia), Vice-President, took the</i>
<i>Chair.</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The restructuring of the Security Council with a
view to properly reflecting the present international
economic and political reality and to meeting the new
challenges of the next millennium is of fundamental
importance. My delegation believes that the discussions
should not be limited to the mere expansion of the
Council, but should rather address the improvement of its
effectiveness and its adherence to the principle of our
Charter that all States are equal. We would like to
emphasize that my delegation fully underscores the
position taken by the Non-Aligned Movement, most
recently at its twelfth summit meeting in Durban, South
Africa.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Suriname is pleased with the call by the Secretary-
General for greater cooperation between the United
Nations and regional organizations in preventing conflicts.
In the western hemisphere, it is mainly the Organization
of American States and the Caribbean Community
(CARICOM) which have often demonstrated their
capabilities of overcoming seemingly insurmountable
hurdles by preventing or ending conflicts between and
within member States.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Allow me to raise some matters of equally serious
international concern that require urgent attention. A
disturbing and despicable phenomenon, which we all must
condemn in the strongest terms, is the senseless attacks
on and even killing of international civil servants,
including United Nations field officers. Since these heroic
men and women are contributing to the cause of
humanity, crimes committed against them must be treated
as crimes against humanity and punished accordingly.
Recent terrorist attacks in Africa, Europe and elsewhere
have once more shocked the international community and
have left us in a state of dismay.
</blockquote>
<p>
The Republic of Suriname condemns international
terrorism and welcomes the conclusion of regional
agreements and mutually agreed declarations to combat and
eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
</p>
<p>
My Government deeply deplores the fact that the
process for durable peace and reconciliation in the Middle
East has again been stalled and the current situation
continues the great suffering of the Palestinian people and
uncertainty for the people of Israel. We call upon all sides
to re-establish mutual confidence and call on the
international community to exert every influence on the
parties concerned to save the peace process.
</p>
<p>
It is recognized that the phenomenon of globalization
presents a challenge for the Caribbean region, and requires
fundamental changes in our economies and in the
developmental process of the region, while increasing the
risk of marginalization for all vulnerable economies.
</p>
<p>
In this regard, we share the view that the small
Caribbean States should be granted a reasonable period for
adjustment to the changing international environment, in
order to enable us to improve our competitiveness, and a
non-reciprocal preferential system must be maintained
during that transition period. This will allow for a more
realistic transition, which will eventually facilitate better
adaptation of our economies.
</p>
<p>
More than ever, the interdependence of States has
become clear, now that the negative consequences of
globalization have recently manifested themselves in a
dramatic manner for many of our member States. I
therefore make an urgent appeal to all responsible actors
involved in the world economy, including the international
financial institutions and monetary authorities, to adjust
their relevant policies so as to redress the structural,
financial and economic imbalances and adverse effects that
have risen.
</p>
<p>
We call upon all nuclear-weapon States to accede to
and fully implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty. We are convinced that the new Department for
Disarmament and Arms Regulation will bolster the capacity
of the United Nations to pursue these objectives, bearing in
mind the ruling by the International Court of Justice in July
1996 that the use of, or the threat to use, nuclear weapons
is contrary to international humanitarian law.
</p>
<p>
As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Suriname wishes
</p>
<blockquote>
to reiterate its commitment to these rights. At the same
time, my Government holds the view that it is equally
important not to focus our attention solely on the
fulfilment of civil and political rights; we should also
focus on the fulfilment of the social and economic rights
of our peoples.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is in this respect that Suriname believes that the
implementation of the "Right of Development", in
particular for peoples in the developing world, must be
given equal attention by the international community.
What should be stressed in this context is that human
rights
and
sustainable
human
development
are
interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The promotion
of human rights is, indeed, of particular relevance in a
globalized world, with its potential to marginalize the
weak and small States, particularly those with limited
resources.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Suriname takes part in the General Assembly debate
with a sense of pride, since it has demonstrated to the
world its acceptance of responsibility for the protection of
the environment by preserving one of the most pristine
forests on this globe for conservation purposes. My
country has recently created the Central Suriname Nature
Reserve, comprising 1.6 million hectares and 12 per cent
of the territory of the Republic of Suriname. This nature
reserve, one of the largest nature reserves in South
America and possibly the single most pristine tropical
area on Earth, is our gift to humankind for eternity. I
consider this gift a special contribution to, among other
things, the safeguarding of one of the fundamental human
rights of the world population, namely, the right to life.
We hope that other nations will follow this example and
commit themselves to the protection of the forests of our
world.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The
information
superhighway
facilitates
the
exchange of information and can also contribute to the
development and the promotion of public awareness
worldwide. However, I must also express my sincere
concern about the possible negative consequences of the
misuse of this form of technology, which could have
adverse effects on all strata of our communities, including
our youth. It deserves serious consideration to develop
and implement legislative measures to prevent any form
of misuse of this form of technology, without in any
respect jeopardizing the fundamental right of free
expression.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
As a result of the twentieth special session of the
General Assembly, devoted to the world drug problem,
</blockquote>
<p>
Suriname is now in the final stage of organizing a
subregional conference on the drug problem, the aim of
which is to establish a plan of action in cooperation with
Guyana, Venezuela, Brazil and France, in order to
effectively combat this form of organized crime.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I am pleased to conclude that since our last
Assembly reform of our Organization has been well on its
way, with a renewed emphasis on economic, social and
development activities, and the need to implement its
mission of peace, development and human rights in a more
effective manner.
</p>
<p>
We must continue to revitalize the United Nations,
since it is our universal instrument for concerted action in
the pursuit of our noble aim of the betterment of
humankind. It bears repeating, again and again, that the
majority of the key conflicts in the world, and the threats
to the world community, can only be solved or averted
through the strengthening of our multilateral mechanism.
</p>
<p>
The United Nations must be that mechanism. Our
combined political will should be its new life; a new life
for the challenges of the new millennium.

transformed by the powerful forces of globalization and
liberalization.

All countries are now inextricably linked as

communications.

The tremors triggered by the crises of the South-East
Asian economies and, more recently, the turmoil in the

the dangers of the contagion effect. Even those countries
which are trying to be efficient and competitive face the
possibility of external shocks because of the volatility of
capital markets.
</blockquote>
<p>
I believe that the world community should devise
creative and effective mechanisms to prevent emerging
economies which have put in hard work from losing the
fruits of liberalization.
</p>
<p>
We must not go back to the inward-looking strategies
of the 1960s. We must continue to open our economies, but
with greater caution.
</p>
<p>
This is a great challenge for a large majority of
nations, particularly the least developed ones. We know
only too well that a number of developing countries are
among the most vulnerable and are not yet ready to
integrate into the global economy.
</p>
<p>
When I last addressed this Assembly, I dwelled at
some length on the generally grim situation in Africa,
which remains one of the most intractable challenges to the
world community. It is a continent rich in natural resources
and yet afflicted by widespread poverty.
</p>
<p>
Peace and development in Africa have been, for more
than a decade, the subject of endless debates and
resolutions at the United Nations. But we know that
sustainable development in Africa is conditional upon the
achievement of a strife-free continent. It is sad indeed that
year after year the number of potential flashpoints seems to
grow more numerous. The situation in many regions of
Africa remains a cause for great concern.
</p>
<p>
The peoples of the continent can ill afford the
pointless strife and violence visited upon them at a time
when the priorities should be economic and social
development.
</p>
<p>
We in Africa naturally have to bear the primary
responsibility for assuring lasting peace for our peoples.
This is precisely what the leaders of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) are striving to achieve.
</p>
<p>
In his statement to this Assembly, on Monday,
President Nelson Mandela, current Chairman of SADC,
mentioned the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. This difficult problem figured prominently on
the agenda of the summit which Mauritius hosted a few
days ago, after it was addressed earlier by the Victoria Falls
meeting and the Pretoria special SADC summit.
</p>
<p>
I wish to renew here our appeal to all parties involved
in this conflict to solve their differences peacefully through
political dialogue and diplomacy. In the Indian Ocean
region
to
our
immediate
southwest,
Mauritius
is
</p>
<blockquote>
participating fully in the efforts of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and of the countries of that region
to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis facing the
Comoros on account of separatist activities by a group on
the island of Anjouan. Mauritius fully supports the unity
and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of the
Comoros.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Fortunately, however, all is not gloom when we
survey Africa. We note with satisfaction the continuous
positive economic growth that most sub-Saharan countries
have enjoyed lately.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I had the privilege to participate in a round table
together with the Deputy President of South Africa earlier
this year, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, on the
new competitive Africa. The consensus was that Africa
stands at the threshold of a new era -- an era of
opportunity and dynamism. We are at the dawn of an
African renaissance.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Governments in Africa are becoming increasingly
democratic and responsive, putting more emphasis on
economic development, greater openness, market-oriented
policies and greater economic reform.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Regional cooperation is another positive feature of
the new Africa, working through groupings such as
SADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) and the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) to facilitate cross-border
trade leading to the ultimate establishment of an African
Economic Community.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But for Africa to realize its full potential, several
serious constraints will have to be overcome.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The international economic environment should be
made less hostile to Africa. Africa's shares of world trade
and foreign direct investment still remain at a paltry level.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The debt burden has become in itself a crippling
factor and needs urgently to be alleviated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We
also
cannot
sufficiently
emphasize
the
importance of official development assistance in this
regard. We therefore deeply deplore the decline in the
levels of official development assistance among the major
donor countries. Today, they stand at a historical low. We
are now, more than ever, far off the target of 0.7 per cent
of gross national product recommended by this Assembly.
This trend must be reversed.
</blockquote>
<p>
Mauritius took the initiative recently of highlighting
the specificities of small island economies in the context of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the negotiations
of a successor agreement to the Lomé IV Convention. As
a result, recent ministerial declarations adopted by both the
WTO and the OAU now contain explicit references to small
economies and their high vulnerability. This reality is now
gaining recognition within the Bretton Woods institution.
</p>
<p>
For the reasons I have just mentioned, small
economies require time and space to adjust to the new
world trade order. We therefore reiterate the need for the
maintenance of non-reciprocal trade regimes until such a
time as we are adequately prepared.
</p>
<p>
The Lomé Convention is a model of North-South
cooperation. The proposed United States African Growth
and Opportunity Act could become another. Together with
the other members of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA), we would like to reaffirm
our total support for its passage.
</p>
<p>
Mauritius has always accorded the highest priority to
regionalization to break out of its insularity and enlarge its
economic base. Mauritius was a major player in launching,
15 years ago, the Indian Ocean Commission and, more
recently, the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional
Cooperation.
</p>
<p>
The Assembly will appreciate that an island State like
Mauritius would be interested in the protection of the
marine environment. We recommend for the particular
attention of the General Assembly the report of the
Independent World Commission on the Oceans, according
to which the very survival of the human race over the long
term is jeopardized by the abuses to which the world's
oceans are subjected.
</p>
<p>
We have to address as a matter of priority the three
most immediate dangers identified by the Commission: the
overexploitation of marine biological resources, the
dumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of global
warming. While much has been achieved since the Rio
Earth Summit, we deplore the fact that the initial
momentum and urgency appear to have been lost in sterile
and fractious debate. I urge that we address these questions,
on which our very survival depends, with renewed
earnestness and a greater sense of shared responsibility.

We also reaffirm our profound belief in the equality
of all rights -- social, economic and cultural, as well as
civil and political. Today, Governments can no longer
flout the rights of their citizens without being subjected to
the censure of the international community. Yet millions
of inhabitants of many parts of the world remain deprived
of their fundamental rights by oppressors and tyrants who
govern by force. We have observed with horror the
atrocious crimes against the dignity and worth of the
human being committed during recent conflicts. My
Government therefore welcomes the recent adoption in
Rome of the Statute of the International Criminal Court.

ingredients
for
successful
development.
Considering the complex sociocultural and ethnic mix of
our population, we have taken great care to ensure that all
our citizens, regardless of their origins or gender, have
equal access to education, adequate health care, proper
housing and employment opportunities. We will soon

<p>
equality and the empowerment of women. We in Mauritius
are taking legislative measures to translate our commitment
into practical reality.
</p>
<p>
We have now become even more aware of the need to
seek global solutions to our common problems. Climate
change, illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism are problems
which require a coordinated international approach. No
nation can live under a dome, with its climate isolated from
the rest of the world. No country can on its own fight
international drug traffickers or terrorism. We therefore
condemn unequivocally all forms of terrorism and call for
enhanced international cooperation to combat and prevent
its occurrence.
</p>
<p>
While social, economic and trade matters are
increasingly -- and with good reason -- occupying centre
stage in international forums, crucial problems of security
and disarmament continue to retain their capacity to derail
our efforts for development.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year we were reminded of the dangers for
humanity of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the
attendant risks of a new arms race. No country can feel
genuinely secure as long as the threat of nuclear weapons
exists from any quarter. In this respect, we welcome the
stand taken by both India and Pakistan in exercising self-
restraint. We reiterate our position that any international
instrument for the elimination of nuclear arsenals should be
non-discriminatory in nature. Security for all will be
achieved only when that threat is completely eliminated.
Global nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of all
weapons of mass destruction must remain our ultimate goal.
</p>
<p>
Finally, as on past occasions, we would like to bring
up once more before this Assembly our lasting claim on the
sovereignty of two territories which were taken from our
patrimony: the island of Tromelin and the Chagos
archipelago. We reiterate our call to the former colonial
Powers to enter into constructive bilateral dialogue with my
Government for the early restoration of those territories to
the sovereignty of Mauritius.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the Chagos archipelago, this Assembly
should also be reminded that some 1,500 inhabitants -- the
so-called "Illois" -- were coerced to leave their homeland
to clear the way for a military base. Most of the families,
who had lived for generations on these islands, were moved
to the main island of Mauritius, victims of the then
prevailing cold war. Today, after more than 30 years, they
still experience tremendous difficulties adapting to their
present conditions. Many yearn to be resettled on these
</p>
<blockquote>
islands. As we are about to commemorate the fiftieth
anniversary of this century's seminal document on human
rights, we consider that we owe it to these Illois to fully
re-establish their rights, including the right of return.

<blockquote>
Bilateral partnerships, mainly characterized by non-

third countries, have been established one after another.
Various regional and intercontinental organizations of
cooperation have become more active than ever before.
Such endeavours to seek the establishment of stable,
pragmatic and balanced international relations contribute
to peace and development as well as to the establishment
of a fair and equitable new international political and
economic order.
</blockquote>
<p>
However, we cannot lose sight of the many
uncertainties still existing in the world.
</p>
<p>
The nuclear arms race is a product of the cold war. In
the post-cold-war period of today, the people of all
countries call fervently for the prevention of nuclear
proliferation and endeavours for nuclear disarmament.
</p>
<p>
It is to be regretted that last May India conducted
nuclear tests, going against the tide of the times, thus
adversely affecting peace and stability in South Asia.
</p>
<p>
Soon afterwards, Pakistan, too, conducted nuclear
tests. Their nuclear tests not only led to an escalation of the
tension between the two countries, but also dealt a heavy
blow to international nuclear disarmament and the
mechanism for the prevention of nuclear proliferation. This
has aroused the great concern of the international
community. We hope that India and Pakistan will fully
implement the Joint Communiqué of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, as well as the provisions
of Security Council resolution 1172 (1998), give up their
plans to develop nuclear weapons and immediately and
unconditionally accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We appeal to India and
Pakistan to resolve the dispute over the issue of Kashmir
through peaceful means.
</p>
<p>
In our view, following the nuclear tests in South Asia,
the international community faces the pressing task of
consolidating and strengthening the international non-
proliferation mechanism to prevent further proliferation of
nuclear weapons and enhance the universality and authority
of the NPT.
</p>
<p>
China has all along stood for the complete prohibition
and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Back in 1994,
the Chinese Government proposed to the General Assembly
that a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons
should be concluded through negotiations. Furthermore, the
Chinese Government has on many occasions called on all
the other nuclear States to undertake not to use or threaten
to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States and
nuclear-free zones, has proposed the conclusion of a
convention on no first use of nuclear weapons through
negotiations and has called for the early negotiation of a
fissile material cut-off treaty. China was active in the
negotiations on the CTBT and was among the first to sign
the Treaty. Today, I would like to reiterate on behalf of the
Chinese Government that China will abide by the
provisions of the Treaty and has no intention of resuming
</p>
<blockquote>
nuclear testing. China will continue to pursue the policies
of unconditional no first use of nuclear weapons and
unconditional no use or threat of use of nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear States and nuclear-free zones and will
continue to support the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva to negotiate and conclude a non-discriminatory
and verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty on the basis
of the agreed mandate. China urges the countries with the
largest nuclear arsenals to accelerate their nuclear
disarmament process. As to the question of the ultimate
complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear
weapons, China, as a nuclear State, will never shirk its
responsibility.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The East Asian financial crisis that broke out in July
1997 has caused a sharp decline in the economies of
many countries of the region. Its negative impact is still
spreading. The drastic devaluation of the Japanese yen
since last June has added to the difficulty of economic
recovery in the region.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The crisis occurred in the overall context of
economic globalization, and its impact is being felt across
the world. Stepping up international cooperation and
putting an early end to this crisis is not only in the
immediate interests of the East Asian countries, but also
in the interests of the international community as a whole,
and especially of the developed countries. We hope that
those developed countries with important influence on the
region's economy will shoulder their responsibilities and
take active, resolute and effective measures to make their
due contributions to safeguarding the stability of the
financial
order
and
promoting
the
recovery
and
development of the region's economy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Following the eruption of the East Asian financial
crisis, the Chinese Government has taken a highly
responsible attitude. China has rendered assistance to the
countries concerned within the framework arranged by
International Monetary Fund and, at the same time,
through bilateral channels. Proceeding from the overall
interests of maintaining the stability and development of
the region, China has made the decision not to devalue
the yuan renminbi, for which we have endured great
pressure and paid a heavy price. Now, despite the
growing pressure and risk facing us, our decision to
maintain the stability of the yuan renminbi will remain
unchanged.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Fighting with one heart and one mind, we won the
battle against the disastrous floods. We have taken a
series of measures to deepen our reform and expand
</blockquote>
<p>
domestic demand so as to ensure the sustained growth of
our economy and achieve the objective of an 8 per cent rise
in this year's gross domestic product. We firmly believe
that with the common efforts of the countries in the region
and of the rest of the international community, the East
Asian economy will be able to gradually get out of its
predicament and return to the road of sound development.
</p>
<p>
The Middle East peace process has been in a stalemate
for some time, which has aroused widespread concern in
the international community. We are of the view that the
Arab nations and Israel should hold earnest and pragmatic
negotiations so as to achieve a comprehensive, just and
lasting peace, which will be not only in the fundamental
interests of the Arab and Israeli peoples, but also conducive
to world peace and stability. We hope that all the parties
concerned in the Arab-Israeli disputes will take a flexible
and pragmatic position to promote steady progress in the
peace negotiations under the principle of land for peace and
on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and
the agreements already reached. The Chinese Government
will, as always, support the Middle East peace process and
the efforts made by the United Nations and the relevant
parties to this end.
</p>
<p>
We are following the developments in the Kosovo
region of Yugoslavia with concern. It is our hope that the
parties involved will solve the problem through political
dialogue. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia should be respected. Peace and stability in the
Balkans have been hard won and should be cherished all
the more by the relevant parties and by the international
community.
</p>
<p>
The border conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea and
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are
another source of concern for us. It is hoped that they will
be appropriately resolved by the parties involved through
peaceful means.
</p>
<p>
The twenty-first century is greeting us. On the
threshold of the new century, the United Nations bears
heavy responsibilities with regard to maintaining world
peace, promoting human progress and establishing a just
and rational new international political and economic order.
It has an irreplaceable role to play. Above all, after the end
of the cold war, the United Nations, with fewer constraints
and more vitality, is confronted with unprecedented
opportunities. In this context, the United Nations should and
can use its own advantages to play a unique and
constructive role in building a peaceful, secure and stable
world, in establishing a new type of international
</p>
<blockquote>
relationship based on friendship and cooperation and in
taking up the common challenges facing mankind.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
China has consistently held that it is necessary to
carry out appropriate reform in the United Nations so that
the Organization can better keep abreast of the changing
situation and serve its numerous Member States. We have
taken note of the initial progress of United Nations reform
in a number of fields promoted by all Member States.
Some reform measures and recommendations proposed by
the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, have been
approved by the General Assembly and are now being put
into practice. Intense discussions on reform of the
Security Council are also in orderly progress. At present,
there are still differences among Member States on quite
a few issues involved in the reform of the Security
Council. We hope that all parties will adopt a constructive
approach and play an active part in the relevant
consultations with a view to reaching a proper settlement
of relevant issues.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Here, I wish to reiterate the basic position of the
Chinese Government on these issues. First, the reform of
the Security Council bears on the interests of all countries
and so requires a democratic style of work and extensive
and full consultations. All Member States should have an
equal right to speak on the question of the reform, and
their reasonable proposals should be fully reflected.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Secondly, the Security Council is not a club of rich
countries. The purpose of its reform is not just to meet
the concerns of a few big countries. Rather, more
attention should be given to the interests and aspirations
of
the
vast
number
of
developing
countries.
Representation should be balanced between the developed
and the developing countries.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Thirdly,
the
reform
measures
are
of
major
significance, as they bear on enhancing the role of the
Security Council in maintaining international peace and
security. They should be worked out on the basis of the
realities and in the light of history. It is a matter of course
that the objective of the reform of the Security Council is
to solve problems rather than to create new sources of
discord. In order to ensure that the reformed Security
Council gains extensive support from Member States, it
is essential to adhere to the principle of consensus.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In the past 50 years, the Declaration has vigorously
promoted the advancement and development of the cause
</blockquote>
<p>
of human rights in the world. Vast numbers of people in
Asia, Africa and Latin America freed themselves from
colonial rule. The South African people rooted out the dark
system of apartheid, won basic political rights and became
an equal member of the international community. The
United Nations, for its part, adopted a series of international
instruments on human rights such as the Declaration on the
Right to Development, further enriching the content of
human rights. The right to development has been
universally recognized in the international community as an
inseparable part of basic human rights.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, earth-shaking changes have taken
place in China. Especially in the past two decades, since the
introduction of reform and opening up, China has witnessed
an ever-improved practice of democracy, an ever-improved
legal system and ever-enhanced legal protection of the
rights of its people. It is perfectly obvious that the Chinese
people now enjoy a higher degree of freedom and equality
than ever before and a much fuller and more settled life
than in the past. The Chinese Government will continue to
make unremitting efforts to advance democracy and to
strengthen the legal system, while developing the economy
so as to better ensure that its people enjoy human rights to
the full.
</p>
<p>
The Chinese Government is active in supporting and
participating in the activities of the United Nations in the
field of human rights. China has all along stood for
international cooperation in the field of human rights on the
basis of equality and mutual respect, so as to enhance
understanding, narrow differences, expand common ground
and strengthen cooperation through dialogue. The Chinese
Government is ready to engage in dialogue, exchanges and
cooperation, on the basis of equality and mutual respect,
with human rights organizations at the national and
international levels.
</p>
<p>
Last October, the Chinese Government signed the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights. As to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, I earnestly declare here that the Chinese
Government has decided to sign it early next month. This
once again testifies to the resolve of the Chinese
Government with respect to promoting and protecting
human rights. China is ready to continue to work with other
countries to maintain and increase the current positive
momentum of dialogue and cooperation so as to promote
the furtherance of the world cause of human rights.
</p>
<p>
This year is the twentieth anniversary of the
introduction of the policy of reform and opening up in
</p>
<blockquote>
China.
In
these
two
decades,
China
has
scored
tremendous achievements in its reform, opening up and
modernization drive. Particularly in recent years, our
national economy has gained a favourable momentum of
high growth and low inflation, thanks to deepened
reforms and strengthened macroeconomic regulation. Last
September, the Communist Party of China, at its fifteenth
National Congress, formulated a blueprint for China's
cross-century
development
based
on
the
new
developments both on the domestic and international
scene. In March this year, our new State institutions and
new Government were formed through elections at the
first session of the ninth National People's Congress of
China. We will build energetically on our political and
economic restructuring and carry forward the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the
twenty-first century in a comprehensive way.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
China's modernization drive requires a stable
international environment of peace. China will continue to
pursue its independent foreign policy of peace. This
policy is sustained by three pillars: to persist in
independence and maintain the initiative, to safeguard
world peace, and to seek common development.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
To persist in independence and maintain the
initiative, we always put our State sovereignty and
national security first and never develop relations with
other countries at the expense of our own sovereignty.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's sacred
territory. The successful return of Hong Kong and the
upcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly provide
useful inspiration and create favourable conditions for the
settlement of the Taiwan question. We will, as always,
adhere to the basic policy of peaceful reunification and
one country/two systems; adhere to President Jiang
Zemin's eight-point proposal on developing cross-Strait
relations
and
promoting
the
process
of
peaceful
reunification of the motherland; expand cross-Strait
exchanges and cooperation in various fields; and
resolutely oppose the creation of the "independence of
Taiwan", "two Chinas" and "one China/one, Taiwan" and
Taiwan's attempt to re-enter the United Nations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We respect the sovereignty of other countries and
vigorously support the efforts of all countries in the
world, and of developing countries in particular, to defend
their State sovereignty, while firmly safeguarding our
own. In handling international relations, we adhere to
non-alignment, non-confrontation and the non-targeting of
Third States. We do not go in for military blocs and the
</blockquote>
<p>
arms race, nor do we engage in military expansion. China's
development will not pose a threat to any other country.
The so-called "China threat" is entirely unfounded and
fabricated with ulterior motives.
</p>
<p>
To safeguard world peace, China is a staunch force for
the maintenance of world peace and regional stability. It is
our consistent view that State-to-State relations should be
handled in a spirit of mutual respect and peaceful
coexistence, transcending differences in social systems and
ideologies. Countries should safeguard their own interests
and, at the same time, respect those of others and
continuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation by
seeking the convergent points of common interests. With
regard to existing differences and disputes, it is necessary
to persist in dialogue, not engage in confrontation, and
strive to settle them by peaceful means rather than by
resorting to force or the threat of force.
</p>
<p>
It is essential to completely reject the mentality of the
cold war, advocate a new security concept and resolve
international and regional security issues through consensus
and participation on an equal footing. We in China stand
for the equality of all countries, big or small, and for
accelerated democratization of international relations. World
affairs should be handled through consultation by all
countries, and no country should impose its own will on
others.
</p>
<p>
To
seek
common
development,
peace
is
the
prerequisite of development and development is the basis of
peace. In today's world, where the economy is increasingly
globalized, countries must pursue an open policy in order
to achieve economic growth. Opening up to the outside
world is China's long-standing basic State policy. As a
huge emerging market, China will strive to keep abreast of
the trend of economic globalization and be even more
active in opening up to the world. It is ready to develop
trade and expand scientific and technological exchanges
with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit and in the interest of common progress. It attaches
importance to and actively participates in the activities of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)
and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and sets store by the
establishment and development of friendly exchanges and
cooperation with other global and intercontinental or
regional organizations for economic cooperation.
</p>
<p>
China continues to take a positive attitude towards
joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Thanks to
unremitting efforts over a decade, China is already qualified
for entry. Regrettably, however, the relevant negotiations
</p>
<blockquote>
have dragged on and on with no decision having been
made. China is a developing country, and we can
negotiate China's entry into the WTO only on this basis,
in accordance with the principle of balancing rights and
obligations. It is our hope that the countries concerned
will take a practical, fair and flexible attitude, give up
excessive demands and work for an early conclusion of
the relevant negotiations. China's joining the WTO will
benefit all its members and make the multilateral trade
mechanism complete and more balanced.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Before I conclude my speech, please allow me to
use the forum of the United Nations to brief you on
China's flood-fighting and disaster-relief efforts. Owing
to such factors as abnormal climate changes this year,
catastrophic floods swept along the Yangtze, Nenjiang,
Songhua and other rivers of China. The sheer size of the
submerged regions, the duration of the floods and the
seriousness of the disaster they caused were something
rarely seen before. Giving top priority to the protection of
people's lives and their safety, the Chinese Government
mobilized forces from all sectors across the country and
organized millions of soldiers and civilians for an all-out
battle against the floods and for disaster relief. Thus, the
assaults of flood crests were repelled again and again; the
safety of the main dykes, the main transport arteries and
major cities along the rivers was ensured; and the loss of
life and property was kept to a minimum.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
At present, the Chinese Government is sparing no
effort to resettle the people affected by the flood and has
started reconstruction projects in the disaster areas. We
are taking every measure possible, with full confidence,
to ensure that there will be no famine and no widespread
epidemic diseases in the wake of the natural disaster and
that none of the pupils or students in the flood-hit areas
will drop out from school or be deprived of education. In
the course of reconstruction, we will carry forward the
great flood-fighting spirit in an all-round endeavour to
push forward our reform and opening up and the socialist
modernization drive.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Since China was hit by the disastrous floods, a
number of countries and international organizations and
communities have sent messages to express sympathy and
solicitude, and rendered support and assistance to China.
I wish to take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the
Chinese Government and people, our most sincere
gratitude to them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The world of today is a world of interdependence.
The promotion of peace, cooperation and development has

<p>
become the main trend of the times. Let us join hands and
work together to bring into the twenty-first century a world
of peace, security and stability in the interest of
development.
</p>
<p>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): The next
speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, His
Excellency Mr. Hubert Védrine, to whom I give the floor.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mr. Védrine </b>(France) (<i>interpretation from French</i>):
Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Mr. President,
on your election, which attests to the high regard in which
the international community holds you and your country,
and which France, as an old and true friend of Uruguay,
welcomes. We hope that the work of the fifty-third session
of the General Assembly will, under your presidency, lead
to the strengthening of the Organization.
</p>
<p>
It was 53 years ago in San Francisco that we, "the
peoples of the United Nations", decided to join our efforts
</p>
<blockquote>
"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of
war...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in
the dignity and worth of the human person...to
establish conditions under which justice...can be
maintained, and to promote social progress".
</blockquote>
<p>
That immense ambition was justified by the recent
horrors, which at all costs were to be prevented from
happening again -- a necessary utopia, perhaps, or a
superhuman task. But as the great French writer Albert
Camus put it:
</p>
<blockquote>
"Superhuman tasks are the ones man takes a long time
to accomplish, that's all."
</blockquote>
<p>
A long time has elapsed, and we are still working on
that, still toiling. We have no reason to be ashamed of what
we have done as the United Nations throughout these 53
years, of what the Security Council and successive General
Assemblies have done, as well as seven Secretaries-
General -- in particular the current one over the last two
years, whose work has been so outstanding.
</p>
<p>
Over the decades, the Security Council, except when
paralysed by abuse of the veto, has almost always managed
to shoulder its primary responsibility for international
security. When it failed to do so, no other institution was
able to in its stead. Since its first peacekeeping operation 50
years ago, the Security Council has launched 49 operations
of this kind.
</p>
<blockquote>
The institutional framework established by the
Charter has, in the most varied situations, ranging from
cold war confrontation to the cooperation of recent years,
proved its irreplaceable usefulness. This again was borne
out in the spring of this year during the Iraqi crisis, when
the Secretary-General was deservedly commended; in
Africa, during the creation of the United Nations Mission
in the Central African Republic, which was the first
entirely new peacekeeping operation in four years; and
even in the Balkans, where the difficult mission entrusted
to the United Nations in Eastern Slavonia achieved its
objective.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And
yet,
as
the
Secretary-General
himself
emphasized recently,
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Unpredictability and surprise have become almost
commonplace" <i>(A/53/1, para. 1)</i>,
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
and the illusions of the end of the cold war have not
stood the test of reality. Our world, let us acknowledge
this fact, is not moving towards greater harmony.
Sometimes our interventions are not appropriate; some
States take advantage of circumstances and deliberately
carry out archaic policies of force that contravene the
principles of the Charter. On other occasions, the
abdication or implosion of States has released among
various groups ancestral forms of hatred that are still very
much alive, thus facilitating organized crime. All these
are destabilizing factors which, while very different, all
help to disorganize and imperil international relations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Several major crises have proved this recently. The
Asian financial crisis reminded us that strong growth,
when badly regulated, is vulnerable in a globalized world
that is all too often dependent on the ultra-sensitive
reactions of the trading floors and the increasingly rapid
spread of contagious effects. Each day $1,600 billion is
exchanged on the financial markets -- huge sums of
money that are greater than the means of intervention of
all the financial institutions of the world. In 1970 those
amounts were equal to the world's gross national product.
Today, they are 15 times greater.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The nuclear tests in South Asia were a dramatic
reminder that a very serious regional territorial dispute
combined with a feeling, justified or not, of insecurity
could open the way to nuclear and ballistic proliferation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In East Africa, a typical armed conflict was born of
a border dispute. In the Great Lakes region, six or seven
States are in the grip of regional conflict on the territory
</blockquote>
<p>
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Destabilization
is threatening Central Asia, starting with Afghanistan. I
cannot list them all, but currently more than 30 conflicts,
civil wars or State break-ups are under way that involve
more than 40 countries in their aftermath of suffering.
Twenty-two million civilians -- displaced persons and
returnees -- have been affected by these conflicts and
require assistance from the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, which is currently active
in 118 countries. Nor can I fail to mention child soldiers;
slavery, which still goes on in a scarcely veiled form;
disappeared persons; and so many other tragedies.
</p>
<p>
But I do not wish my statement to be a long litany of
woe that is only too familiar to the United Nations, which
is the first to learn of these situations. Is it not at this very
moment trying to maintain peace on four continents with
approximately 15,000 personnel engaged in about 17
operations? To cite just one example, no fewer than 20
agencies are trying to rebuild Bosnia.
</p>
<p>
Nor do I intend to neglect the progress achieved in
1998, which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement.
I wish simply to explain that the United Nations and the
multilateral system do not today have the necessary means
to meet all these challenges. But we cannot and must not
give up. How can we restore the necessary vigour to our
action?
</p>
<p>
Allow me to make some suggestions in this area. First,
we can preserve the powers that the Charter has given our
institutions. The first priority is to reserve for the Security
Council a monopoly on legitimate enforcement action in the
case of "threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and
acts of aggression".
</p>
<p>
Nothing can justify the use of force by a State, a
group of States or an organization, however powerful, if
prior authorization was not received from the Security
Council -- except in cases of self-defence.
</p>
<p>
My country shares the impatience of those who
deplore the fact that it should take so long to find a solution
to various cruel conflicts -- for example, in Kosovo, where
the humanitarian situation is so critical. Since November
1997 France has warned of the risks of explosion; it has put
forward many proposals in liaison with Germany and its
other partners in the Contact Group to prepare the ground
for a realistic political solution. It has just begun action for
the return of refugees. It has never ruled out the possible
use of force. On this latter point, I hear voices urging us to
forgo the authorization of the Security Council. But after
</p>
<blockquote>
this case there would be another exception, and then
another. Little by little, any country would declare itself
entitled to intervene wherever its interests, security or
ambitions so required, and we would have to begin all
over again. We must remain firm on this principle.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Second, we must make sure that the authority of the
Security Council is respected and its resolutions are
complied with. This goes for all its resolutions. But today
the question arises particularly in connection with Iraq.
The lifting of the oil embargo has, by the Council's
resolutions,
been
made
subject
to
the
controlled
dismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must
therefore meet these conditions -- completely meet them,
but only them. Once that objective is achieved, our aim
must be to reintegrate Iraq into the international
community, starting with the region.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The only way to achieve that end is by Iraq's
complete compliance with the relevant resolutions -- all
the resolutions, nothing but the resolutions -- which
means Iraq's unreserved cooperation with the United
Nations and the bodies empowered to monitor Iraq's
disarmament.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The third need is to increase the representativeness
of the Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy.
This is why my country has come out in favour of
enlarging the Security Council, with, on the one hand,
new permanent members -- two seats for the North, to
which Germany and Japan have every claim, and three
for the South; on the other hand, there should be new
non-permanent members for the North and South. This
enlargement must at the same time preserve the Council's
effectiveness and not prevent it from carrying out its
responsibilities under the Charter. I hope this fifty-third
session of the Assembly will see progress on this reform.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Fourth, we must increase the capacity of our
Organization to prevent or settle regional crises. There is
much to be done. Now that the international community
has just commemorated on a melancholy note the fifth
anniversary of the Oslo accords, what remains of the
peace process in the Middle East and the hopes born in
Madrid? There is no longer a light shining in the night,
and the fires of hatred are gaining ground. France
continues to support the persevering efforts of the United
States Secretary of State, but we do not wish to be left
without any prospects at all should those efforts
unfortunately not succeed. That is why President Chirac
and President Mubarak have proposed in that event
convening a conference of countries resolved to save the
</blockquote>
<p>
peace. This concern for the future has been very well
received. In liaison with Mr. Amre Moussa, we are working
to further our proposal. We must not abandon the goal of
meeting the aspirations of the peoples of this region for a
just and lasting peace which respects the resolutions and
agreements that have been reached.
</p>
<p>
Another region in crisis calls for our attention. As I
mentioned earlier on the territory of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo six or seven African States of the
Great Lakes region are engaged in confrontation in a tangle
of problems involving border issues, guerrilla activities,
ethnic strife, refugees, the quest for arable land and so
forth. It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in each
of these States. A regional crisis such as this calls for a
regional solution. That is why my country has raised again
the idea of a conference for peace in the Great Lakes
region, which we suggested as early as 1995. The
conference would be placed under the aegis of the United
Nations or the Organization of African Unity, with the
active participation of the States of the region. Several
African diplomatic initiatives have the same goal. We
support those efforts.
</p>
<p>
Africa is currently the theatre of other crises. Let us
pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General's
representatives. Here I salute in particular the memory of
Maître Blondin Beye, who died while on a peace mission.
</p>
<p>
Fifth, there is a need to reinforce the multilateral
disarmament and non-proliferation system. Following the
nuclear tests in South Asia, whose risks everyone
recognizes, we must strengthen the anti-proliferation regime
and pursue the disarmament process in all areas -- nuclear,
conventional, chemical and biological.
</p>
<p>
Our primary objective here should be the entry into
force as speedily as possible of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. France, together with the United
Kingdom, was the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify the
Treaty and is the only one to have completed the
dismantlement of its testing centre. I call on all States that
have not yet done so to accede to this Treaty -- including
India and Pakistan, which have announced their intention
not to carry out any more nuclear tests.
</p>
<p>
Another objective here would be a treaty banning the
production of fissile material for military purposes. I
proposed at the meeting of the five permanent members of
the Security Council held in Geneva on 4 June last that we
should launch such a negotiation. A universal, non-
</p>
<blockquote>
discriminatory and verifiable cut-off treaty would give
new impetus to disarmament.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We should also pursue relentlessly the prohibition of
chemical and biological weapons. Let us see to it that the
Convention banning chemical weapons becomes universal
and that the Convention banning biological weapons is
made truly effective through a verification mechanism.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Combating the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction also means preventing the spread of vehicles
capable of delivering such weapons, while preserving
useful civilian applications.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In
order
to
make
progress
in
conventional
disarmament, let us ensure that the Ottawa Convention
providing for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnel
mines comes into force as soon as possible.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Sixth,
we
should
continue
to
combat
underdevelopment, whose link with crises needs no
further demonstration. France remains heavily committed;
it is the second largest provider of official development
assistance. In order to modernize its aid and make it more
effective, France has decided to reform its cooperation
arrangements and increase coordination with other donors
-- in the first place with the European Union. More than
60 per cent of aid to Africa comes from the European
Union. Europe is also the largest source of aid to Latin
America and the second largest to Asia.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
France would like development resources to be more
predictable. The Secretary-General has made proposals
that we welcome in a constructive spirit, in particular the
idea of a development account. We encourage the United
Nations to continue its discussions in this area.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Seventh,
we
need
to
work
with
the
non-
governmental organizations. They are capable of sounding
the alarm, making proposals and cooperating in very
practical terms to help build States governed by the rule
of law. Parallel to these actions, we expect much from the
activities
of
Mrs. Robinson,
United
Nations
High
Commissioner for Human Rights, both in the Commission
on Human Rights and in the various United Nations
agencies, which must also -- all of them -- integrate the
human rights dimension into their activities.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
After more than 10 years of negotiations, 1998 will
see the adoption of the declaration on the defenders of
human rights. This is a crucial text because these are the
rights that dictatorships try to stifle and threaten.
</blockquote>
<p>
However, even if we reinforce the Security Council,
strengthen the hand of the Secretary-General and better
handle future crises and other aspects of existing ones, this
will still not be enough. We must regain the initiative, and
for that we must extend our efforts to bring worldwide
regulation to other fields. This brings me to my final points.
</p>
<p>
The eighth requirement is to extend the rule of law in
all its aspects. The Statute of a permanent International
Criminal Court was adopted in Rome after intensive
negotiations. It is a major step forward in the fight against
the impunity of the foremost criminals. France was one of
the first to sign it. The Statute achieves an essential
synthesis of the various legal traditions in the world and
strikes a balance between the Court's competences and the
powers of the Security Council that is in keeping with the
spirit and calling of the United Nations. We hope that those
countries that still have reservations will be able to join us.
</p>
<p>
In another field of law, the International Labour
Organization has taken a historic step towards universal
compliance with basic labour standards through the
declaration adopted at its eighty-sixth conference, which is
a commitment on the part of the 174 member States of the
Organization.
</p>
<p>
On
11
November
1997
the
United
Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization adopted
the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and
Human Rights. This is the first normative framework to
guide the international community in an area of scientific
research where advances are already shaking our traditional
concepts of life and social organization. France is
submitting a draft resolution calling on the General
Assembly to endorse this Universal Declaration.
</p>
<p>
Ninth, we must contain and reduce the scourge of
organized crime, beginning with drugs. The volume of
illegal drug trafficking now approaches $500 billion -- 8
per cent to 10 per cent of world trade. According to the
International Monetary Fund, money-laundering operations
represent from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global gross
domestic product.
</p>
<p>
At the special session in New York in June we
decided to put more emphasis on reducing the demand for
drugs, in addition to what we have done about supply. Let
us do so.
</p>
<p>
Tenth, we must combat terrorism in all its forms,
whoever the perpetrators and whatever their motivation.
</p>
<blockquote>
The
recent
International
Convention
for
the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings is an important step
forward, but that is not enough. We must also acquire the
means to hunt down those who finance and instigate these
attacks. France is proposing the negotiation of a universal
convention against the financing of terrorism.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We need to define concrete mechanisms for legal
measures and mutual judicial assistance against those who
finance terrorism. Effective sanctions, such as the seizure
or the freezing of the assets of organizations or
individuals that have participated in terrorist acts must be
provided for. Innovative measures, such as making it
impossible to invoke banking secrecy in judicial bodies
investigating a terrorist attack, should be introduced. If we
have the will to do this, we can launch this negotiation at
the end of the present session of the General Assembly.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
President Clinton spoke here on Monday of this
common struggle as a shared obligation. This is correct.
In addition, we need to attack the multiple causes that
breed terrorism.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The eleventh point I would like to make concerns
the remedy for not only the current financial crises, but
also the malfunctioning of the international financial
system as such. That is the issue here, as is shown by the
increasing calls for a "new Bretton Woods". Financial
globalization is running wild now. New means urgently
need to be found. It is the responsibility of each State to
make its contribution. We need also to define new rules
adapted to today's financial realities. My country is today
presenting to its European partners some proposals to
counter international financial instability.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) must
naturally remain the pivot here. But the IMF must be
more legitimate and more effective, working on the basis
of clear, realistic, political and strategic guidelines,
cooperating with other competent bodies, organizing
dialogue between industrialized countries and emerging
countries, ensuring the transparency of the financial
system and reflecting the economic, social and political
realities of partner countries -- an IMF that can detect
early warning signs to prevent crises from happening.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Within this transformation, to which the Director-
General of the IMF is making an important contribution,
and also in order better to stabilize the international
economic and monetary situation and to support world
growth, Europe will play an increasingly important role
</blockquote>
<p>
since it is finalizing the introduction of its single currency,
the euro, and we are anticipating the benefits.
</p>
<p>
From this period we are living through, which is so
full of contrasts, consisting of unprecedented progress and
of crises threatening to wipe out our efforts, in particular
those made under the aegis of the United Nations,
additional progress must be forthcoming in building a more
just and more peaceful world, because this is what we all
want.
</p>
<p>
Today's world needs rules. The United Nations must
remain the unifying framework, and the Charter must
remain the reference point. Preserving what has proved its
worth, adapting when necessary, inventing new forms of
regulation -- these are three main areas for our work.
</p>
<p>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): The next
speaker is the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, His
Excellency Mr. Lamberto Dini, to whom I give the floor.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mr. Dini </b>(Italy): I congratulate you, Sir, on your
election as President of the General Assembly, a sure
guarantee of the success of the fifty-third session. At the
same time, I wish to thank your predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy
Udovenko, for his fine job in handling the difficult issues
that arose last year.
</p>
<p>
On the broader issues facing the General Assembly in
the year to come, Italy associates itself with and supports
the statement made on Tuesday by the Foreign Minister of
Austria on behalf of the European Union.
</p>
<p>
Fewer than 10 years have gone by since the euphoric
days that surrounded the fall of the Berlin Wall. As our
decade began, "a new world order" was on everyone's lips.
Many believed that we were at the threshold of a new age
of stability, freedom and prosperity. In the ensuing years,
we have indeed witnessed rapid growth in the world
economy, but we have also seen an outbreak of new forms
of nationalism, ethnic hostilities and acts of aggression.
</p>
<p>
Our peoples have grown apprehensive about the future
as they watch the performance of the stock market, internal
instability in various regions of the world, the failure of
financial institutions, the rise and unpredictability of
terrorism, unchecked waves of immigration, the constant
flow of refugees and the resurgence of misplaced nuclear
ambitions. In some countries, a few short months of crisis
was all it took to wipe out the gains of an entire generation.
</p>
<blockquote>
Such crises shed light on an improper balance
between the power of the market and the power of
institutions. Globalization and liberalization certainly have
great merits. They have forced the national political
classes to set public finances in order and to promote
economic efficiency. But a global market requires some
measure of global government built on the knowledge that
the wealth of single States cannot be separated from the
welfare of the international community, a government
whose strength rests on the democracy of institutions. As
Secretary-General Kofi Annan underlined in his speech,
globalization requires good government.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This is why we urgently need to strengthen
international leadership. The institutions are still not
strong enough to provide such leadership, restore
confidence,
introduce
change,
stabilize
the
global
economy, guarantee growth and protect the most
vulnerable of us in the race towards development.
Technology,
communications
and
the
market
are
progressing at a much faster pace than politics and
institutions, thus creating a widening gap.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In the final years of this century, our challenge is to
strengthen institutions and their capacity to coordinate the
action of Governments. Globalization has impacts on
ideologies and behaviour, societies and institutions. The
opening of markets to competition must be accompanied
by reaffirmed cooperation among the largest possible
number of States. The burden of responsibility falls on
the shoulders of the stronger nations, particularly those of
the G-7. They have a duty to show solidarity,
transforming their privileges into benefits for all
humanity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The system of international institutions has the
United Nations as its paramount and most authoritative
benchmark. The United Nations must be the driving force
behind a review of the network of interdependence. Like
industrialization in its early days, globalization produces
both great progress and dangerous imbalances. Thus, it
requires governance. No one country can govern it,
however great its political, economic and military power.
Our century is drawing to a close with a revitalization of
institutions upon which we can build the three pillars of
stability: prosperity, security and respect for fundamental
freedoms.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The first pillar of stability is governance of the
economy to prevent crises from degenerating into
catastrophes. The time has come to perfect the rules of
conduct that guide the development of the global market.
</blockquote>
<p>
While these rules are imperfect and not always respected,
we must assert the conviction that it is important and
appropriate to observe them. This is the secret of their
success. It is up to the economically stronger countries to
guarantee continuity in the development of the market.
They must be buyers, lenders and the final guarantors if we
are to instil confidence and forestall the threat of a global
recession. The forces that drive the global economy are the
same as those that uphold the fundamental freedoms: the
circulation of information and ideas; open borders and
societies; the rule of law and individual rights. The
challenges facing the economy are the same as those facing
freedom.
</p>
<p>
At times, the markets are driven by a short-term logic
that privileges the earnings of today over the growth of
tomorrow. They conduct constant but instant referendums.
The stock market does not always move at the same pace
as the economy and society. Relentless technological
progress can lead to the exclusion of many from the world
of employment. Recent major economic and financial crises
show that the market does not always grow when the State
shrinks. Rather than enhancing freedom, sometimes it only
increases the power of the strongest. It is a dangerous
illusion to think the economic sphere can be unhinged from
the political system, the social context and the history of
nations. There can be no healthy economy without a strong
State, without the rule of law, without social cohesiveness
and protections -- in other words, without respect for
peoples or awareness of their history.
</p>
<p>
The market's supporters should not turn into the
standard
bearers
for
a
new
fundamentalism.
The
international financial institutions must know how to couple
theory and practice, how to avoid strategies that damage
society and destabilize the political system for the sake of
defending the market. They must initiate policies and
reforms that minimize moral hazards in their rescue
operations. They must look at society as a whole and not
just at its financial dimensions. Otherwise, some will rebel
against or flee the market.
</p>
<p>
The United Nations and the international community
can rely on the new cohesiveness of the European Union.
The
European
currency,
the
Euro,
demands
new
responsibilities at the international level as a repository of
value and as an investment and reserve currency. It will
allow the Union to project abroad standards that it would
not otherwise be able to preserve, such as stability,
competition and social solidarity. The European Union has
no intention of hiding behind the shield of its currency. It
</p>
<blockquote>
has no illusions of being an oasis of prosperity sheltered
from the tempests of the world.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The politicians of Europe are the first to have
rethought the limits of national sovereignty. Today, the
European Union, in the wake of the single currency, is
about to become a political subject, and to participate as
such in world leadership, to correct the fragility of the
complex systems that govern the world. It is not enough
to have strong national powers. For the European Union,
too, the time has come to be a "leading nation". The time
has come to further enhance the rules that have allowed
us to unite the continent, banishing war within our
borders.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
To the South, Europe is facing massive waves of
immigration. Europe is well aware of the needs that drive
to its shores so many people trying to escape from
suffocating demographic trends. Europe knows that the
only solution is an ambitious policy of solidarity and
development. Otherwise, like King Canute, it would be
trying to hold back the sea with a wave of its hand.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Our cooperation policies must be revitalized to help
close the gap between North and South. The Economic
and Social Council, whose presidency will be assumed by
Italy at the start of the coming year, can be instrumental
in eradicating poverty and harmonizing the differences
between and the needs of the two hemispheres.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Renewed institutions will also have to manage the
second pillar of stability: security. Here, too, the United
Nations must play a central role. I refer not only to its
traditional role of direct involvement in peacekeeping
operations. Italy, I would underline, continues to provide
a strong logistic base, as well as men and resources, for
such missions and has long proposed ways to make these
operations more efficient and effective.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I refer also to the novelty of the future: growing
relations with other institutions, including the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to which the
transatlantic community entrusts its defence. The Atlantic
Alliance is redefining its strategies, missions and
membership, but it is also rethinking its relations with the
United Nations in a new spirit. It is looking to the United
Nations for additional legitimacy to broaden the scope of
its mission. This is another crucial aspect of the system of
institutions that can guarantee peace and stability and on
which we must build our future.
</blockquote>
<p>
Peace is also jeopardized by resurgent temptations to
brandish nuclear weapons in an effort to restore regional
balances, enhance national prestige and consolidate national
unity. While such goals can be in themselves legitimate,
they become totally illusory if entrusted to the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction, instruments that threaten
the very right to life. In the framework of institutional
strengthening, we must, as a matter of priority, root out
senseless ambitions that rely on lethal weapons. We must
aim instead to complete the non-proliferation regime and
make it more effective and more universal.
</p>
<p>
Security is jeopardized by a breed of terrorism that has
become more and more irrational, threatening fragile peace
processes, privatizing terror and directing its hatred mostly,
but not exclusively, against the Western world and the
values it represents. We must therefore redouble our
common efforts to fight this scourge.
</p>
<p>
Individual
rights
are
the
third
component
of
institutional strengthening, along with prosperity and
security. The market and fundamental freedoms, as we
increasingly discover, are two sides of the same coin. But
human rights are likely to remain abstract or illusory if the
United Nations cannot enforce them to the benefit of all
individuals
and,
if
necessary,
also
against
their
Governments.
</p>
<p>
The
international
community,
and
all
of
us
individually, must deepen our commitment to safeguard
these rights. The measure of our civilization is the
protection we afford to the weakest and most vulnerable
social groups. I am thinking first of children who are
victims of atrocities whose true dimensions the media is
only now beginning to expose.
</p>
<p>
The Rome Statute to establish the International
Criminal Court represents what is probably the greatest
institutional advancement since the San Francisco Charter.
In this field, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration
of Human Rights, it confers certainty and universality on
the Charter's system of values. But here, too, we must
complete our journey. Therefore, I urge those countries that
have not yet done so -- and they are the majority -- to
sign the Statute and to start to move towards prompt
ratification.
</p>
<p>
The core of every reform touches on the Security
Council. It is not enough to strengthen institutions: we must
make them more democratic and representative. And it is
on the concepts of democracy and representation that the
debate over the future of the Security Council pivots.
</p>
<blockquote>
Significant progress has been made in recent months
in
identifying
measures
aimed
at
improving
the
transparency and the working methods of the Security
Council: greater openness of informal consultations; more
involvement of countries that contribute troops to
peacekeeping operations and multilateral forces; more
prompt and detailed briefings on the Council's activities
by the President-in-office; and ready availability of texts
and documents being examined by the Council.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But the stalemate continues on the issue of enlarging
the Council. The Italian Government will be willing to
support any reasonable formula, provided that it does not
prejudice the eventual establishment of a common
European seat on the Council, distance Italy from the
other principal industrial countries or increase the number
of
countries
that
are
"more
equal"
than
others,
transforming the majority of Member States from
protagonists into mere spectators.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The essential problem is one of principles and
criteria. Italy has made and will continue to make an
active contribution to this question that is of fundamental
importance to international peace and stability. It will
continue to fight for a more democratic, efficient and
geographically representative Security Council. No one
should feel excluded. Every country, no matter how large
or small, has a contribution to make, an experience to
share.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Given the current stalemate over increasing the
number of permanent members, we wonder whether it
would not make more sense to concentrate for the time
being only on an increase in non-permanent seats. The
solution of increasing the number of elective seats for
every regional group would make it easier for all Member
States to have access to the Security Council. After all,
this is the same solution that was adopted in 1963, when
the only previous enlargement of the Council took place.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
As to the method we should follow to get there, we
believe that on a matter of such crucial importance it is
essential that any decision with Charter amendment
implications should be adopted by a majority of two
thirds of all Member States, as prescribed by Article 108
of the Charter.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These are some of our suggestions for the "quiet
revolution" of the United Nations, to which Secretary-
General Kofi Annan has dedicated such passion. We are
grateful to him for his efforts.
</blockquote>
<p>
The century that is about to end has taught that there
are no definitive and total solutions. Although the
institutions are imperfect, they are flexible instruments. It
is our high duty to improve them so that they can become
the visible hand of stability, together with the invisible hand
of the market. Institutions are the only truly indispensable
power.
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Mr. Ba-Jammal (Yemen), Vice-President, took the</i>

<p>
<b>The Acting President </b>(<i>interpretation from Arabic</i>): I
now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United
Arab Emirates, His Excellency The Honourable Rashid
Abdullah Al-Noaimi.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mr. Al-Noaimi </b>(United Arab Emirates): I have the
honour to extend to the President the congratulations of the
delegation of the United Arab Emirates on his election to
the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-third
session. We are confident that his wise leadership and vast
diplomatic experience in international affairs will contribute
to strengthening the role of the Organization in the world
today.
</p>
<p>
I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor,
Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Ukraine, for the distinguished manner in which he directed
the work of the previous session. We also wish to express
our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi
Annan, for his endeavours to maintain peace, security and
stability in the world.
</p>
<p>
As we stand at the threshold of a new millennium, the
international community is witnessing radical changes in
international relations, the implications of which are
reflected in the lives of peoples. The various aspects of
openness and globalization embodied in some of those
changes have not been comprehensive in their positive
aspects, but have resulted in widely divergent levels of
economic and social development among States and have
promoted the emergence of new patterns of problems that
require radical joint international solutions to contain and
deal with them.
</p>
<p>
There is now an increased awareness in the world of
the inevitability of renewing and developing the United
Nations as the essential international tool for dealing with
current world problems and achieving balance, transparency
and justice in international relations.
</p>
<blockquote>
Consequently, we support the positions of the Non-
Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 regarding these
vital issues, particularly the questions within the purview
of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social
Council, and the reform of the Security Council and
enlargement of its membership. We also call for
strengthening coordination, cooperation and dialogue
between the United Nations and regional organizations in
order to mobilize and complement joint international
efforts to deal with many issues on the agenda.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The world has seen positive efforts in the area of
international law, the most important of which were
reflected in the conclusion of a number of international
conventions. The latest of these efforts was the
establishment in Rome of an International Criminal Court,
which we regard as an important step that will contribute
to supporting the principles of human rights worldwide.
We also call for reactivating the role of the International
Court of Justice, which is the essential legal instrument
for settling disputes between States.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Political events in the world, and particularly in the
Arab Gulf region, have proved that radical solutions to
regional disputes can only be achieved through peaceful
means and methods based on the principles of the Charter
of the United Nations and international law. Proceeding
from this belief, and true to those principles, the United
Arab Emirates has adopted a wise policy in its quest for
a peaceful solution to the question of the occupation by
the Islamic Republic of Iran of its three islands --
Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa -- which form
an integral part of our national sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The continued consolidation by Iran of its illegal
occupation of those islands and the imposition of a policy
of <i>fait accompli </i>through numerous military and civilian
measures designed to change their historical, demographic
and legal characteristics are a source of grave tension and
concern in the region. This runs counter to good-
neighbourly
relations,
peaceful
coexistence
and
confidence-building, as well as to the Charters of both the
United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference. Such actions are also incompatible with the
approaches taken by the members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, which call for the settlement of existing disputes
by peaceful means in order to achieve permanent security
and stability in the region and strengthen relations and
common interests between the States members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council and Iran.
</blockquote>
<p>
Accordingly, once again from this rostrum we appeal
to the Government of friendly Iran to demonstrate a serious
political will and accept our genuinely peaceful initiative,
supported by all fraternal and friendly States, either to
engage with us in dialogue and enter into bilateral
negotiations that would address the legal and historical
background of this question, not just its formalities, or
accept resort to the International Court of Justice with a
view to reaching a just and permanent settlement conducive
to terminating the Iranian occupation of our three islands.
Once again we reaffirm that our call for solving this dispute
peacefully emanates from the nature of our historical
relations with Iran and proceeds from our commitment to
the essential principles governing international relations.
This is also in the interest of preserving peace, security and
stability in our region and throughout the world.
</p>
<p>
The United Arab Emirates renews its support for all
peaceful efforts and endeavours by the Secretary-General of
the United Nations towards resumption of the activities of
the Special Commission in Iraq. But we consider it
necessary, in order to avoid any further escalation or
renewed tensions in the region, and in the light of the
importance of preserving the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Iraq and non-interference in its international
affairs, to continue upgrading the food-for-oil programme
and improving its operation in order to meet the
humanitarian needs of the fraternal Iraqi people and to
alleviate its ceaseless suffering. At the same time, we urge
the Iraqi Government to fully implement all the relevant
resolutions of international legitimacy particularly those
relating to the release of the prisoners of war and detainees,
citizens of sisterly Kuwait and other States, and to complete
the restitution of Kuwaiti property so as to ensure the lifting
of the sanctions imposed on Iraq and to enable it to resume
its natural role at the regional and international levels.
</p>
<p>
The Middle East peace process is at a dangerous
stalemate on all its tracks as a result of the adoption by the
Israeli Government of a policy of gradual recanting on all
the obligations and undertakings it has assumed under this
process. The most dangerous aspect of that policy is that
Government's resolve to proceed with implementing its
plans for building more Jewish settlements in the occupied
Palestinian and other Arab territories, particularly in the city
of Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan. It daily perpetrates
atrocious and inhuman crimes against the Palestinian and
other Arab peoples, which constitutes a flagrant violation of
the basic principles on which that process and the Fourth
Geneva Convention of 1949 are based.
</p>
<blockquote>
Aware of the danger inherent in the continuation of
these illegal Israeli acts, we believe there is a need for
effective action by the international community -- in
particular, the co-sponsors of the peace process and the
European Union -- to bring additional pressure to bear on
Israel to force it to comply with its legal obligations and
to demand that it resume the negotiations, without
preconditions, on the different tracks of the peace process,
on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)
and 338 (1973) and the principle of land for peace. We
also express our unceasing support for the Palestinian
people in their quest for self-determination and their
legitimate aspiration to establish their independent State
on their national soil, with Jerusalem as its capital.
Similarly, we support the position of the Government of
Lebanon, demanding that Israel implement fully Security
Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls on Israel to
end unconditionally its military occupation of the south of
Lebanon and its western Bekaa valley without condition.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The establishment of a zone free of all kinds of
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and Arab
Gulf regions is a requirement that complements the peace
process and represents an essential factor in the security
and
stability
of
those
regions.
Accordingly,
the
international
community
should
demand
that
the
Government of Israel accede to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and subject its
nuclear installations to the control and safeguards regime
of the International Atomic Energy Agency. International
measures which so far have been achieved in the area of
world disarmament have not been global in their
coverage, especially since we are witnessing an arms race
and testing of nuclear and other proscribed weapons. Such
developments will not lead to the settlement of existing
disputes between States, but, rather, to an imbalance in
regional security, as is the case between India and
Pakistan and in other regions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We therefore urge both friendly countries to exercise
self-restraint, renounce the use of force and resume
dialogue and negotiations with a view to reducing
tensions and solving their current disputes peacefully in
a manner that will serve the interests of security and
stability in that region. We also call upon the nuclear-
weapon States, and those in possession of such dangerous
weapons, to reconsider their policies, to refrain from
applying double standards and to promote the adoption of
equal measures for confidence-building among States.
Serious steps must be taken by the United Nations to deal
with this shortcoming in a way that contributes to the
creation of a peaceful and stable world free from tension
</blockquote>
<p>
and from the threat or use of such prohibited weapons and
their damaging effects on humanity.
</p>
<p>
While we appreciate the efforts of the United Nations
peacekeeping forces, in cooperation with the regional
organizations, to deal with and contain conflicts and civil
and regional wars in certain parts of the world, we are still
concerned about the failure to contain several crises in
other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, the
Great Lakes region, Angola and other hotbeds of tension.
Recent examples are the situations between Ethiopia and
Eritrea and between Iran and Afghanistan, as well as that
in Kosovo, where the human rights of Muslims are being
flagrantly violated by the Yugoslav Serb forces, whose
actions we strongly condemn as contradicting legally
binding international norms and principles. The United
Nations, and the Security Council in particular, must
assume their responsibilities in putting an end to such
conflicts
and
violations
and
should
promote
the
participation of regional organizations in finding adequate
peaceful solutions to those problems. We also call upon the
parties concerned to cooperate in such efforts by
demonstrating the political will necessary to settle their
disputes by peaceful means.
</p>
<p>
The United Arab Emirates strongly condemns the
terrorist acts that were carried out recently in some African
States, resulting in heavy losses of lives and property. On
the basis of ethical and humanitarian responsibility, the
international community should intensify its efforts to
protect civilians and their rights and to confront the
phenomenon of terrorism, regardless of its origin or form.
However, combating this dangerous phenomenon should not
be
carried
out
on
a
unilateral
basis
or
through
indiscriminate military revenge, which destroys lives and
property, but through joint international action within the
framework of the United Nations in order to ensure the
elimination of all the root causes and manifestations of
terrorism and thereby preserve the security and stability of
societies and the territorial integrity of States.
</p>
<p>
The world economic and financial environment
continues to undergo numerous challenges which have
varying
implications
for
development.
Despite
the
liberalization
of
trade,
the
open
markets
and
the
globalization of the economy that have characterized
international relations, developing countries, representing a
majority of the population of this planet, are still facing a
multitude of problems especially together with the
exacerbation of unemployment, illiteracy and poverty, in
addition to debts and the cost of servicing them, declining
humanitarian and development assistance which have
</p>
<blockquote>
become a heavy burden on many of those States,
particularly the least developed countries. As a result,
their development problems have increased, and that in
turn has led to the creation of a state of instability and
social disintegration.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Recent economic and financial crises in South-East
Asia and other regions not only pose challenges to
sustainable development, but also demonstrate that there
are clear imbalances in the world monetary, economic and
trade systems. Therefore, we call for the development of
global economic and financial strategies to remedy the
real causes of this phenomenon in order to achieve
stability in the world financial, economic and trade
systems. This will also require the reform of international
development and financial institutions to enable them to
adapt to the changing economic situation in the world and
effectively contribute to addressing many of those
problems. That in turn will require the initiation of
comprehensive and objective North-South dialogue, which
should lead to the fulfilment of the goals shared by both
the developing and developed countries.

<blockquote>
In conclusion, I hope that the deliberations of the

<blockquote>
The fifty-third session of the General Assembly is
taking place at a time when my country, the Democratic
</blockquote>
<p>
Republic of the Congo, is the victim of armed aggression
by its neighbours, Rwanda and Uganda, that has been
taking place since 2 August. The seriousness of the actions
of these two invading countries, which are States parties to
the noble ideals of the charters of the United Nations and
of the Organization of African Unity (OUA), obliges me to
dwell at length on this dispute in the hope of helping the
Assembly understand better the drama that is currently
taking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, my
dear homeland.
</p>
<p>
In order to enable the Assembly better to understand
this war and all of its consequences, a brief reminder of the
facts is necessary.
</p>
<p>
On 27 July 1998, the President of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Mzee Laurent-Désiré Kabila, after
consultations with his Rwandan and Ugandan counterparts
took the sovereign decision to terminate Rwanda's military
and technical cooperation and to put an end to the presence
of foreign troops throughout the national territory.
</p>
<p>
When Rwanda's troops left Congolese territory, it was
noticed that certain Tutsis of Rwandan origin, called
Banyamulenge, followed suit.
</p>
<p>
A
week
later,
Congolese
towns
bordering
on
Rwanda -- Goma, Bukavu and Uvira -- were seized by
armed elements that came from that neighbouring country.
</p>
<p>
On 6 August, aircraft started shuttling between Goma
and Kitona, in the west of the country, via Kigali, over a
distance of more than 2000 kilometres. After one of the
civilian pilots was killed for refusing to carry out orders,
these aircraft were diverted from Goma airport to transport
troops and <i>matériel </i>the west, under the direction of Mr.
James Kabarehe, the ex-Chief of Staff of the Congo.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, columns of armoured vehicles and
other military equipment crossed the border from Uganda
under the pretext of defending Ugandan interests in the
Congo.
</p>
<p>
Despite the protests of the Congolese Government,
which demanded their immediate withdrawal, Ugandan
troops surrounded the town of Bunia in the eastern part of
the country on 13 August 1998.
</p>
<p>
On the same day, the Inga hydroelectric dam was
occupied by the Rwandan-Ugandan coalition forces. They
sabotaged the installations in order to deprive the capital,
Kinshasa, of electricity and drinking water.
</p>
<blockquote>
On 23 August 1998, Ugandan troops attacked
Kisangani, in the north-eastern part of the country, and
later occupied it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These facts, and these acts of violence -- confirmed
by independent sources -- provide ample proof of the
aggressive involvement of Kigali and Kampala in the
huge plot to Balkanize the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, all in defiance of international law and the
principle of the inviolability of borders inherited from the
colonial
period,
pursuant
to
the
Charter
of
the
Organization of African Unity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Indeed, one of the two aggressor countries, Uganda,
made no bones about admitting publicly that its troops
occupied certain positions in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
As can be seen, what some media sources wrongly
described as a rebellion from the east was simply a
shameful plot to destabilize my country politically and
economically, and the covetous intentions of Rwanda and
Uganda regarding my country's many natural resources
were barely concealed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is once again
paying a high price for this war imposed on it from the
outside. Among the countless examples are the massacres
of thousands of innocent Congolese, including members
of religious orders, women, children and elderly people in
the east and in the west. These sordid crimes remind us
of the killing of Hutu refugees by elements of the same
Rwandan Patriotic Army. Further examples include the
massive deportations from Kivu towards Rwanda of
people whose fate remains unknown; the summary
executions of prisoners of war; the dismantling, sabotage
and destruction of the industrial, shipping and economic
infrastructure of the country, damage which, to date, has
been estimated at about $3 billion for Matadi alone; the
more than three-week cut in the provision of electric
power and water to the capital, Kinshasa, a city of more
than 6 million people, which was a real humanitarian
tragedy, as is illustrated by the fact that large stocks of
fresh foodstuffs were declared unfit for consumption;
reports of countless deaths in the hospitals because
doctors were unable to work in the conditions required by
their noble profession; and the postponement, <i>sine die</i>, of
the polio vaccination campaign mandated by the World
Health Organization, with untold consequences on the
lives of our children, which gravely compromises the
future of our country.
</blockquote>
<p>
Despite the situation of aggression, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, which is a peace-loving nation that
respects international conventions reaffirms its commitment
to the principles of the Charter and its unshakeable faith in
the promotion of a culture of peace in the Great Lakes
region.
</p>
<p>
The first manifestation of this ideal was demonstrated
by the Government when it appealed to the Security
Council and the Secretary-General to obtain the immediate
and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the reaction of the international
community did not match the gravity of the situation in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Even one of the most
important bodies in the United Nations system -- the
Security Council -- after much procrastination, merely
issued a few ambiguous statements calling for a ceasefire
and the withdrawal of foreign troops without, unfortunately,
specifying them by name. On the other hand, in similar
cases -- in Kosovo, in Bosnia and in Kuwait -- the
Security Council dealt with the situation promptly and
practically to restore peace. Why was there this silence
from the international community, particularly from
Security Council? The Council's policy of double standards
on this issue could set an unfortunate precedent that could
seriously undermine the credibility of the United Nations
and wipe out the reform efforts under way.
</p>
<p>
Given this situation that does no credit to our
community, the Government of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, mindful of its heavy responsibilities to
guarantee the territorial integrity of the country, was
obliged to resort to an armed response to put an end to the
invasion. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo appealed to its allies to
deal with Ugandan-Rwandan aggression.
</p>
<p>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank member
countries of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), in particular, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe,
which responded to our appeal. I would also like to pay
tribute to the valiant Congolese people, who undertook to
defend their homeland when it was under attack. I am also
grateful to Belgium, which had the courage to publicly
condemn a country in the Great Lakes region that was
involved in this act of aggression, and to Ms. Colette
Braeckman, who had the courage to denounce the plot
against my country, as well as Chad, Gabon and many
other African countries that publicly demonstrated their
support and denounced this aggression.
</p>
<blockquote>
The Assembly will agree with me that no honourable
nation can allow its sovereignty and territorial integrity to
be called into question. The Congolese people will never

perverse values such as a cultural genocide, which is so
blithely tolerated by certain States.

The International Criminal Court whose Statute was

The failure of the various appeals for a ceasefire
cannot be blamed on the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. It is rather the result of the obstinacy, bad faith
and cynicism of Rwanda and Uganda during the
negotiations held in Victoria Falls and in Addis Ababa.

<blockquote>
Since the first summit, held at Victoria Falls last
August, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has
indicated that implementation of the ceasefire was
contingent on the immediate, unconditional withdrawal
from our national territory of foreign troops not invited by
the Government of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. I believe that the General Assembly and the
Security Council are obligated properly to implement the
relevant provisions of the Charter, in particular those of
Chapter VII, which envision action by the world
Organization with respect to threats to the peace, breaches
of the peace, and acts of aggression.

<blockquote>
Despite the situation in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, our Government continues to abide by the
timetable leading to the democratization of our political
life. In that connection, I wish to inform the Assembly
that on 22 September 1998 our head of State signed Law
122, relating to the organization and exercise of power in
my country. The new law grants the Constitutional
Commission prerogatives allocated to the Constituent
Assembly, finalizing the draft constitution to be the
subject of a referendum that will be organized early in
1999.

I reassure the international community that my

incitement waged by aggressors wishing to absolve

I cannot conclude without speaking of the rebuilding
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in particular and
of the need for socio-economic development in Africa in
general; the continent continues to face crises of all kinds

Organization of African Unity.

<blockquote>
In the case of my country, the war imposed upon it
by its neighbours has destroyed what remained of its
economic fabric, which had long suffered from the
economic mismanagement of the former dictatorship. That
is why I appeal urgently to the United Nations and more
specifically to the "Friends of the Congo" -- which at the
Brussels conference decided to provide the assistance
needed to rebuild the Democratic Republic of the Congo
-- to contribute to the trust fund established for that
purpose, with a view to helping in the economic recovery
and the rebuilding of my country.

I wish in conclusion to say that my country would
appreciate enormously any action that the United Nations
might consider to prevail upon the Rwandese Republic to
sign the non-aggression pact among the members of the
Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in
Central Africa, and to establish democracy in Rwanda and
Uganda. For all my country's problems are repercussions
of the policy of non-democratization in Rwanda and in
Uganda. The international community would thus be
performing a useful task.
