	Mr. Aho-Glele (Benin)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On behalf of the least developed countries, we have requested the floor in explanation of vote in order to express our surprise, our deep concern and our unanimous disappointment at the request made by one delegation to request a separate vote on operative paragraph 12 of this draft resolution on commodities.</div>
	<div class="p">We would like to emphasize that that provision is but an expression, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of the commitment entered into by the international community, in particular the development partners of the least developed countries, at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Brussels in 2001. Let me recall that commitment:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"We aim at improving preferential market access for [least developed countries] by working towards the objective of duty-free and quota-free market access for all [least developed countries'] products in the markets of developed countries". (<i>A/CONF.191/12, para. 6</i>)</div>
	<div class="p">While we wish to renew our sincere gratitude to all those partners who have and will continue working towards improving preferential access by least developed countries to their markets, we have to point out that the least developed countries, individually or collectively, constitute no threat to the competitiveness of products of those countries due to their structural weakness in responding to market demands. Furthermore, least developed countries hardly begin to develop their productive capacities when they are deemed able to graduate from the group of least developed countries, thus losing the benefits derived from preferential market access.</div>
	<div class="p">In such circumstances, any attempt to call into question a commitment that has been internationally and unanimously undertaken in favour of the least developed countries or to seek unilaterally to suppress it can only fuel and sustain, on the one hand, confusion and inconsistency in such international initiatives, and, on the other hand, vague attempts to subjugate the least developed countries, thus resulting in exploitation of the dire poverty of the most vulnerable segment of the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, improved access for least developed countries to the markets of developed countries is part of a series of specific measures and commitments taken under the Brussels Programme of Action, which has been inadequately implemented since its adoption in 2001 -- a fact that is reflected in the relevant resolutions of the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe that the request for a separate vote on operative paragraph 12 of the draft resolution is an error of judgement. That is why, while there is still time, we wish to make an appeal through you, Mr. President, to the delegation that made that request to withdraw it. If the vote is taken, we wish to ask the international community, in particular the friends of the least developed countries, which continue to work tirelessly to improve the fate of humanity, especially the most vulnerable sectors, to reaffirm their solidarity and commitment to the least developed countries, based on the international community's commitment to combat extreme poverty and human misery.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On this draft resolution, in the Second Committee and today, Canada abstained in the vote on operative paragraph 12. We did not make an explanation of vote in the Second Committee; in retrospect, it would appear that it would have been wise to do so. Since the vote, a number of delegations have approached us to express their concern over our vote, believing that it represented a change of policy on the part of Canada with respect to market access for products originating from least developed countries. Nothing could be further from the truth.</div>
	<div class="p">Canada's market access initiative for least developed countries, which took effect on 1 January 2003, extends duty-free and quota-free access to Canada's imports from least developed countries with the exception of certain over-quota supply-managed agricultural products, a category which is limited to dairy and poultry products and eggs. It is important to note that this initiative is one of the most far-reaching preference schemes for least developed countries of any developed country, partly because of its realistic and liberal rules of origin, which allow for accumulation from all developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p">As a final point, that initiative has had a notable effect on our trade with least developed countries. In 2003, our total imports from least developed countries rose by 77 per cent over their 2002 levels. That includes an increase of 4,307 per cent in imports under the least-developed-countries preferences. That clearly shows the degree to which least developed countries have made use of this Canadian initiative.</div>
	<div class="p">We trust that this explanation of vote has clarified Canada's position on this issue.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Israel is dismayed that the substantive debate in the Second Committee has yet again devolved into a forum for passing unbalanced resolutions motivated by politicized interests which are one-sided, misleading and unproductive. It is especially disappointing this year because it appears that today the Middle East is presented with a window of opportunity.</div>
	<div class="p">It is only through cooperation on the ground that we can make the best use of our region's natural resources for all inhabitants of the Middle East, not through acrimony here at the United Nations or through baseless and unconstructive allegations levelled in our deliberations.</div>
	<div class="p">The connection between this resolution and the issues addressed by the Second Committee is extremely tenuous. The resolution attempts to shift our focus away from our actual priorities. Its adoption only invites further politicization and destruction and is not in line with the spirit of reform and revitalization of the work of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Further, this resolution contributes nothing towards a real peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. It deals with issues specifically reserved for direct bilateral negotiations and in doing so undermines the hopes for such negotiations. It is for those reasons that we voted against this resolution.</div>
