	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1065(1996).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1065 (1996)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-1996-644.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/644</a>, and the report of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia, <a href="../pdf/S-1996-843.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/843</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The Chinese Government has always supported the settlement of differences between the two parties concerned in Georgia through peaceful negotiations. We emphasize that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia must be respected, and we hope that the two sides demonstrate political sincerity and facilitate an early, comprehensive political settlement of the Georgian question through earnest negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">In accordance with the agreement reached by the two parties in Georgia -- and I wish to emphasize -- in accordance with the agreement reached by the two parties in Georgia, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights will set up a human rights office in Abkhazia, Georgia. In order to ensure its efficiency and security, the Secretary-General recommended that the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) provide appropriate support facilities. In this connection, my delegation proposed reasonable solutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The Security Council has entrusted UNOMIG with the primary peacekeeping mandate. We are of the view that peacekeeping operations should have a clear mandate. They should not and cannot be all-inclusive, still less overextended by assuming responsibilities that fall to other agencies. It was on the basis of this principled position and with a constructive attitude that we proposed amendments to the draft resolution before us. Regrettably, however, our amendments were not accepted. We believe that it is beyond the Security Council's competence to authorize the establishment of the aforementioned office, and it is not in accordance with the Agreement between the two parties concerned. Therefore, the Chinese delegation cannot but abstain on the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">We wish to emphasize that, even if this draft resolution is adopted, it should in no way set a precedent for other United Nations peacekeeping operations. The Chinese delegation would like this position to be reflected in the official record.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia, of 10 October 1996 (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-843.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/843</a>). It has also taken note of the letter from the Permanent Representative of Georgia to the President of the Security Council of 8 October 1996 (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-835.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/835</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">"The Security Council notes with deep concern that no significant progress has yet been achieved towards a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict, including on the political status of Abkhazia, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms its full support for an active role of the United Nations, with the assistance of the Russian Federation as facilitator, aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement. In the context of the recent visit to the region of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, the Council requests the Secretary-General to undertake further efforts and make proposals to reinvigorate the stalled peace process. The Security Council stresses that the primary responsibility for achieving such reinvigoration of the peace process rests upon the parties themselves and calls on them, in particular the Abkhaz side, to resume discussions and to reach substantive progress in the negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">"The Security Council is deeply concerned by the deterioration of the situation in the Gali region and its negative impact on the ability of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) to meet its mandated tasks. The Council condemns mine-laying and other threats referred to in the Secretary-General's report against UNOMIG and the collective peacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS peacekeeping force). The Council calls on both parties to take all the necessary steps to prevent all such acts.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">"The Security Council calls on both parties to respect the Moscow Agreement of 14 May 1994 on a Cease-Fire and Separation of Forces (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-583.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/583</a>, annex I) and expresses its concern at the violations referred to in the Secretary-General's report, in particular the serious violations which recently occurred in the restricted weapons zone.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">"The Security Council stresses that the international community's ability to assist depends on the full cooperation of the parties, especially the fulfilment of their obligations regarding the safety and freedom of movement of international personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">"The Security Council is deeply concerned at the announcement made by the Abkhaz side that so-called parliamentary elections would be held on 23 November 1996. The holding of such elections would only be possible after the determination through negotiations of the political status of Abkhazia respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders, within the framework of a comprehensive political settlement, and with the guaranteed possibility of full participation for all refugees and displaced persons. The Council notes that conditions for holding such elections are not met at present. It calls on the Abkhaz side to call off these elections and further calls on both sides to refrain from any action that could heighten tension.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">"The Security Council remains deeply concerned at the continued obstruction of the return of the refugees and displaced persons by the Abkhaz authorities, which is totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">"The Security Council welcomes the good cooperation between UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force and their efforts to promote stabilization of the situation in the zone of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to keep it closely informed of the situation."</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1996-43.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1996/43</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa14">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
