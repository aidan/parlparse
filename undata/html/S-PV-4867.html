	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">The recent attacks in Istanbul have reopened fresh wounds. Once again, in the face of the most cowardly and unspeakable acts of violence, we are confronting the unchanging truth behind the ugly face of terrorism. We see plainly that terrorism is a means of oppression directed at the very existence of human life, civilization and our common values -- values distilled from the moment the human adventure started on Earth. As a nation that had to suffer for more than a decade through one of the most blatant forms of this evil scourge, we called most earnestly for decisive international action and cooperation, long before it struck all around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">Just recently we were more successful in reaching a broader understanding that we should not distinguish between the motivations, forms and so-called causes of terrorism. However, I cannot say that we have been as successful in showing the same sensitivity in not making a distinction between the victims of terrorism. I cannot stress enough that we must all avoid falling into that trap. Just as there are no good terrorists, there are no second-class victims. All terrorists, therefore, deserve to be treated in the same manner; so do the victims of terrorism. A selective approach will prove to be the wrong way to proceed, as terrorism has always turned eventually against the very hands that have fed, abetted or condoned it.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">Finally, as the representative of the host nation, I extend my condolences to my British colleague. I thank those in the Chamber who have expressed their sympathy. An extensive and thorough investigation is under way and has already produced more than circumstantial evidence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this meeting to show solidarity with the aggrieved people of Turkey.</p>
