<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), <a href="../pdf/S-1995-842.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/842</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's report of 4 October 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-842.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/842</a>) on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) pursuant to paragraph 21 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1008(1995).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1008 (1995)</a> of 7 August 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council has noted the positive developments in Angola since the Secretary-General's report of 17 July 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-588.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/588</a>). The Council is encouraged by the meetings in Franceville and Brussels between President Dos Santos and Dr. Savimbi which provided the opportunity to discuss the critical issues and reach agreement on consolidation of the peace process. These meetings, particularly the round table in Brussels, provided important reassurance to the international community. The Council welcomes the continued commitment of both parties to the process of dialogue. The Council commends the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, of the observer States to the Angola peace process, and of States in the region, to help in carrying forward the process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction the progress in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1441.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1441</a>, annex) including the reduction of cease-fire violations, the disengagement of forces, the enhanced cooperation between the parties and UNAVEM III, the signing of the status of forces agreement, the provision of logistic facilities for the mission and the conclusion of the joint declaration on the free circulation of persons and goods. The Council also welcomes the ongoing deployment of UNAVEM III support units and stresses the importance of a timely deployment of the infantry battalions of UNAVEM III. The Council stresses the importance of an independent UNAVEM radio and urges the Government of Angola to provide, without delay, the facilities to allow it to operate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council none the less remains concerned at delays in the peace process, in particular in respect of quartering of UNITA and the Rapid Reaction Police, demining, disarmament, the return of the FAA to barracks and the formation of the new armed forces as well as the repatriation of mercenaries. The Council underscores the peril that may result from further delays. The Council is also deeply concerned at allegations of renewed laying of mines and demands that all parties refrain from such actions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council emphasizes that continuing cooperation between the parties is essential if a sustained cessation of hostilities is to take hold. In this regard, the Council calls on the parties to refrain from troop movements or military activities that might create tension or lead to renewed hostilities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council is concerned about the continuing complaints of human rights violations, and endorses the decision of the Joint Commission to inscribe human rights in the agenda of all its regular sessions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council wishes to emphasize that post-peace-keeping elements can make an important contribution to a viable long-term peace. The Council notes the linkage between political and economic well-being and the need to ensure that displaced people and refugees are able to return to their places of origin. The Council reaffirms the Secretary-General's call for a comprehensive coordinated and integrated effort on the part of all relevant international organizations to help rebuild the Angolan economic infrastructure. The Council requests Member States to continue to support the ongoing humanitarian activities in Angola. It welcomes the commitments made at the Round Table Conference, held in Brussels, in September 1995 and urges those that have made pledges to fulfil their commitments as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council will continue to monitor closely the situation in Angola and looks forward to future reports of the Secretary-General."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-51.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/51</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
