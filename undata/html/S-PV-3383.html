	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them a note by the Secretary-General, transmitting a letter dated 27 May 1994 from the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) addressed to the Secretary-General, <a href="../pdf/S-1994-631.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/631</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I should like to draw members' attention to the following other documents: <a href="../pdf/S-1994-601.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/601</a>, note by the Secretary-General, transmitting a letter dated 19 May 1994 from the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) addressed to the Secretary-General; <a href="../pdf/S-1994-513.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/513</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1994-540.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/540</a>, letters dated 28 April and 5 May 1994 respectively, from the Permanent Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Members of the Council have also received photocopies of a letter dated 30 May 1994 from the Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, which will be issued as <a href="../pdf/S-1994-634.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/634</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council recalls the statements made by the President of the Council on 8 April 1993 (<a href="../pdf/S-25562.pdf" class="nolink">S/25562</a>) and 31 March 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-13.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/13</a>) and its relevant resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Council has noted the fact that the DPRK has allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to complete the inspection activities agreed between the IAEA and the DPRK on 15 February 1994, thus taking one step in fulfilling its obligations under the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement and in honouring its non-proliferation obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Council reaffirms the critical importance of IAEA safeguards in the implementation of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the contribution which progress in non-proliferation makes to the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Council has considered the letter from the Director General of the IAEA to the Secretary-General dated 27 May 1994, and is gravely concerned by the IAEA's assessment that if the discharge operation at the five megawatt reactor continues at the same rate, the IAEA's opportunity to select, segregate and secure fuel rods for later measurements in accordance with IAEA standards will be lost within days.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;The Council strongly urges the DPRK only to proceed with the discharge operations at the five megawatt reactor in a manner which preserves the technical possibility of fuel measurements, in accordance with the IAEA's requirements in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">&quot;The Council calls for immediate consultations between the IAEA and the DPRK on the necessary technical measures.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">&quot;The Council requests the Director General of the IAEA to maintain IAEA inspectors in the DPRK to monitor activities at the five megawatt reactor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">&quot;The Council decides to remain actively seized of the matter and that further Security Council consideration will take place if necessary in order to achieve full implementation of the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-28.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/28</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
