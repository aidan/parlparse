	<div class="p">As was announced at the 43rd plenary meeting, on 27 October 2004, the General Assembly will first proceed to a by-election to elect a member of the Economic and Social Council, in accordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure.</div>
	<div class="p">In that regard, I should like to draw the attention of members to document <a href="../pdf/A/59/358">A/59/358</a>, containing a letter dated 25 August 2004 from the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations. In his letter, the Permanent Representative of Greece announces that Greece would like to relinquish its seat on the Economic and Social Council during 2005 in favour of Spain.</div>
	<div class="p">As a result, a vacancy will occur and a new member must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired term of office of Greece, commencing on 1 January 2005 and expiring on 31 December 2005.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI), of 20 December 1971, and taking into account that the vacancy will occur from among the Group of Western European and other States, the new member should therefore be elected from that region.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to inform the members of the General Assembly that the candidate who receives a two-thirds majority of members present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote, there will be a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates who have obtained an equal number of votes.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="1-12">

	<div class="p">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.</div>
	<div class="p">Regarding the vacancy, the Chairman of the Group of Western European and other States for the month of August has informed the Secretariat that the Group has endorsed Spain.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to inform members that, as of 1 January 2005, the following States from the Group of Western European and other States will be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Turkey and the United States of America. The names of those eight States should therefore not appear on the ballot.</div>
	<div class="p">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">We shall now begin the voting process.</div>
	<div class="p">Ballot papers will now be distributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot papers and to write on them the name of the one State for which they wish to vote. A ballot paper containing more than one name from the region will be declared invalid. The name of a Member State on a ballot paper that does not belong to that region will not be counted at all.</div>

	<div class="p">Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, Spain has thus been elected a member of the Economic and Social Council for a term of office beginning on 1 January 2005 and ending on 31 December 2005.</div>
	<div class="p">I congratulate Spain, which has been elected a member of the Economic and Social Council.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly will next turn to the election of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2004. The 18 outgoing members are: Australia, Bhutan, Burundi, Chile, China, El Salvador, Finland, Ghana, Guatemala, Hungary, India, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Qatar, the Russian Federation, Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Ukraine and Zimbabwe. Members will recall that Greece relinquished its seat on the Economic and Social Council, effective 1 January 2005, and that Spain has just been elected to fill that vacancy.</div>
	<div class="p">As of 1 January 2005, the following States will be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Canada, Colombia, Congo, Cuba, Ecuador, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Republic of Tanzania and the United States of America. The names of these 36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account the number of States that will remain members of the Council after 1 January 2005, the 18 members should be elected as follows: four from the Group of African States, four from the Group of Asian States, three from the Group of Eastern European States, three from the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States and four from the Group of Western European and other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, who receive the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of members present and voting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</div>
