	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Those States are eligible for immediate re-election.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">I should like to remind members that, after 1 January 2005, the following States will still be members of the Committee: Argentina, Armenia, the Bahamas, Benin, Brazil, Canada, the Central African Republic, the Comoros, Cuba, France, Gabon, Germany, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Pakistan, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">Therefore, those 27 States are not eligible in this election.</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa10">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.

	<p id="pg003-bk08-pa01">On behalf of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Timor-Leste and Sao Tome and Principe, I have the honour to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.14.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/59/L.14</a> under agenda item 56 (t), entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries".</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk08-pa02">The Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) was founded on 17 July 1996 and became a United Nations observer on 18 November 1999. The CPLP brings together 240 million people in eight countries on four continents. Its member States belong to regional organizations such as the European Union, the African Union, the Organization of American States and the Association of South-East Asian Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk08-pa03">The CPLP is devoting special attention to the political situation in Guinea-Bissau. Last week, the CPLP Council of Ministers met in Lisbon and decided to establish a temporary CPLP office in Guinea-Bissau. That office will assist Guinea-Bissau in its national dialogue and reconciliation and also in determining its specific and urgent needs so that the country can return to the path of stability.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk08-pa04">In collaboration with the Economic Community of West African States and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Guinea-Bissau, we are helping to rebuild confidence at the national level. The CPLP is certain that the United Nations and the regional organizations to which Guinea-Bissau belongs will work in close cooperation to rescue the country from the cycle of violence, poverty, instability and isolation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk08-pa05">The actions of the CPLP demonstrate that we have been implementing the rules of multilateralism and have been cooperating with the United Nations. Now we want to formalize that role and broaden that cooperation by contributing to development and international security. For example, we would like to see the establishment of fruitful cooperation with the United Nations, so that the CPLP can contribute to the implementation of the goals of the Millennium Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk08-pa06">In operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution, the General Assembly invites the Secretary-General to undertake consultations with the Executive Secretary of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, with a view to promoting cooperation between the two secretariats. In that regard, joint efforts aimed at political facilitation, such as in Guinea-Bissau, constitute one area that could be explored.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk08-pa07">In operative paragraph 2, the Assembly requests the specialized agencies and other bodies and programmes of the United Nations to cooperate to this end with the Secretary-General and the Executive Secretary of the CPLP. I wish to draw the attention of members to the fact that the CPLP has already signed cooperation agreements with a number of United Nations organs and agencies -- namely, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Food Programme and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development -- but that much more work remains to be done.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk08-pa08">Finally, the draft resolution asks the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation of the present resolution to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk08-pa09">The members of the CPLP are introducing this draft resolution to the Assembly for its consideration. Our delegations thank all Member States for considering the draft resolution. We hope that it will be adopted by consensus.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">Lebanon -- which had the honour to host the Ninth Summit of la Francophonie in 2002, devoted to the theme "Dialogue of cultures" -- remains faithful to its francophone heritage and will continue to play its role in the International Organization of la Francophonie (IOF).</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">I should like to thank the Secretary-General for the high quality of his report (<a href="../pdf/A-59-303.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/303</a>) submitted under agenda item 56, entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations" -- particularly section X of the report, on the International Organization of la Francophonie. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General of the IOF for his constant efforts to promote both the role of the IOF and the development of its relations with the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The draft resolution before us was sponsored by 77 countries. It includes a 10-paragraph preambular part and a 16-paragraph operative part. The preambular part reflects the importance of regional cooperation in multilateral relations and the establishment and development of democracy, as well as respect for the dialogue among civilizations and for cultural and linguistic diversity. It recalls the importance of the fight against poverty and the principles on which cooperation between the IOF and the United Nations is based.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">The operative part underscores the positive participation of the IOF in the work of the United Nations and the cooperation between the two organizations in conflict prevention and other fields of mutual interest, as well as the role of the IOF in international conferences, under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">The operative part also welcomes the fact that the tenth summit conference of la Francophonie will be devoted to solidarity for sustainable development. It reflects the cooperation that exists between the IOF and the United Nations and between the IOF and the specialized agencies of the United Nations system to promote development and the elimination of poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Lastly, on behalf of the sponsors, it is my pleasure to invite the General Assembly to give its full support to <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.19.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/59/L.19</a>.</p>
