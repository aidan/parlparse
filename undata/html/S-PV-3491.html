	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1995-28.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/28</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 12 January 1995 from the Permanent Representative of Croatia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council, which has begun its consideration of the Secretary-General's report of 14 January 1995 submitted pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-947(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 947 (1994)</a> (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-38.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/38</a>), has learned with concern of the position adopted by the Republic of Croatia on the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Croatia beyond 31 March 1995, as set out in the letter from the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Croatia to the Secretary-General of 12 January 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-28.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/28</a>). It is particularly concerned about the wider implications of this development for the peace process throughout the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders. It understands the concerns of the Croatian Government about the lack of implementation of major provisions of the United Nations Peace-keeping Plan for Croatia. It will not accept the status quo becoming an indefinite situation. It believes, however, that UNPROFOR's continued presence in the Republic of Croatia is of vital importance for regional peace and security, and that the United Nations in general and UNPROFOR in particular have a positive role to play in achieving the further implementation of the Peace-keeping Plan and bringing about a settlement which ensures full respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia. It recalls the important role UNPROFOR plays in helping to sustain the cease-fire in Croatia, facilitating humanitarian activities and international relief work, and supporting implementation of the Economic Agreement of 2 December 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1375.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1375</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"It is in that perspective that the Security Council hopes that discussions over the weeks ahead will lead to a re-examination of the position now taken in relation to the continuing role of UNPROFOR in the Republic of Croatia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"Meanwhile, the Security Council calls upon all parties and others concerned to avoid any action or statement which might lead to an increase in tension. It welcomes the conclusion, under the auspices of the Co-Chairmen of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, of the Economic Agreement of 2 December 1994, and urges the parties to continue, and accelerate, its implementation; it notes the need for adequate international financial support, and encourages the international community to respond to this need. It calls for the intensification in the coming weeks of all these efforts to consolidate this achievement and to bring about a political settlement in Croatia, and it also calls upon the parties to cooperate with these efforts and to negotiate in earnest to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council affirms its commitment to the search for an overall negotiated settlement of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia ensuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States there within their internationally recognized borders, and stresses the importance it attaches to the mutual recognition thereof."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-2.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/2</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
