	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa01">This morning the General Assembly will proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1998.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa02">The five non-permanent outgoing members are the following: Costa Rica, Japan, Kenya, Portugal and Sweden. Those five States cannot be re-elected and therefore their names should not appear on the ballot papers.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in 1999 the following States: Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, the Gambia and Slovenia. The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot papers.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa04">Of the five non-permanent members which will remain in office in 1999, three are from Africa and Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from Latin America and the Caribbean.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa05">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: two from Africa and Asia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean and two from Western European and other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa06">In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to be elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa and one from Asia.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa07">I should like to inform the Assembly that the number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa08">In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa09">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg001-bk04">
	It was so decided.

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa01">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa02">Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by the Chairmen of the respective regional groups that for the two vacant seats from among the African and Asian States there are two endorsed candidates, namely, Malaysia and Namibia.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa03">As for the Latin American and Caribbean States, Argentina is the endorsed candidate for one vacant seat.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa04">From among the Western European and other States, there are three candidates for two vacant seats. The candidates are Canada, Greece and the Netherlands.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01">Perhaps members are surprised that something unusual is happening today. This relates to the circumstances. A renowned scholar and lover of African literature by the name of Chinua Achebe has said, "When you see a frog crossing your path, you must know that something is behind its life".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">My delegation has asked to make a few remarks; in a way, I am uttering a prayer on behalf of my delegation, that as we elect the new members of the Security Council may God the Almighty give them wisdom as they carry out the laborious tasks that lie before them. I want also to alert them to the obstacles they will meet when they get to the Security Council. Experience during my time here dictates that they should be vigilant lest their purposes and aims be interrupted in the Security Council when they set about discharging their duties.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa03">First, as is well known, the Security Council is by no means supreme vis-à-vis the General Assembly; it is expected to be accountable to the Assembly; it is expected to be transparent in its activities. Hence, its operations should be well known to us all, including to non-members of the Council. That, according to the Charter, should be done by making the debate a public one at times. But to the dismay of my delegation, we have time and again seen meetings of the Security Council conducted behind what I may be permitted to call an iron curtain, loosely known as informal consultations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa04">When one follows matters, slowly and carefully, in the corridors, one learns that these are not just informal consultations, but meetings on matters of significance, on which we would all be as interested as members of the Security Council to make our views known.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa05">My delegation challenges the practice of informal consultations. Normal practice dictates that informal consultations in the consultations room should be followed by open meetings in which we can all request to participate in an open debate. Therefore, to my colleagues and to the Member States who will be going to the Security Council, I reiterate my preambular prayer that God Almighty give them power and courage so that the practice of informal consultations and informal meetings may come to an end, and so that the culture of the United Nations may be properly followed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa06">We are about to exercise our right to vote, and I call upon those who will be voting, which includes my delegation, to pray for the courage to vote for those who will heed all our requests. We are about to give birth to a child; if the child is born, it is expected to take instructions from the parents. So it is for the Security Council; it must take heed of the General Assembly, which is the supreme body of the United Nations.</div>
