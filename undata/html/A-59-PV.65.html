	Ms. Sotaniemi (Finland)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Today I have the honour to present to the General Assembly the reports of the Sixth Committee on the 19 substantive agenda items allocated to it, namely, items 138 to 152 and 157, 159, 160 and 162.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to draw the Assembly's attention first to agenda item 138, "Nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States". The relevant report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/504">A/59/504</a>, and the draft resolution recommended to the Assembly for adoption is reproduced in paragraph 7 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, inter alia, invite Governments to submit comments on the advisability of drafting a legal instrument on the nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States and would decide to consider the agenda item again at its sixty-third session.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will be in a position to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to the report of the Sixth Committee on agenda item 139, "Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/505">A/59/505</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution reproduced in paragraph 6 of the report, the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General to invite States to submit comments on any future action to be taken with regard to the articles on State responsibility. The Secretary-General would also be requested to prepare an initial compilation of decisions of international courts, tribunals and other bodies referring to the articles and to invite Governments to submit information on their practice in that regard. In addition, the Assembly would decide to include the item in its provisional agenda for the sixty-second session.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now invite the attention of the Assembly to agenda item 140, "Status of the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts". The relevant report of the Sixth Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/506">A/59/506</a>, and the draft resolution that the Committee recommends to the General Assembly for adoption is set out in paragraph 7 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, in particular, call upon all States parties to the Geneva Conventions that have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to the Additional Protocols at the earliest possible date; call upon all States that are already parties to Protocol I, or those States not parties, on becoming parties to Protocol I, to make the declaration provided for under article 90 of that Protocol; and call upon all States that have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the two Protocols thereto, and to other relevant treaties on international humanitarian law relating to the protection of victims of armed conflict.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote, and it is hoped that the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to agenda item 141, "Consideration of effective measures to enhance the protection, security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives". The relevant report of the Sixth Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/507">A/59/507</a>, and the draft resolution that the Committee recommends to the Assembly for adoption is set out in paragraph 7 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, inter alia, strongly condemn all acts of violence against diplomatic and consular missions and representatives, as well as against missions and representatives of international intergovernmental organizations and officials of such organizations, and urge States to take all necessary measures at the national and international levels to prevent any such acts of violence and to ensure, with the participation of the United Nations where appropriate, that such acts are fully investigated with a view to bringing offenders to justice.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote, and the Assembly may wish to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now invite the attention of members to agenda item 142, "Convention on jurisdictional immunities of States and their property". The relevant report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/508">A/59/508</a>, and the draft resolution recommended to the General Assembly for adoption is reproduced in paragraph 9 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">I am pleased to note that the draft resolution contains, in its annex, the text of the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property. Under the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would adopt the Convention and invite States to become parties to it.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with the draft resolution, the General Assembly would agree with the general understanding reached in the Ad Hoc Committee on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property that the Convention does not cover criminal proceedings. In accordance with its articles 28 and 33, the Convention shall be open for signature by all States from 17 January 2005 until 17 January 2007.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will be in a position to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to the report of the Sixth Committee on agenda item 143, "Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its thirty-seventh session". The report of the Sixth Committee on that agenda item is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/509">A/59/509</a>, and the two draft resolutions recommended to the Assembly for adoption are contained in paragraph 10 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of draft resolution I, entitled "Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its thirty-seventh session", the General Assembly would, among other things, appeal to relevant international and regional organizations to coordinate their legal activities with those of the Commission, to avoid duplication of efforts and to promote efficiency, consistency and coherence in the modernization and harmonization of international trade law. It would also reaffirm the importance, in particular for developing countries, of the work of the Commission concerned with training and legislative technical assistance in the field of international trade law and would, in that connection, appeal to Governments, the relevant bodies of the United Nations system, organizations, institutions and individuals to support the training and legislative technical assistance programme of the Commission and to make voluntary contributions to the relevant trust fund.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would welcome the Commission's consideration of the means of actively engaging non-State actors in its work and would encourage the Commission to further explore different approaches to the use of partnerships with non-State actors in the implementation of its mandate. The Assembly would also express its appreciation for the preparation of a digest of case law on the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the operative paragraphs of draft resolution II, entitled "Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law", the General Assembly would express its appreciation to the Commission for the completion and adoption of the Legislative Guide and request the Secretary-General to publish it. Furthermore, the Assembly would recommend that all States give due consideration to the Legislative Guide when revising or adopting their relevant legislation.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted those two draft resolutions without a vote, and it is hoped that the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to agenda item 144, entitled "Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-sixth session". The relevant report of the Sixth Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/510">A/59/510</a>, and the draft resolution recommended to the General Assembly for adoption is contained in paragraph 8 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would, inter alia, take note of the report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-sixth session and recommend that the Commission continue its work on the topics in its current programme, taking into account the comments and observations of Governments. The Assembly would also express its appreciation to the International Law Commission for the work accomplished at its fifty-sixth session, in particular for the completion of the first reading of draft articles on diplomatic protection and of the draft principles on the allocation of loss in the case of transboundary harm arising out of hazardous activities.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would draw the attention of Governments to the importance for the International Law Commission of having their views on the various aspects involved in the topics on the agenda of the Commission, particularly with regard to the draft articles and commentary on diplomatic protection and the draft principles on allocation of loss in the case of transboundary harm arising out of hazardous activities.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would reiterate the invitation to Governments to provide information regarding State practice on the topic "Unilateral acts of States", and would invite Governments to provide information regarding their practice, bilateral or regional, relating to the allocation of groundwaters from transboundary aquifer systems and the management of non-renewable transboundary aquifer systems relating to the topic currently entitled "Shared natural resources".</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would endorse the decision of the International Law Commission to include in its agenda the topics "Expulsion of aliens" and "Effects of armed conflicts on treaties". Moreover, it would take note of paragraphs 362 and 363 of the report of the International Law Commission with regard to its long-term programme of work and the syllabus on the new topic annexed to the report.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would encourage Member States to consider being represented at the level of legal adviser during the first week in which the report of the International Law Commission is discussed in the Sixth Committee -- the so-called International Law Week -- to enable high-level discussions on issues of international law.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly would also invite the Commission to continue taking measures to enhance its efficiency and productivity and would encourage the Commission to continue taking cost-saving measures at its future sessions. Furthermore, it would approve the conclusions of the Commission regarding summary records of the Commission and reaffirm its previous decisions concerning the documentation and summary records of the International Law Commission.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, the General Assembly would decide that the next session of the Commission will be held at the United Nations Office at Geneva from 2 May to 3 June and from 4 July to 5 August 2005.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote, and it is hoped that the General Assembly will do likewise.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me now turn to agenda item 145, "Report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country". The report of the Sixth Committee on this item is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/511">A/59/511</a>. The draft resolution recommended to the Assembly for adoption is set out in paragraph 8 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, inter alia, endorse the recommendations and conclusions of the Host Country Committee; consider that the maintenance of appropriate conditions for the normal work of the delegations and the missions accredited to the United Nations and the observance of their privileges and immunities are in the interest of the Organization and all Member States; and request the host country to continue to solve, through negotiations, problems that might arise and to take all measures necessary to prevent any interference with the functioning of missions.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote. It is hoped that the Assembly will be in a position to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me now to turn to the report of the Sixth Committee concerning agenda item 146, "International Criminal Court". The report is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/512">A/59/512</a>. The draft resolution recommended to the General Assembly for adoption is found in paragraph 8 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, inter alia, call upon all States that are not yet parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to consider ratifying or acceding to it without delay and would encourage efforts aimed at promoting awareness of the results of the Rome Conference and the provisions of the Rome Statute.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for providing effective and efficient assistance in the establishment of the Court. The Assembly would also decide to include in the provisional agenda of its sixtieth session the item entitled "Report of the International Criminal Court", under which it would consider, with the Court invited to attend and participate, any report of the Court that may be submitted to the Assembly pursuant to article 6 of the Relationship Agreement between the United Nations and the International Criminal Court.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and the Assembly may wish to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now draw the attention of the Assembly to agenda item 147, "Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization". The report of the Sixth Committee on this item is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/513">A/59/513</a>. The two draft resolutions recommended to the General Assembly for adoption are contained in paragraph 11 of the report.</div>
	<div class="p">By terms of draft resolution I, entitled "Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization", the General Assembly would, among other things, request the Special Committee, at its next session in 2005, to continue its consideration of all proposals concerning the question of the maintenance of international peace and security in all its aspects in order to strengthen the role of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">The Special Committee would also be requested to continue to consider, on a priority basis, the question of the implementation of the provisions of the Charter related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter and, also on a priority basis, to continue to consider ways and means of improving its working methods and enhancing its efficiency with a view to identifying widely acceptable measures for future implementation.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would endorse the Secretary-General's efforts to eliminate the backlog of the  <i>Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council</i> and would request the Secretary-General to establish a trust fund to eliminate the backlog of the <i>Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs</i>, which would accept voluntary contributions by States, private institutions and individuals. It would also request the Secretary-General to submit a report on both publications to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.</div>
	<div class="p">By the provisions of draft resolution II, entitled "Implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions", the Assembly would, inter alia, decide to consider, within the Sixth Committee or a working group of the Committee, at the Assembly's sixtieth session, further progress in the elaboration of effective measures aimed at the implementation of the provisions of the Charter related to assistance to third States affected by sanctions.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted these two draft resolutions without a vote. The Assembly may wish to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to agenda item 148, "Measures to eliminate international terrorism". The report of the Sixth Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/514">A/59/514</a>. The draft resolution recommended to the Assembly for adoption is set out in paragraph 11 thereof.</div>

	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would decide that the Ad Hoc Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/A/RES/51/210">resolution 51/210</a> of 17 December 1996 would, on an expedited basis, continue to elaborate a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism and resolve the outstanding issues relating to the elaboration of the draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. The Ad Hoc Committee would also keep on its agenda the question of convening a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations to formulate a joint organized response of the international community to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. For these purposes, the Ad Hoc Committee would meet from 28 March to 1 April 2005, and if necessary, its work would also continue during the sixtieth session of the Assembly, within the framework of the Working Group of the Sixth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would also request the Secretary-General to make a comprehensive inventory of the response of the Secretariat to terrorism as part of his report on measures to eliminate international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote. It is hoped the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to the report of the Sixth Committee on agenda item 149, "Scope of legal protection under the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/515">A/59/515</a> and Corr.1. The draft resolution which the Sixth Committee recommends to the Assembly for adoption is set out in paragraph 10 of the report.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, among other things, urge States to take all necessary measures, in accordance with their international obligations, to prevent crimes against United Nations and associated personnel from occurring, and to ensure that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would recommend that the Secretary-General continue to seek inclusion of, and that the host countries include, key provisions of the Convention, in future as well as, if necessary, in existing status-of-forces, status-of-mission and host country agreements. It would further recommend that the Secretary-General, consistent with his existing authority, advise the Security Council or the General Assembly, as appropriate, where in his assessment circumstances would support a declaration of exceptional risk for the purposes of article 1 (c) (ii) of the Convention.</div>
	<div class="p">The next meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A/RES/56/89">resolution 56/89</a> would be held from 11 to 15 April 2005. The Ad Hoc Committee's mandate would be to expand the scope of the legal protection under the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, including, inter alia, by means of a legal instrument.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will be in a position to act likewise.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to agenda item 150, "International convention against the reproductive cloning of human beings". The report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/516">A/59/516</a>, and the draft decision recommended by the Committee to the Assembly is to be found in paragraph 11 thereof.

	Mr. Van den Berg (Netherlands)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I speak on behalf of the European Union. The candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Croatia, the country of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidate Serbia and Montenegro, and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this declaration.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union welcomes the adoption of the draft resolution on the International Criminal Court (ICC) by the Sixth Committee without a vote and welcomes its adoption by the General Assembly in the same manner. We consider it essential that the ICC remain on the agenda of the General Assembly, certainly now that the Relationship Agreement between the United Nations and the ICC has entered into force. The Relationship Agreement must now be translated into practical cooperation, the process of which the European Union will promote and closely follow.</div>
	<div class="p">We also support the continuing exchange of information between the Court and the General Assembly. That exchange will also happen through annual reports on the Court's activities, which will be submitted to the regular session of the Assembly. Also, it is important to note that the Court will participate, as an observer, in the work of the General Assembly, including in the debates on the reports. The resolution reaffirms the observer status of the ICC to the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union has relentlessly defended the integrity of the Rome Statute and will continue to do so. The ICC is beyond doubt the most significant recent development in the long struggle to advance the cause of justice and rule of law, thereby eradicating impunity. The European Union reaffirms its determination to obtain the widest possible international support for the ICC, inter alia, by widening adherence to the Rome Statute -- whose signatories now comprise more than half of the United Nations membership -- and to the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the ICC.</div>
	<div class="p">At times, concerns about the Court are still voiced. Those concerns are unfounded; the Rome Statute provides all necessary safeguards against the use of the Court for politically motivated purposes. The Rome Statute contains the most comprehensive list of due process protections which has thus far been promulgated. Its prosecutors and judges are selected by and from countries committed to justice, human rights and democracy.</div>
	<div class="p">The Rome Statute, together with the Elements of Crime, defines the crimes falling under the Court's jurisdiction -- genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity -- with an amount of clarity and precision unmatched by the statute of any other tribunal. The Court's jurisdiction is only complementary to national criminal jurisdictions, and the Rome Statute limits the ICC to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole. The Court may assume jurisdiction only when a State is unable or unwilling to do so. The European Union is satisfied that the ICC establishes the highest standards of competence, fairness, due process and international justice and will continue to endeavour to secure those standards.</div>
	<div class="p">Among others, the European Union has developed a set of principles to serve as guidelines for Member States when drafting bilateral agreements defining the conditions under which persons will be surrendered to the Court. The European Union will continue to draw attention to those guiding principles. The guidelines provide, inter alia, for the following.</div>
	<div class="p">First, given the scope of existing international agreements, such as the status-of-forces agreements and agreements on legal cooperation on criminal matters, including extradition, new agreements often serve no legal purpose. This should be taken into account.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, the agreements that were presented to us as drafted by the United States are inconsistent with obligations of States parties to the ICC with regard to the ICC Statute, and possibly also with regard to other international agreements to which ICC States parties are also parties.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, the scope of persons covered by such agreements must not be excessive. It must be limited to persons who have actually been sent by a State on official business. That means that no private business people or mere tourists would be subject to adjudication.</div>
	<div class="p">Fourthly, agreements should contain a sunset clause.</div>
	<div class="p">Last and most importantly, such agreements should not result in impunity.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union, in line with its Council Common Position on the International Criminal Court and its Action Plan, stands ready to help those States that might need assistance in ensuring that crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the Court do not enjoy impunity.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union expresses the hope that the United States will continue to work together with its allies and partners in developing effective and impartial international justice. To that end, the European Union remains available to develop a broader dialogue on all matters relating to the ICC, including future relations between the United States and the Court.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have the honour to address the General Assembly on behalf of the member States of the Andean Community -- Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela -- in order to submit for consideration by the plenary draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A/59/L.20/Rev.1">A/59/L.20/Rev.1</a>, entitled "Andean Zone of Peace".</div>
	<div class="p">The Andean Zone of Peace was established by the presidential Declaration of San Francisco de Quito on 12 July 2004 and covers the territories, airspace and waters under the sovereignty of the Andean countries. It is the result of one of the most advanced processes aimed at bringing about a genuine area of peace and security on the American continent.</div>
	<div class="p">The Andean Zone of Peace is the culmination of important processes aimed at strengthening security in the Andean subregion, such as the Lima Commitment of 17 June 2002 on the limitation, control and transparency of expenditures related to conventional weapons; the "Andean Plan to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects" of June 2003; and decision 587 of July 2004, containing the Andean Common External Security Policy Guidelines.</div>
	<div class="p">The main objectives of the Andean Zone of Peace are the following: first, to prohibit weapons of mass destruction and their transit through the subregion, as well as the definitive eradication of anti-personnel landmines; secondly, to design and implement an Andean programme aimed at confidence-building and strengthening security; thirdly, to promote the participation of Andean countries in United Nations peacekeeping operations; fourthly, to ensure compliance with the prohibition of the use or threat of use of force between Member States; and, fifthly, to promote the prevention and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, whatever their nature.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution is the outcome of negotiations among the five Andean countries and those delegations that have made suggestions in order to improve the text.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to make a slight oral amendment to the text of the draft resolution. It has to do with a mistake that was made in the translation into English of the original Spanish text. In the fifth preambular paragraph in the English version, in the third line, we should include the word "overcoming" before the word "poverty" and then delete the word "eradication", so the sentence would then read "Overcoming poverty, social exclusion and inequity".</div>
	<div class="p">Having said this, given that the new zone of peace coincides fully with the principles and objectives that form the very foundation of the Charter of the United Nations, I would ask the General Assembly, on behalf of the Andean countries, to recognize this peace initiative and to approve it by consensus.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It is an honour for me to address the plenary at the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly with regard to agenda item 161, whose inclusion in the agenda was requested by Peru.</div>
	<div class="p">My country, along with Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, is a sponsor of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A/59/L.20/Rev.1">A/59/L.20/Rev.1</a> which welcomes the Declaration of San Francisco de Quito on the Establishment and Development on the Andean Zone of Peace, signed on 12 July 2004. In this Declaration, our Presidents agreed to establish a zone of peace in the Andean Community with precise objectives and concrete guidelines.</div>
	<div class="p">The Declaration recognizes that peace, security, the full force of democracy and the rule of law are necessary conditions to reach higher levels of political, economic and social development in our countries. Therefore agreements such as the Andean Common External Security Policy are fundamental parts of our integration process. We are also committed to designing and implementing an Andean Programme for Security and Confidence-Building.</div>
	<div class="p">Colombia welcomes the definitive solution to territorial disputes among the countries of our subregion, which has allowed us to make the Declaration on the Andean Zone of Peace. Nevertheless, our democratic stability and the integrity of the political, economic and social structures of our countries still face grave threats like the illicit drugs problem; terrorism, corruption and extreme poverty. That is why we are working together to strengthen our democracies with the ongoing promotion and defence of the rule of law, human rights and the sustainable and equitable development of our peoples. Together, we will be able to achieve success in the struggle against transnational threats.</div>
	<div class="p">Among the objectives of the Andean Zone of Peace that we hope the General Assembly will welcome today, we included the ban on the use or threat to use force between member States, as well as the consolidation of a democratic, cooperative and non-offensive conception of security in our subregion. For the Government of Colombia, committed to the implementation of a democratic security and defence strategy to fight terrorism and the world illicit drug problem that finance it, cooperation from the international community and the Andean subregion is fundamental. That is why we underline the Declaration's commitment to develop and strengthen legal, judicial and police cooperation with the goal of contributing to create a common space for citizens' security and justice.</div>
	<div class="p">Colombia contributes to the Andean Zone of Peace with a democratic defence and national security strategy that aims to consolidate the rule of law and to guarantee the human rights of all Colombians. This includes our farmers, so that they are not forcefully displaced from their land; our businessmen, so that they are not victims of kidnapping; our journalists, so that they are not threatened; our labour leaders, so that they can exercise their action freely; and our human rights defenders, so that they can work without intimidation. The democratic security policy protects all citizens of a pluralist nation, open to fraternal and creative debate, that counts on the solidarity of its Andean brothers in its fight against violence and terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Today we welcome the Andean Zone of Peace as a firm commitment in the fight against threats to the security of our States, as well as the consolidation of the fraternal and cooperative relations that exist among our peoples and governments -- a commitment for action, coordination, and concerted common strategies in order to face serious threats to the security of our countries and the stability of our region together.</div>
	<div class="p">Therefore, I would like to conclude this speech by underlining the fundamental role that regional and subregional organizations can play in maintaining international peace and security, as well as in achieving the economic and social development of the peoples of the world. Today, when many doubt the effectiveness of multilateralism to face the threats and challenges of the twenty-first century it is enough to take a look at regional and subregional organizations around the globe to see that multilateralism maintains its full force and that States' commitment in strengthening it should be progressively stronger.</div>
	<div class="p">I call upon the United Nations to recognize and make use of regional and subregional organizations' exceptional capacity to contribute to building a more pacific and just international scenario, where security and development are achieved to face successfully threats and challenges of today's world. Regional and subregional organizations, taking into account the spirit of harmony and understanding among their member States, their geographic proximity and common values, are exceptional forums for widening and strengthening cooperation, solving conflicts and mobilizing regional solidarity on fundamental topics. The Organization of American States (OAS) and the Andean Community are good examples in our hemisphere of the potential of regional and subregional organizations.</div>

	<div class="p">The fifteenth Andean Presidential Council, which brought together Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and my country, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, instructed the Foreign Ministers of our countries, through the mandate of the Declaration of San Francisco de Quito, to include an additional subject on the agenda of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, namely, the Andean Zone of Peace. The progress in this peace process between our countries is a further link in our path towards reciprocal peace and security, which strengthens the harmonious development of the community and protects us from threats to our security and vulnerability to our territories and peoples.</div>
	<div class="p">In this respect, it also represents a contribution to overcoming poverty. It promotes social inclusion and therefore constitutes an adequate environment to overcome social injustices. Likewise, it also helps to promote trust between our peoples, to improve coordination of activities and it will facilitate the adoption of specific measures to solve subregional conflicts, whatever be their nature or cause.</div>
	<div class="p">We consider that this initiative of the Andean Zone of Peace is part of a complementary process to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, as well as other important disarmament measures to which Venezuela is a party and which have as their basis the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of the Organization of American States.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, I would like to thank the President for having included this subject on the General Assembly agenda. We would also like to point out that the provisions contained in the draft resolution are only binding on the parties involved, and we therefore hope that the resolution can be adopted by consensus.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Araníbar Quiroga" nation="Bolivia" language="Spanish">
	Mr. Araníbar Quiroga (Bolivia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me, on the occasion of the adoption of the draft resolution on the Andean Zone of Peace, to refer to the Declaration of San Francisco de Quito on the Establishment and Development of the Andean Zone of Peace, adopted on 12 July 2004 by the Presidents of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela within the framework of the fifteenth Meeting of the Andean Presidential Council.</div>
	<div class="p">The idea of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, zones of peace and denuclearized zones has been gaining favour among many States of the international community and has spread to various regions of the world. It has travelled beyond national borders and crossed oceans and seas, taking root on various continents, regions and subregions in a sort of chain reaction that continues to spread until the process is complete.</div>
	<div class="p">This ambition seems consonant with the goal of general and complete disarmament, as it is guided by the innate desire of human beings to live in genuine peace and security, to eradicate the scourge of war and to free up economic, intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits and the needs of development.</div>
	<div class="p">This concern is not foreign to the American continent. It was expressed clearly on 29 April 1963, when Bolivia, together with Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico, issued a declaration proclaiming their readiness to sign a multilateral agreement establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone with the aim of reducing the threat of nuclear war. Without doubt, the subsequent adoption of the Tlatelolco Treaty in 1967, which declared Latin America and the Caribbean to be a nuclear-weapon-free zone, constituted the first link in the chain. In that context, we note with satisfaction that its message has spread. Nuclear-weapon-free zones, zones of peace and denuclearized zones, although they have different specific strategic meanings, are all aimed at achieving similar objectives and respond to an issue of great interest in the prevailing world situation.</div>
	<div class="p">It is useful to note the opinion of United Nations experts responsible for studying this question, who have said that the establishment of zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones should not be considered an end in itself; rather, it should be seen as ways of achieving the objective of general and complete disarmament in order to ensure genuine peace and international security. Our new, multidimensional concept of security should guide us, within the framework of respect for international law, the protection of human rights and the defence of democracy, which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the charter of the Organization of American States.</div>
	<div class="p">A clear threat to the legally elected Governments of our region is posed by disturbing phenomena characteristic of the international situation today, namely, the increase in armed conflicts, terrorist acts and trafficking in human beings and arms, as well as the increase in transnational organized crime, drug trafficking and money laundering.</div>
	<div class="p">In that context, the establishment of the Andean Zone of Peace marks an important milestone in the strengthening and the deepening of Andean and South American integration and reflects the common will of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela to prohibit not only nuclear, chemical, biological and toxin weapons and their transit through the airspace and the waters under their respective sovereignty and jurisdiction, but also to carry out the total eradication of anti-personnel mines.</div>
	<div class="p">The Andean Zone of Peace represents the consolidation of initiatives previously undertaken in the area of security, such as the 1989 Galapagos Declaration, the 2002 Lima Commitment, the Andean Plan to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects of June 2003 and Decision 587 of July 2004, containing the Andean Common External Policy guidelines. The countries of the Andean Zone of Peace will continue their efforts to prevent and combat threats to security, strengthen and revitalize democracy, enhance cooperation for integrated development and continuously seek a more just and equitable international order.</div>
	<div class="p">Bolivia, from a perspective of integration consistent with its peace-oriented foreign policy guidelines, has sought to unite its efforts with those of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela to establish the Andean Zone of Peace, convinced that peace, democratic stability and collective security will have a positive impact on the entire process of South American integration.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe it important to make progress in education for peace and disarmament and in the promotion of a democratic culture, with the aim of creating conditions that will help us achieve our historical aspirations and thus overcome problems that continue to negatively impact the comprehensive development of the subregion and the establishment of true multilateralism.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I would like to underline that in order to effectively consolidate the Andean Zone of Peace, it is absolutely necessary to make progress in overcoming poverty and inequality and to find peaceful solutions to disputes, demonstrating through our actions that peace and security are an essential part of the process of subregional integration and, from the broader perspective of a renewed and emerging reality, of South American integration.</div>
	<div class="p">My country therefore urges the General Assembly to adopt by consensus draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A/59/L.20/Rev.1">A/59/L.20/Rev.1</a>, introduced by the member States of the Andean Community.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">My delegation would like to take this occasion to refer to the Declaration of San Francisco de Quito on the Establishment and Development of the Andean Zone of Peace, adopted in the city of Quito, Ecuador, on 12 July 2004, by the heads of State of the member countries of the Andean Community within the framework of the fifteenth Meeting of the Andean Presidential Council. We stress the importance that Ecuador attaches to the zone of peace that the Declaration created in the sovereign areas of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.</div>
	<div class="p">It is evident that the Andean countries, conscious of their common history and the similar challenges they face in the current situation of the international community, and in a clear demonstration of their firm belief that peace and security constitute the foundations for development, stability and the rule of law, deem it essential to further strengthen the South American zone of peace and cooperation approved by the Presidents of South America at their second meeting, in Guayaquil, Ecuador on 27 July 2002, which was subsequently welcomed by the General Assembly in its <a href="../pdf/A/RES/57/13">resolution 57/13</a> of 14 November 2002.</div>
	<div class="p">Ecuador is convinced that the Andean nations will be able to contribute to the economic development and the overall well-being of their peoples on the basis of a clear political will to work with one accord to strengthen the climate of mutual trust and to consolidate a zone of peace free of weapons of mass destruction, that prohibits transit of those weapons through the region, a zone free of anti-personnel mines. We will work to achieve transparency and the gradual limitation in the acquisition of weapons.</div>
	<div class="p">Ecuador is allied with those nations that cherish peace and international law. Its foreign policy is guided by the principles laid down in article 4 of its Constitution, among which I note those pertaining to the legal equality of States, the condemnation of the use or the threat of the use of force as a means of resolving conflicts, the disavowal of claiming a legal basis for the spoils of war, the recognition that international law constitutes a standard of conduct for relations among States, the promotion of the settlement of disputes by legal and peaceful means, and peace and cooperation as the basis of coexistence among nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Conscious of its responsibilities as a member of the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the Andean Community, Ecuador stands ready, with profound conviction and determination, to contribute to the best of its ability to the maintenance of peace and security in the Andean subregion, in South America and throughout the world.</div>
	<div class="p">As the heads of State of the Rio Group declared on 5 November at the conclusion of the summit of Rio de Janeiro, only a multilateral approach to global problems and threats to international peace and security and full respect for international law will enable us, with a new spirit of international cooperation, to achieve peace, development and social inclusion.</div>
	<div class="p">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A/59/L.20/Rev.1">A/59/L.20/Rev.1</a>, submitted today for consideration, stresses in its preambular part the progress that the members of the Andean Community of nations have achieved in matters of security, peace and confidence-building, as reflected in Decision 587 of the Andean Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers, entitled, the "Andean Common External Security Policy Guidelines", and in decision 552, comprising the "Andean plan to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects". As stressed in the eighth preambular paragraph of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A/59/L.20/Rev.1">A/59/L.20/Rev.1</a>, this is the first binding subregional instrument derived from the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects, adopted in 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">My country is convinced that the Andean Zone of Peace, as stated in the sixth preambular paragraph of the draft resolution, represents efforts aimed at</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"promoting growing commonality among Governments, public opinion, political parties and civil society with regard to widely shared objectives and values",</div>
	<div class="p">and it will help to promote a broadening of the already very many possibilities existing in the different areas of cooperation between the Andean nations. On the basis of mutual trust and respect, it will enable us to join efforts to face the challenges of development in an increasingly interdependent and globalized world, and it will assure our peoples of a present and a future that is full of well-being and prosperity.</div>
	<div class="p">Likewise, we feel that the Andean Zone of Peace will help us to promote the principles and norms of international law enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in the Charter of the Organization of American States.</div>
	<div class="p">That is why, given my country's deeply felt peaceful vocation and as a firm defender of the Charter of this world Organization, we will do everything possible to strengthen the Andean Zone of Peace and to firmly contribute to the preservation of peace, security and trust, not only in the Andean region, but also at the regional, hemispheric and global levels.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, my delegation, true to the steadfast principles that govern our relations with other States, would like to reiterate our support and renew our commitment to the peaceful settlement of conflicts.</div>
	<div class="p">We call upon United Nations Member States to support and adopt draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A/59/L.20/Rev.1">A/59/L.20/Rev.1</a>. on the Andean Zone of Peace, submitted for the consideration of delegations today, so that they can contribute to and cooperate with the objectives established in the Declaration of San Francisco de Quito on the Establishment and Development of the Andean Zone of Peace, adopted in Quito, on 12 July 2004.</div>

	<div class="p">Bearing this in mind, the draft resolution traditionally would have been prepared and considered in the General Assembly's Second Committee. However, in bringing the report of the Economic and Social Council to the General Assembly for consideration in plenary, this and another subject were left out of the Second Committee's programme of work. Moreover, the Secretary-General's report was submitted to the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">This is a draft resolution that is traditionally adopted by consensus by Member States in the Second Committee, and we hope that on this occasion the text presented will be approved in the same way in plenary. With a view to reaching consensus, I would like to tell Members that we have at the last minute made two slight editorial changes to the text of the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A/59/L.27/Rev.1">A/59/L.27/Rev.1</a>. The first change refers to operative paragraph 7: insert the word "and" after "23 July 2004" and delete everything following "<a href="../pdf/A/RES/58/231">resolution 58/231</a>".</div>
	<div class="p">In operative paragraph 8, we are going to make three deletions. First at the start, delete "comprehensive" where it appears before "report". Then, in the last clause, with regard to the phrase "to ensure that the major findings of that report" delete the words "major" and "of that report".</div>
	<div class="p">The corrected paragraphs would then read as follows. Operative paragraph 7 would read:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Also requests the Secretary-General to focus the work on public administration along the lines of Economic and Social Council decision 2004/302 of 23 July 2004 and General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A/RES/58/231">resolution 58/231</a>,".</div>
	<div class="p">Operative paragraph 8 would read:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Further requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session on progress made in Member States by revitalizing public administration during the last ten years, since the resumed fiftieth session of the General Assembly, on public administration and development, and to ensure that the findings are brought to the attention of Member States on the occasion of the special event in 2005".</div>
	<div class="p">The sponsors hope that the draft resolution can be adopted by consensus. That would enable us to follow up on the recommendations of the Secretary-General to prepare to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the resumed fiftieth session of the General Assembly, on public administration and development, in keeping with the principles agreed at that session.</div>
	<div class="p">I am pleased to announce that the delegation of Chile has joined the list of sponsors of this draft resolution.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Israel voted in favour of the draft resolution as a demonstration of its continued support for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. In exceedingly difficult security conditions, Israel continues to do all that it can to help the Palestinian people meet their humanitarian needs. While difficulties remain, we have consistently worked to permit the flow of food, medicine, humanitarian assistance and other necessities to Palestinian areas to the greatest extent possible.</div>
	<div class="p">We are pleased to say that this year, revenues have been transferred from Israel to the Palestinian Authority on schedule each month and account for $50 million monthly. Israel is developing a much more efficient working relationship with humanitarian organizations and with relevant Palestinian authorities on the ground. The number of roadblocks has been considerably reduced, and new operating procedures have been instituted to speed the transfer of humanitarian shipments and ambulances as well as the movement of people and goods. In addition, the implementation of the Israeli Government disengagement plan will help stabilize and improve the security and humanitarian situation for both peoples and, it is to be hoped, will jump-start the peace process.</div>
	<div class="p">Helping to end suffering and working to improve the security, welfare and prosperity of all peoples in the Middle East are crucial components of successful peace initiatives and primary objectives of the Israeli Government. Israel welcomes the efforts by Member States and international agencies to ease the hardship of innocent civilians and endeavours to facilitate humanitarian work to improve the living conditions of Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. At the same time, for such humanitarian work to be effective, it is important that it be properly coordinated with the relevant authorities and that organizations not operate without a clear mandate and agreed terms of reference.</div>
	<div class="p">We would reaffirm the importance of recognizing that terrorist activity by Palestinian groups endangers both Israeli and Palestinian civilians and has a direct negative impact on humanitarian assistance and on the capacity of humanitarian workers to do their job effectively and safely. Israeli security measures are made necessary by that ongoing terrorist activity, and the humanitarian situation cannot be properly considered without an appreciation of the context that has compelled Israel to adopt those defensive measures. We also believe that the issue of humanitarian assistance is one that should be devoid of selectivity and politicization.</div>
	<div class="p">Israel's decision to join the consensus on this resolution is a reflection of its support for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. It should not be construed as implying an endorsement of certain terms that appear in the text that are not consistent with the language used in the agreements between the parties or their spirit. We would also stress the need to acknowledge the fact that civilians on both sides, Israeli and Palestinian, are suffering, and the importance of working to ensure that both sides live in security and dignity, free from violence and fear.</div>
	<div class="p">Ultimately, the well-being of both Palestinian and Israeli civilians will come from the mutual implementation of obligations, from mutual recognition and from mutual compromise in accordance with the road map process. As recognized by many States over the past few days in this Hall, there is now a window of opportunity in the Middle East. We are hopeful that with responsible leadership, effective institutions and a commitment to end violence and terrorism and promote peaceful coexistence, Israelis and Palestinians can work together to ensure peace and security and bring better living conditions to both our peoples.</div>

	<div class="p">I have the honour, on behalf of the Governments of Finland and the United Republic of Tanzania, as the main sponsors, to introduce to the General Assembly draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A/59/L.38">A/59/L.38</a>, entitled "<i>A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All</i>; report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization". Since the publication of the draft resolution, the following countries have joined the list of sponsors: Algeria, Brazil, Croatia, the Gambia, Iceland, Lebanon, Madagascar, Malta, Monaco, Nepal, Norway, Peru, Romania, Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Uruguay, Zambia and the countries of the European Union. We wish to thank all countries for their support.</div>
	<div class="p">The World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization was co-chaired by the President of Finland, Her Excellency Tarja Halonen, and the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, His Excellency Benjamin William Mkapa, and facilitated by the International Labour Organization. It may be recalled that the report was launched by the two Presidents here at the United Nations on 20 September 2004. The Governments of Finland and the United Republic of Tanzania and the other sponsors decided to table this draft resolution in order to ensure that the proposals and recommendations contained in the report of the World Commission will enjoy continued discussion and implementation in United Nations organs and bodies, the United Nations system of organizations, Member States and the international community as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p">The preambular paragraphs of the draft resolution recall and reaffirm the commitment in the Millennium Declaration to ensure that globalization benefits the entire world, and that there is greater policy coherence and better cooperation between the United Nations, its agencies, the Bretton Woods institutions and other multilateral bodies. The preambular paragraphs further recognize the contribution of the implementation of the commitments agreed in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the eradication of poverty, achieving sustained economic growth and promoting sustainable development, as well as in advancing towards a fully inclusive and equitable globalization.</div>
	<div class="p">In the operative paragraphs, the draft resolution takes note of the World Commission's report as a contribution towards achieving an inclusive and equitable process of globalization. Essentially, it decides to consider the report within the framework of the follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit and the integrated and coordinated follow-up to the major United Nations conferences and summits in economic and social fields.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the draft resolution calls on all United Nations organs and bodies, organizations of the United Nations system and all Member States to consider the report of the World Commission. It invites the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant multilateral bodies to provide information to the Secretary-General on their activities to promote an inclusive and equitable globalization in line with the Millennium Declaration.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, the draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to take the report of the World Commission into account in his comprehensive report for the 2005 review of the Millennium Summit and to present it at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Once again, on behalf of the Governments of Finland and the United Republic of Tanzania, and on my own behalf, we wish to express our sincere and heartfelt gratitude to all delegations that participated constructively in the process of negotiation. Their cooperation and forward-looking attitudes have made it possible for this draft resolution to be tabled before this body.</div>
