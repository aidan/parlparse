	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa05">"The Security Council stresses that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Croatia and welcomes the holding of talks between the parties in Geneva earlier today. It calls on both parties to commit themselves fully to that process and to acceptance of the Draft Agreement drawn up by the Co-Chairman as a basis for continuing those talks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">"The Security Council demands that the parties halt all military actions and exercise the utmost restraint."</p>
