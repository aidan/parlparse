	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1997-319.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/319</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 18 April 1997 from the Permanent Representative of the United Republic of Tanzania to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting a copy of the official communiqué of the Fourth Arusha Summit meeting on the Burundi conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council is concerned that, despite recent positive developments, there is continuing instability in Burundi. It recalls its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1072(1996).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1072 (1996)</a> of 30 August 1996, in which, <i>inter alia, </i>it demanded that all sides ln Burundi declare a unilateral cessation of hostilities and initiate unconditional negotiations with a view to reaching a comprehensive political settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its support for the efforts of the regional leaders and takes note of the Joint Communiqué (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-319.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/319</a>) of 16 April 1997 issued following the Fourth Arusha Regional Summit on the Burundi Conflict held in Arusha, Tanzania. In particular, the Council welcomes the decision of the regional leaders to ease sanctions in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the fact that talks are being held in Rome which are complementary to the Arusha process. It also welcomes the commitment of the Government of Burundi to the comprehensive political dialogue among all the parties within the framework of the Arusha process. It urges all the parties in Burundi to continue to pursue a negotiated settlement and to refrain from actions which are detrimental to such dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the involuntary resettlement of rural populations and calls upon the Government of Burundi to allow the people to return to their homes without any hindrance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its support and appreciation to former President Nyerere as well as to the Special Representative of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity in their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to keep the Council informed on the situation in Burundi, especially with regard to the progress of a negotiated and peaceful settlement in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council will remain seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-32.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/32</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
