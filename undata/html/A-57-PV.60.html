<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">The General Assembly, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-38.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 56/38</a> of 5 December 2001 and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-473.pdf" class="nolink">decision 56/473</a> of 27 June 2002, will consider the outcome of the International Year of Volunteers and its follow-up, under agenda item 98.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">Today the General Assembly will engage in a discussion on volunteerism and reflect on the International Year of Volunteers. Volunteerism has an important place in our society. Local volunteer involvement is an invaluable and indispensable contribution to the betterment of social conditions, the promotion of economic development and empowering people to take charge. It spans a broad array of areas, ranging from supporting democratization and peace-building initiatives, electoral assistance, verifying human rights, humanitarian age education, gender-mainstreaming, health care and sustaining the environment, to name just a few.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Volunteerism reinforces a sense of collective responsibility, makes a tangible difference in the lives of many and brings self-fulfilment to the individual volunteer. The potential of volunteerism to contribute significantly to the attainment of the Millennium Goals cannot be overestimated.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">The International Year of Volunteers was a milestone in recognizing the tireless work of volunteers around the world. It generated and mobilized public awareness. It helped to connect volunteers of various parts of the world, and, most important, it created a motivating environment conducive to volunteer action. Clearly, many more Governments now see volunteerism as a valuable asset that needs to be strategically factored into development policies and programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">The International Year of Volunteers was launched with a view to achieving four main objectives: recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteering. Accomplishments in all of those areas have been remarkable. The recognition of volunteerism was advanced by a number of research studies that were conducted globally and nationally through international support and cooperation. The role and the contribution of volunteerism in human development have been recognized by the highest authorities in most countries. Several concrete actions have been taken by them to incorporate those factors into their development strategies. The United Nations Volunteers programme, which was established more than 30 years ago, and its Volunteers have set a noble example through their services in various capacities around the world. The United Nations system, with its specialized agencies and programmes, is committed to increased involvement to promote volunteerism.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">A very important achievement of the International Year of Volunteers was the facilitation of volunteering through a number of measures. One of the principal areas was the enactment of new legislation or the strengthening of existing legislation, which will make volunteer action in many countries far easier. Also important in that respect were consultations on policy options and the creation of new volunteer support mechanisms and infrastructure, such as volunteer centres, volunteer corps, national commissions as advisory bodies and national forums.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa07">Another achievement of the International Year of Volunteers was the involvement of non-traditional actors, such as the private sector. In addition, it engaged persons who might otherwise be associated with receiving volunteer help, such as older persons, persons with disabilities, persons living with HIV/AIDS and refugees. Their involvement and empowerment are of special significance.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa08">The International Year of Volunteers also helped to build networks of volunteers, thereby giving volunteers in individual countries a sense of inter-connective support and mutuality. It provided opportunities for a number of meetings, organizing workshops and training courses to share and exchange information and best practices.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa09">The media, including radio stations, television programmes and newspapers, were harnessed in the promotion of volunteerism. Promotional events and tools, such as booklets, posters and commemorative postage stamps were employed.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa10">The International Year of Volunteers has put volunteering on a more solid basis for the years to come. But a great deal still needs to be done if volunteerism is to fulfil its potential. <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-38.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 56/38</a> of last year provided some invaluable pointers in that respect. Governments should continue to support and develop the volunteerism infrastructure and technical cooperation. International organizations, civil society and the private sector should also continue to support the volunteer movement. The unique relationship between volunteerism and the United Nations should be reinforced and developed.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa11">The International Year of Volunteers played its role superbly. It invigorated and energized the movement of volunteer action. In closing, let me pay tribute to all those who made that success possible. Special recognition goes to the United Nations Volunteers, who acted as a focal point for the International Year of Volunteers, and to the many civil society volunteer-involving organizations that played a vital role in ensuring that the Year had a global outreach. Recognition must also go to many Governments of the North and the South that contributed to many of the specific activities and events. But, above all, the utmost recognition and homage go to the millions of dedicated women and men around the globe who are acting out their sense of citizenship through voluntary action. Your cause is noble and your endeavours are invaluable in our common effort to bring about a better world. I wish you much success.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa12">I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-57-L.8.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/L.8</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Egydio Villela</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">On behalf of the 142 countries listed in <a href="../pdf/A-57-L.8-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/L.8/Add.1</a> and the delegations of Azerbaijan, Belize, Bulgaria, the Comoros, Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Lesotho, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, the Republic of Moldova, Samoa, Slovakia, Slovenia, Tajikistan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam and Yemen, which have joined the original group of sponsors, I have the honour to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-57-L.8-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/L.8/Add.1</a>, entitled "Follow-up to the International Year of Volunteers".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">That resolution recognizes the valuable contribution of the various forms of volunteering to economic and social development. It sees volunteerism as a powerful tool in overcoming social exclusion and discrimination, benefiting society at large, communities and the individual volunteer. It also recognizes that volunteerism -- particularly at the community level -- will help to achieve the Millennium Development Goals as well as the objectives set out at other major United Nations conferences and summits. It takes stock of the widely positive results of the International Year of Volunteers and of the extensive network of committees established at all levels, with the broad participation of the different sectors of society. It welcomes the various developments of policies, the enactment of legislation for the growth and development of volunteerism and the crucial role of the United Nations Volunteers in the preparation and implementation of the Year.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">This draft resolution also provides guidance for our future actions. In the follow-up to the International Year, Governments and the Secretariat are called upon to observe and to promote 5 December as the International Volunteer Day for Economic and Social Development. United Nations Volunteers is invited to enhance network capabilities as well as to expand information, knowledge and resource management through a global Internet volunteer resource. All stakeholders, particularly the private sector through corporate volunteering, are encouraged to continue to support voluntary activities and relevant organizations of the United Nations system are called upon to integrate volunteerism in its various forms into their policies, programmes and reports.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">It is our hope that this draft resolution, which has already drawn wide support from member countries, will be adopted by consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa05">The mere fact that we are gathered here today is a demonstration of the success of our endeavour. Now, by turning our attention to the continuation of this success, we may be able in the long run to make the dream of a better world become a reality thanks to volunteerism. It is this dream that I would like to share with all representatives -- the dream of engaging every human being in voluntary action aimed at the diligent and essential challenge of building a better world. Volunteerism allows for the empowerment of all persons. It furthers the participation of the individual in our common destiny.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa06">To promote volunteer work is to enable all human beings to make the most of their lives. Volunteer work enriches the volunteer and transforms him or her into a better person. Better persons are needed for a better world. Volunteering also enhances the self-esteem of participants at both ends of the spectrum -- at the giving and the receiving ends. It fosters tolerance, solidarity and trust. These are certainly building blocks for peace, for justice, for equality and for sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa07">The word volunteer comes from the Latin "<i>voluntas</i>", which means will, human will or free will. We must all be reminded of the true power and value of the human will. It was through the inspiration of the free will of our people that this Organization was created over the rubble of authoritarianism, conflict and discrimination. Only the force of the human will shall make the world a better place.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa08">In recent years, Brazil has seen a growing involvement of civil society. Research indicates that one out of every four Brazilians has dedicated some of his or her time and talent to volunteer activities. The figures on corporate social investment reveal an impressive increase over the past year. One study shows that two thirds of Brazilian companies sponsor some kind of social activity. As a result of the activities organized in the context of the International Year of Volunteers in 2001, there is a growing recognition in Brazil of the impact of civic participation and of the benefits of volunteering. Let me mention but a few of these activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa09">First, thousands of secondary-level students all over the country have embraced volunteerism and are busy planning and executing projects that contribute to their education as well as to the increased integration of communities and schools. Secondly, high schools are promoting volunteer work as a highly desirable extracurricular activity. Schools are signalling to society that volunteering is a critical ingredient of education by acknowledging students volunteering work in report cards. Thirdly, businesses view favourably young adults who have records of social participation as students. Entrepreneurs are hiring job-seekers who have offered some of their free time and energy to the betterment of society. Fourthly, business managers are discovering that volunteer activities can boost team performance, with positive results in productivity terms and in the workplace atmosphere. Fifthly, volunteer work has moved away from the realm of charity, where it involved mostly persons who were not employed. It is now in the arena of entrepreneurship, where workers and non-workers engage freely in improving their communities. Today, volunteering is for everyone -- women, children, adolescents, older persons and persons with disabilities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa10">Civil society in Brazil, through volunteer work, has placed itself at the heart of generating social capital and sustainable development awareness. Solidarity enhances the moral texture of our communities and the social fabric of our societies. In Brazil, we have come a little closer to making true our dream of empowering every human being, but much more remains to be done and much more will be done.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motomura</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">On  behalf  of  the Government of Japan, I should like to thank you, Sir, and the other members of the Bureau for assuming your important offices, and the representatives of the United Nations Volunteers for so successfully completing the preparations for this important meeting. My delegation pledges its cooperation to you as you preside over this meeting of the General Assembly devoted to the outcome and follow-up of the International Year of Volunteers.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">Since its establishment in 1971, the United Nations Volunteers has engaged in missions all around the world in response to requests from the international community to support development, provide humanitarian assistance or ensure fair elections. It has strengthened volunteer activities in a variety of ways and played a remarkable role in mobilizing grass roots participation in international cooperation on a global scale in areas where only the United Nations can act effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Last year, the United Nations and the international community celebrated the Year of Volunteers with great success. It remains necessary, however, for the people of the world to continue these activities in the years to come, based on the spirit of volunteerism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">Let me take this opportunity to ask a question. Why is volunteerism necessary? There are as many answers as there are places in the world. But volunteerism has its roots in the simple fact that people do not live in isolation. Throughout our lives, we are constantly in search of a better life. We strive to improve our situation in life and to enhance our well-being and our material environment. But is this the only way for us to live? I think not. Each of us has a heart, and we care about people who are in pain, and who are suffering. In other words, we are born to help each other. It is therefore necessary for us to carry this concept of volunteerism further forward. We can start with the smallest of communities around us and then expand the sphere of our volunteerism by sharing with others the pleasures and difficulties we have encountered and the lessons we have learned.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">It is obvious that the United Nations, as the only universal institution in the world, can play a significant role in enhancing volunteerism. It is quite heartening for us that the international community has made considerable progress in this field since the celebration of the International Year of Volunteers in December last year. The exchange of information and experience has been helpful, and the recent enrichment of the International Year of Volunteers web site is proof of the strides we are making.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">I would like briefly to touch upon the increase in volunteerism in Japan in recent years. For example, there were approximately 16,000 volunteer organizations and approximately 1.6 million volunteers in Japan in 1980. But by 2001, those numbers increased to approximately 97,000 and 7.2 million respectively.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">In that context, I would like now to draw your attention to what the Government of Japan has been doing to facilitate volunteer activities in the past year. It has, for example, taken a number of measures in the area of public relations, awareness and information-gathering on volunteerism and human resources development. Overall, it has placed the greatest emphasis on the cultivation of volunteers and training courses that have been implemented with a view to developing youth volunteer leaders. In addition to the training courses, the Government of Japan will hold a symposium and workshop on volunteerism in February next year, to which it is inviting eminent volunteer leaders from around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">It is also important to facilitate volunteer activities in civil society institutionally. As the representative of Japan mentioned at the closing ceremony for the International Year of Volunteers last December, my Government has introduced a preferential tax system that is aimed at promoting donations to non-profit organizations. As well, the Government of Japan makes great efforts to publicize the observance of 5 December as International Volunteer Day. And at the initiative of civil society, there will be a variety of activities on that date this year.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa09">Educational institutions are well positioned to make the significance of volunteerism more widely known. In Japan, primary and junior high school students do volunteer activities in their communities as part of their curriculum. And in recent years, more and more working people have begun to engage in volunteer activities. To promote this trend, the Government of Japan has prepared a range of informational materials.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa10">Furthermore, we have a unique system for assisting volunteer activities abroad. The Japanese postal savings system, under the campaign it is carrying out entitled "Postal savings for international voluntary aid", encourages account holders to donate the interest from their accounts. This has provided grant assistance in the amount of approximately $3 million to approximately 140 non-governmental organizations that have engaged in the 150 volunteer projects.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa11">And in the context of international assistance on volunteer activities, the Japan International Cooperation Agency dispatches senior volunteers, who range from 40 to 69 years old, to developing countries in response to the growing number and types of requests for technical cooperation from developing countries. These senior volunteers are individuals who possess abundant knowledge and experience in a wide range of fields and are motivated by a desire to serve on a volunteer basis.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, I would like to thank the United Nations Volunteers for the outstanding work they have done in expanding the volunteer spirit and express our sincere appreciation to Ms. Capeling-Alakija, the Executive Coordinator, and her staff, for their leadership. The people of Japan support volunteers and intend to continue to contribute to the activities of the United Nations Volunteers.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Moesby</span> <span class="nation">Denmark</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern Europe countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovenia -- and the associated countries Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European Free Trade Association country member of the European Economic Area, Norway, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The dedication and enthusiasm that volunteers bring to their work and to projects in which they are involved is one of the best expressions of humanity -- a simple desire to assist someone else without recompense, a basic element of human nature and a core value of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Since the launch of the International Year of Volunteers 2001, significant progress has been made towards enhancing the recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of voluntary action, all of which are important goals of the International Year.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">One key tool used in the pursuit of these goals merits special attention, namely the Internet. Through a significant use of this and other electronic media, volunteers have been able to expand their networks and enhance their exchange of knowledge and information. The Internet has connected the many diverse expressions of voluntary action and demonstrated its capacity as a multiplier of ideas and a means of sharing best practices. The EU welcomes the growth of volunteerism in cyberspace and encourages stakeholders to continue to make use of the opportunities provided by the Internet.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">The challenge before us today is to consolidate the successes of the International Year and to ensure that the momentum created by the Year is harnessed effectively to move the volunteer agenda forward.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">As a result of the International Year, legislation and relevant policies in many countries have been improved to remove possible obstacles to voluntary work and to create opportunities for voluntary actions. Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done in order fully to ensure that every society, and every individual, has the best possible opportunity to benefit from voluntary activities, both as volunteer and as beneficiary. The responsibility for this important task -- to further expand the scope of voluntary activity and to secure its long-term viability -- rests with Governments. The EU is convinced that this can most effectively be done by developing partnerships with civil society and the private sector. Joint action by the public authorities and volunteer associations can help both to achieve their common objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">The member States of the EU have used the impetus of the International Year to remove legal and administrative obstacles to voluntary activity in both the national and international contexts, guided by the strategic objectives formulated by the United Nations within the framework of the International Year. In our ongoing efforts to improve the environment for voluntary activity, we will look closely at the recommendations and information offered by the Secretary-General in his report as well as the recommendations contained in the annex to last year's <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-38.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 56/38</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">Voluntary work promotes social participation and active citizenship, and it strengthens civil society. It can help maintain and improve society's stability and cohesion. Whatever its form, volunteering builds trust and solidarity. It has proved to be a means of reconciliation and reconstruction. When the underprivileged and the prosperous join together in voluntary activities, innovative partnerships can be created and bridges built between all sectors of society.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">Voluntary activities have already made substantial contributions in the fields of promoting human rights and international solidarity, the combat against racism, environmental protection and sustainable development, and have thus helped in the implementation of the goals and commitments of the Millennium Declaration. By encouraging voluntary work, Governments as well as the international community can make significant progress in many areas of global interest and concern. For example, voluntary work is regarded as crucial for achieving internationally agreed development goals, including those set out by international conferences and summits and contained in the Millennium Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">This was recently confirmed in Johannesburg, where voluntary contributions were explicitly highlighted in several areas, including disaster management, the importance of ensuring safe drinking water, and environmental and social responsibility and accountability. Furthermore, the voluntary involvement of people in the projects and programmes affecting them directly -- a step towards people-centred development -- is a key factor for successful outcomes.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">Yet, when drawing on voluntary work, Governments must recognize and respect the independent nature of such contributions. They can be of significant economic value for national economies. But the responsibility taken or the economic value of voluntary activity can never, and should never, replace the responsibility of Governments towards their citizens.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">It is a recognized fact that volunteers gain a great personal reward from becoming involved in voluntary activities, in terms of both practical knowledge and the development of personal and occupational skills which can be drawn on in other aspects of life. An individual's engagement in this type of human and social activity enhances self-esteem and widens social, economic and cultural networks around the world. It is thus of utmost importance to promote a society in which all persons can involve themselves in voluntary activities, regardless of social, economic or cultural background.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa13">The EU reiterates the particular importance of the voluntary involvement of young people and of older persons. Voluntary work can help develop creativity and a spirit of enterprise in young people. It also makes for social innovation. The Second World Assembly on Ageing, held in Madrid in April this year, recognized volunteering on the part of older persons as essential for the full implementation of the Plan of Action adopted by the Assembly. When combined, these two groups of volunteers allow for intergenerational transfer and the development of knowledge, experience and innovation, to the benefit of society and of the volunteers themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa14">The European Union takes this opportunity to draw Member States' attention to the draft resolution on the follow-up to the International Year of Volunteers, which was submitted today by Brazil.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa15">We also wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the United Nations Volunteers programme and its role as central coordinator for volunteers and voluntary work.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa16">We hope that all stakeholders will use today's debate and the celebration of International Volunteers Day on 5 December to demonstrate their true commitment to further raising the profile of volunteering, to make volunteerism prosper, and to allow international society to gain from this example of humanity.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Atta</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The International Year of Volunteers is an extremely important concept in the context of our modern world, where pressures are increasing daily because of the limited potential of Governments to deal with the unlimited needs of peoples -- hence the importance of civic action to bridge this gap through organized collective efforts that are based on the reorientation of resources towards sectors and areas that need them most.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Egypt attaches great importance to civic action and to the work being done by non-governmental organization (NGOs) and international organizations, as well as to the efforts being made by Governments and by the private sector. Egypt was among the first countries to set up a Committee for the International Year of Volunteers; it did so to reaffirm the principles and objectives set out by the General Assembly in its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-17.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 52/17</a>, which proclaimed 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers. Egypt therefore set up that Committee, which included in its membership representatives of all parties relevant to volunteer work, such as the Government sector and the private and civic sectors. Preparations were thus coordinated for the Year and for creating a mechanism for managing voluntary efforts in subsequent years.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">Egypt celebrated the International Year of Volunteers in a practical way, focusing on certain aspects, one of which is information. Emphasis was placed on the informational aspect of voluntary activities in various fields, in order to serve society and enhance volunteerism, in particular among young people. Television and radio debates and interviews have been held with volunteers to discuss their various projects and activities. A number of debates were also organized and televised on the role of volunteers in society. In that way their needs were assessed so as to enable their various problems to be resolved. In that context, a commemorative stamp was issued on the occasion of the International Year of Volunteers. Secondly, the Egyptian Ministry of Youth organized numerous contests which were carried out by the general union of scouts and counsellors, including the national project devoted to developing Egyptian villages. Such projects had double benefits: developing and modernizing many villages and improving living conditions in them and strengthening the spirit of belonging and participation among the young. In this context, I should like to refer to the international conference to help those with special needs that was organized in August 2001 by the general union of scouts. A guide, the first of its kind, has been drawn up for volunteer organizations in Egypt and other Arab countries. A register of volunteer pioneers in Egypt has been set up, which emphasizes the work of such pioneers so as to set an example for young people. A training camp for volunteers and various governmental stakeholders has also been established.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">The Government is making use of volunteers in various official delegations -- some of them attending the international meetings that took place in the framework of the Year. Civil society is also involved, and the business sector has stepped up its efforts in this respect. These efforts have been physical as well as material. This demonstrates the interest that Egypt and its people attach to this Year, and we have joined the sponsors of this draft resolution before the General Assembly on the follow-up of the Year. I would like to reaffirm the importance of continuing the efforts undertaken in the context of volunteerism, at both the national and international levels, at the end of the International Year of Volunteers, with a view to sustaining the idea that in turn encourages young people to continue their efforts to serve their country and society.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nguyen Thanh Chau</span> <span class="nation">Viet Nam</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">It has been seven years since the Copenhagen Summit on Social Development firmly placed the question of social development at the centre of the international policy debate. The Copenhagen Declaration laid out the fundamental concepts, principles and goals of social development and agreed upon a number of commitments. Together with the Declaration, the Programme of Action addressed the creation of a favourable environment for social development and focused on the three core issues of poverty eradication, employment generation and social integration.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The eradication of poverty -- the uncompleted task of the twentieth century, and now one of the principal objectives for the twenty-first century -- was emphasized at the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly entitled "World Summit for Social Development and beyond: achieving social development for all in a globalizing world".</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">In the Millennium Declaration, a clear target was set to halve extreme poverty by 2015, thus reaffirming the vital importance of fighting poverty for the process of social development of all societies, particularly in the developing countries. Along the same lines, the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty also called for the launching of a global campaign to this end.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">One important element in ensuring concrete progress towards the realization of the established goals is that both national Governments and the international community should undertake concerted efforts in a mutually supportive manner. It is well known that many Governments throughout the developing world have been trying in earnest to fight against poverty at the national level, and they have achieved quite encouraging results. In Viet Nam, for example, within the last 10 years the poverty rate has been reduced from 30 per cent to 10 per cent. At present, there are still more than 1,000 villages listed as being in extreme poverty, but such poverty will be wiped out by 2015, as solemnly pledged by our Government.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">At the international level, the United Nations system and its agencies, funds and programmes have been actively responsive with regard to this special responsibility, and their important contributions have been widely recognized. However, in assisting national Governments to devise and implement effectively their respective programmes on poverty eradication, sufficient international cooperation, including experience-sharing, the extension and expansion of technical cooperation, capacity-building and the active engagement and support of the relevant agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system are of the utmost importance and need to be emphasized.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Another important issue on our agenda is people with disabilities. According to statistics provided by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, there are around 600 million disabled persons in the world, more than two thirds of whom are living in the Asia and Pacific region. Furthermore, according to World Bank statistics, disabled persons account for one fifth of the poorest people in the world. The increasing number of disabled persons can be attributed to social problems, environmental deterioration, disease, natural and man-made disasters, and war and armed conflict in many parts of the world. The question of social integration, ensuring their equal rights and providing them with opportunities, is therefore of crucial importance for many countries throughout the world. We welcome the establishment and operationalization of the Ad Hoc Committee on a Comprehensive and Integral International Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities, which will fully address the rights and dignity of such people. We wish the Ad Hoc Committee great success in its endeavours.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">After decades of severe war, Viet Nam has a high percentage of people with disabilities. There are more than 5 million disabled persons of all ages in the country with varied disabilities -- 3 million of whom are war victims, accounting for 6 per cent of the population. Responding to the international call reflected in the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, 1983-1992, and the World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons: towards a society for all in the twenty-first century, and in keeping with its longstanding tradition of looking after the unfortunate, the Government and the people of Viet Nam truly care for vulnerable persons, among them the disabled. For such people, this is a question not only of implementing specific policies, but also of achieving genuine integration. The Government has therefore been advocating a close linkage between economic and social development, as well as social progress reflected in special care and the creation of equal opportunities for vulnerable persons and persons with disability.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">In recent years, Viet Nam has achieved tremendous success in taking care of and ensuring protection for disabled persons through, inter alia, the provision of social subsidies, rehabilitation centres, national training programmes, employment-creation schemes and poverty eradication projects. In its effort, Vietnam enjoys precious cooperation and assistance from the international community, especially from United Nations specialized agencies and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">One question of particular concern to our Government at the moment is that of taking care of people, particularly child victims of toxic chemicals such as Agent Orange, which were employed during the war. Their plight is so miserable that they cannot wait until research on this issue is finalized. The Government has allotted subsidies from the State budget to help them. A drive for charitable assistance has been launched throughout the country and has received good response. A number of countries and non-governmental organizations have delivered great assistance in this regard. However, more attention and further assistance are needed, and it is our hope against hope that the United Nations, within its appropriate possible means, will take the question under serious consideration and encourage the international community to cooperate and assist Viet Nam in this humanitarian endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">Viet Nam warmly welcomes the report of the Secretary-General entitled "International Year of Volunteers: outcomes and future perspectives". The report provides us with comprehensive information on what the world community has achieved in the International Year of Volunteers 2001 and envisions what is needed in terms of follow-up activities. The Year was successful by any account, with the high profile recognition of the role of volunteerism in development and of its valuable contributions to society, together with the conviction that voluntary action was needed more than ever before. The goals of the Year -- enhancing the recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteerism -- have been fully achieved with the generation of increased awareness of the achievements and further potential of voluntary activities, with the establishment of more than 100 national committees on volunteers in every part of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">Though the concept of volunteerism is quite new, Viet Nam was quick to respond with the establishment of a National Steering Committee on Volunteers. During the year, this committee focused on many activities, such as the organization of writing competitions on volunteer experiences in community life and national development and the publication of booklets on volunteers in Viet Nam, in order to disseminate information on the International Year of Volunteers. Students and youth were encouraged to go to remote and disadvantaged areas to help, or to assist with, children in especially difficult circumstances, such as homeless and street children and child victims of Agent Orange. These activities have been recognized by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, volunteerism has both social and cultural perspectives. According to some accounts, every volunteer is an actual roving ambassador as he or she contributes to fostering further understanding among peoples. By working together they contribute towards building solidarity, encourage participation and ownership, create networks of reciprocity and reinforce a sense of collective responsibility. It is at the core of the United Nations development goals and, therefore, serves the interests of social development.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar), Vice-President, took the Chair.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bridgeland</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I am pleased to represent the United States of America in my remarks before the United Nations General Assembly in support of volunteer service in the United States and around the globe.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">I would like to thank the Points of Light Foundation and the Association of Junior Leagues International for convening and leading the United States International Year of Volunteers Steering Committee. Their organizations have provided sustained leadership to bring volunteers together to meet important community needs throughout the United States and overseas.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">It is my pleasure and privilege to speak to you today as a member of President George W. Bush's administration, as Assistant to the President and Director of his USA Freedom Corps. Each January, the President of the United States addresses the United States Congress to report to them and to the American people on the state of the union. It is traditional for the President to present the members of Congress and the American people his vision for how to make that union stronger.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">In January 2002, President George W. Bush laid out a vision for a stronger union that was rooted firmly in the power of volunteer service to meet vital needs and to safeguard the principles of freedom. He issued a call to service to every man, woman and child in the United States to dedicate at least two years over the course of their lifetimes to service to America's communities, to America and to the world. He created the USA Freedom Corps, the effort I now direct, to help every American answer that call to service and to foster a culture of service, citizenship and responsibility for decades to come.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">The USA Freedom Corps is a coordinating council chaired by President Bush that oversees the development of Government policies that promote, enhance and support volunteer service. Among our top priorities is reforming and expanding federally supported service programmes. President Bush has pledged to double the number of Peace Corps volunteers, so that by 2007, approximately 15,000 Americans will be sharing American compassion abroad. He has also challenged the Peace Corps to reach more countries around the world and to expand its services to include important global needs, such as quality housing, through partnerships with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">He has also pledged to reform and strengthen domestic programmes that support service by using senior Americans and young Americans to recruit, train and supervise volunteers around the country through our Corporation for National and Community Service. And he created new programmes that enable individuals to help their communities prevent, prepare for, and respond to emergencies of all kinds, including threats of terrorism. Through these new federally-supported programmes, Americans are volunteering with police and fire departments; doctors and nurses are joining in a Medical Reserve Corps; and individuals are being trained to teach emergency response skills to their neighbours. These Citizen Corps volunteers will support their police officers and firefighters in times of earthquake, fire and flood, and in response to crime and terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">The USA Freedom Corps is also working with community-serving organizations, such as hospitals, schools, houses of worship and other non-profit organizations that make up our volunteer infrastructure, to help them recruit, train and utilize millions of volunteers across the United States to deliver vital community services. We are helping them to evaluate and to improve their capacity to effectively utilize the talents of volunteers. By supporting research, developing and disseminating best practices and creating other resources that can be used by organizations around the country, the USA Freedom Corps will cultivate lasting changes in the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">With the help of organizations, including the Points of Light Foundation, we have already created the USA Freedom Corps Volunteer Network, the largest on-line clearinghouse of volunteer service opportunities ever established. Individuals can enter their postal code and their area of interest, such as serving youth, hunger and homelessness, or education, to find part-time or full-time service opportunities with more than 60,000 service organizations, working in their hometowns, across the country, and in countries around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">Our partnerships also extend to businesses and educational institutions. With their help, we are working to create changes in human behaviour that will last for decades. Leaders of American businesses have responded to President Bush's call to service by creating the Business Strengthening America initiative, to engage their employees and consumers in serving others. Member companies commit to changes in corporate practices, such as offering paid leave to their employees for volunteer service, sponsoring employee volunteer efforts and enlisting consumers in volunteer service though their products and services.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">The USA Freedom Corps is also working with the hundreds of thousands of elementary and secondary schools and colleges and universities around our country to help our young people develop habits of service that will last for a lifetime. Schools can support service by making it a part of academic lessons or by sponsoring service activities and volunteer centres as part of the support structure for students. The United States Department of Education and private research organizations have measured increases in volunteer service by young people, and particularly in school-assisted volunteer service, over the past several decades. Researchers are now looking to uncover how those who volunteer as young people behave as adults. The initial research is very promising for those who advocate investing in service opportunities for students and young people. In a recent sample, two thirds of all adults who reported volunteering in the past year reported that they had also volunteered as young people. Those same individuals were also significantly more likely to be engaged in philanthropic giving to non-profit organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">Volunteer service also offers American educators a vital opportunity to teach students about the democratic institutions and fundamental principles that are the foundations of the United States. While the office I direct is less than one year old, its mission is part of the fabric of a long tradition of volunteer service in the United States. Volunteer-based organizations and the efforts of the volunteers who power them have played an important role in meeting the needs of urban and rural communities since our nation was founded. Yet too few of America's students are learning about our rich history and the democratic principles and institutions that safeguard their freedoms. Through service to others we seek to help them connect their service to communities today with the ideas and actions of the past that have helped to shape our national identity.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa12">We also seek to reverse what has been a decline in overall volunteer service and civic participation in the United States among adults by shaping new generations that are more likely to be involved in meeting our future challenges. According to research on volunteer service and civic participation, fewer and fewer American adults have been volunteering their time and participating in civic activities over the past three decades. To accomplish our mission and to reach President Bush's goals, the USA Freedom Corps must reverse that trend.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa13">To measure the effectiveness of our efforts, the USA Freedom Corps has partnered with the United States Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labour Statistics to create a new national volunteer service indicator to measure volunteer behaviour from a nationwide sample of more than 60,000 diverse American households. The nationwide survey will create a reliable and comprehensive measurement of volunteer behaviour that will help the USA Freedom Corps and others engaged in supporting volunteer service to evaluate their impact. To date, sample sizes for evaluating volunteer service trends have been relatively small, and reliable annual comparisons have been difficult to make. This new volunteer-service indicator will set a new standard for research in this field. We have collaborated with leaders in the United Kingdom and Canada on this effort, and have had productive discussions with many members of the European Union on measuring social capital and fostering civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa14">That new research, and our continuing efforts through the USA Freedom Corps, are a priority of President Bush's Administration, and will continue to be as long as there are human needs to be addressed through kindness and compassion. Each night in communities across the United States and around the world children go to bed hungry or in a home that does not provide adequate shelter. Each morning people awake without clean water to drink. And each day men and women go unprotected from, or untreated for, diseases and disorders that might be prevented, treated or cured. These are needs known in every community, and they are needs that must be addressed not only by Governments but also through the time and the care of volunteers.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa15">The USA Freedom Corps will continue in its efforts to engage every man, woman and child in the United States in service to our neighbours. We hope to learn lessons from the nations represented here about how they are cultivating volunteer service. In addition, through our efforts we might also help other nations looking for ways that their leaders and their Governments can become involved in harnessing the time and talents of their people in volunteer service. We would look forward to sharing what we learn in our efforts to support research and measurement at the national level; to help establish and encourage the adoption of effective practices for using volunteers; and to make volunteer service a part of the structure and function of every school, business and community across this country. We would also welcome the opportunity to be joined by other Government leaders around the world who are willing to make a call to service that resonates across their communities, as it is doing in the United States now.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa16">We can all look to the United Nations Volunteers programme as a model for our own future endeavours. Since 1970, the United Nations Volunteers programme has worked on issues ranging from agriculture to education. Each year, 5,000 United Nations volunteers from 150 countries work to improve communities around the world. They include a young woman using her time to create an online resource library for children with disabilities and their families, a man serving as a drug prevention counsellor and a woman bringing compassion and food to victims of natural disasters. Each one of those United Nations Volunteers is a beacon of hope.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa17">I thank the United Nations for this opportunity to address the Assembly today to discuss the dedication and impact of millions of Americans who are improving our country, and whose compassion extends beyond its boundaries. I also thank the United Nations for its support and commitment to the United Nations Year of Volunteers. The 123 nations that created committees to promote volunteer service are testaments to its success. But there is more to do. I hope this important discussion will be a milestone in a worldwide effort to make a difference in the lives of others through volunteer service. Each of us must continue to ask ourselves what Martin Luther King, Jr., has called life's most persistent and urgent question: What are you doing for others?</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Sulaiti</span> <span class="nation">Qatar</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report entitled "International Year of Volunteers: outcomes and future perspectives" (<a href="../pdf/A-57-352.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/352</a>). The report refers to the work done by volunteers at the national, regional and international levels. It also celebrates recognition of volunteer work and seeks to ensure respect for volunteering, to facilitate their work and to establish a network of volunteers. I would also like to pay tribute to the remarkable role played by United Nations Volunteers in this endeavour. We welcome the wide observance of the International Year of Volunteers at the international level. We welcome as well the efforts of national committees in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The achievement of social and economic development is not based solely on the efforts of Governments, but also on the combination of the efforts of civil society organizations, the private sector and all those millions who participate daily in volunteer acts throughout the world. Volunteerism is part and parcel of the cultural heritage of all peoples of the world despite their diversity. The International Year of Volunteers bears out that fact, and also serves to recognize the importance of volunteer work in development.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Volunteer social work is not alien to our society because our religion, Islam, encourages volunteer work. There are numerous suras in the Qur'an and in the Traditions of the Prophet Muhammad that urge the utilization of one's good health, wealth, time and youth to serve those who need help and to advance society. Islam stipulates that individuals perform volunteer work in the service of society and religion. This will ensure self-fulfilment and social integrations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">We have promoted social volunteerism in many ways by providing assistance to the needy, orphans, students, those seeking marriage, debtors and others. The institutionalization of such volunteer work began in 1974 with the establishment of the first volunteer society for rehabilitating the disabled. Several other societies and institutions intended to utilize and promote people's potential have been established, enabling women in particular to volunteer in the service of society.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">Qatar has made great efforts to implement the objectives of the International Year of Volunteers in response to international appeals and resolutions. Therefore, we wish to inform the General Assembly of what has been achieved at the governmental and civil levels.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">At the governmental level, and recognizing the importance of volunteerism in the area of social development and the important role of volunteers in serving their society, the Supreme Family Council -- the institutional tool for the protection and development of the family -- has, since its inception in 1988, created five special volunteer committees for the affairs of children, women, youth, the elderly and those with special needs. Those committees are made up of national experts of both genders. They work on a volunteer basis to enact legislation and recommend policies and programmes within the area of work of each committee.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">A high-level national committee has also been set up to coordinate action between civil societies and private institutions that work on promoting social work and developing volunteer work so that there can be harmony between them and duplication can be avoided. That committee has established and implemented a comprehensive programme for the International Year of Volunteers to raise awareness about the importance of volunteerism.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">The Qatar Centre for Volunteer Work has recently been established as a civil institution under the supervision of the General Youth Service in Qatar. It is intended to raise volunteer awareness among the young. This Centre will train the youth of both genders to support volunteer programmes and activities, organize training sessions for volunteers and prepare studies and publications devoted to volunteer work.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">At the civil level, and recognizing the importance of the role of the private sector in promoting volunteerism in our society, development charity institutions and the private sector have established an annual prize to demonstrate to volunteers the importance of their giving and of their efforts in enriching and perpetuating volunteer work. Based on that initiative, we have recently honoured children who have performed volunteer work in order to inculcate that attitude in their minds.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">Finally, my delegation supports the draft resolution on the follow-up to the International Year of Volunteers, to continue the momentum that has been initiated during the celebration of this Year. We thank volunteers everywhere in the world for their contribution to creating a better world for all.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martnez</span> <span class="nation">Honduras</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">For reasons that are not worth mentioning, Honduras came late to the commemoration of the International Year of Volunteers. However, Honduras, perhaps more than any other county in the world, can testify to the importance and value of volunteerism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Four years ago, during the disaster caused by hurricane Mitch, which caused thousands of deaths and destroyed many of our bridges, roads and highways -- damage that still has not been fully repaired -- the Honduran people were able to show the spirit of solidarity of our compatriots, who, even in the midst of their own tragedy, came to the aid of those most affected and most in need. Likewise and even more importantly, Honduras can attest to international volunteerism because on that same occasion the international community ran to our assistance. The very lives of the volunteers -- who came with no other interest than to help us exactly when we most needed it, during the greatest disaster of our entire history -- were often in danger. We thank them on behalf of the Government and people of Honduras.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">For that reason, and mindful of the fact that the future of mankind will be better with the assistance in solidarity of volunteers, Honduras, in addition to expressing heartfelt thanks, wishes to propose to the Assembly the creation of a university for volunteerism; a university that would nourish the seeds of volunteerism that have been in all human spirits since the very moment of our birth; a university where young people, adults, business people and possibly even those in government could come to study and develop the full potential of volunteerism. It cannot be a mere coincidence that exactly 1,000 years ago the first university of the world was established -- the University at Bologna -- among whose famous guests were Beckett, Alighieri, Copernicus and Marconi. It was the precursor of all the technology that currently is progressing at an incredible rate in the world today. That is a world that is ready for and in need of a university for the study of volunteerism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Poor as it is, Honduras, with a great deal of gratitude and looking toward the future, offers the international community the basic infrastructure for that project. In our very beautiful land we have lush mountains, sunny beaches and green valleys with the tranquillity and climate necessary for study and concentration for all the new Copernicuses, Alighieris, Becketts and Marconis of world volunteerism. There, in the diversity and beauty of our countryside, they will be able to study and think of the best way to build a better world. I can guarantee that. That university for volunteerism is a humble way of saying, Honduran style, with all one's heart, thank you.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Shamsi</span> <span class="nation">United Arab Emirates</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">On behalf of the United Arab Emirates, I should like to thank you, Mr. President, for your efforts in directing the deliberations of this session. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/A-57-352.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/352</a>) and the valuable information that it contains with regard to this agenda item.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">Despite all the pledges made by heads of State or Government at the international conferences on social development that have been convened over the past decade to enhance the possibilities of social development -- culminating in the collective international commitments undertaken in the Political Declaration of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held at Johannesburg, to strengthen and coordinate economic and social development measures in developing and poor countries -- billions of people still live in deteriorating economic and social conditions and lack the basic requirements of human life. Few of those commitments have been fulfilled, while the majority of them remain unfulfilled, as a result of the huge obstacles and challenges posed by extreme poverty, fatal contagious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, illiteracy, armed conflicts, organized crime and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">The United Arab Emirates, reaffirming its support for all the recommendations and outcomes of international conferences on social development and sustainable development, and convinced that social development depends mainly on political security and stability and the provision of means for economic development, stresses the importance of the following. Concerted and coordinated international efforts must be undertaken through United Nations organs to find viable and lasting solutions to armed conflicts and wars and to settle existing disputes in accordance with the principles of the Charter and international legitimacy. The commitments undertaken at development conferences must be fully and urgently fulfilled, especially those calling for the allocation of 0.7 per cent of the gross domestic product of developed and donor countries as official development assistance to developing countries -- as stressed in the International Conference on Financing for Development at Monterrey -- and for the provision of official development assistance to developing countries without conditions or intervention in their internal affairs. The international community, in particular donor countries and international monetary organizations, should help to integrate developing countries into the global economy by establishing an impartial and non-discriminating multilateral trading system based on international law and universal norms. Developing countries should be provided with scientific materials and modern technologies in order to strengthen their economic and social development. That will require the adoption of effective, comprehensive, fair and lasting solutions to the foreign-debt problems of those countries, including the option to write off such debts.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">Guided by the directives of His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, President of the State, in which he regards the citizens of the United Arab Emirates as the country's true wealth and the primary focus of its development efforts, the Government has adopted a number of development policies aimed at developing the nation's human resources and at raising the standard of living for all its citizens. Those policies have placed the United Arab Emirates among the world's top 50 countries in terms of human development, according to United Nations standards, in 2001. The United Arab Emirates has made remarkable progress in the field of social development by adopting a development strategy based on the following.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">Believing in the importance of education as the first step towards the achievement of social progress, the Government has provided free, high-quality education for all citizens, from the elementary to the university level. The Government has also introduced the latest educational technologies and methods, including the latest developments in the field of information and communications technology, as eradicating illiteracy is one of the Government's main concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">The Government has also conducted campaigns to address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and hepatitis B and other diseases. In addition, we have established a marriage fund that helps citizens to start families without financial burdens, and a comprehensive social security system that provides monthly subsidies to vulnerable groups and specialized centres for the rehabilitation of the disabled.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">In accordance with the spirit of Islam, which calls for care and respect for elderly persons, the Government has established specialized health centres, as well as social and recreational centres for the aged, and it has helped to establish many volunteer and charitable societies that provide humanitarian assistance at the local and international levels.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">The social development policy of the United Arab Emirates has not been exclusive to the country itself; we have worked to promote social development and cultural diversity through bilateral and regional agreements by establishing schools, orphanages and houses of worship in many friendly countries, in addition to providing grants and favourable-term loans to developing countries. We have also hosted numerous conferences and seminars and have participated in many international events related to social development, housing and the environment.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, we hope that our discussions will help to fulfil the principles of the Charter, which emphasize the rights of societies to development. We call upon the Organization to strengthen its efforts to attain world peace and stability and to undertake measures to eradicate poverty and to achieve economic and social development, as envisaged in the Millennium Declaration and as emphasized in the declarations concluded at development conferences, especially the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. McIvor</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">At the outset, New Zealand would like to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report entitled "International Year of Volunteers: outcomes and future perspectives" (<a href="../pdf/A-57-352.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/352</a>), which is a useful overview of what was achieved both during and since the 2001 International Year of Volunteers.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">The Government of New Zealand welcomed the decision to designate 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers. We congratulate all those involved in the International Year of Volunteers, including the various United Nations bodies -- particularly United Nations Volunteers -- Member States, civil society, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, for their efforts, which have contributed to the success of the Year and to the follow-up on its outcomes. New Zealand shares the view of the Secretary-General that the Year has done much to increase understanding of the concept of volunteerism in all its forms throughout the world and the vital contribution it makes to so many societies. There have been many significant developments as a result.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">In reflecting on the follow-up to the Year, we would like to take the opportunity to draw on some of New Zealand's own experiences with volunteering.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">New Zealand has a long-standing tradition of volunteering. Volunteers are vital contributors in diverse areas, including sport and recreation, emergency services, early childhood education, care of children and young people, care of sick people or people with disabilities, Maori community activities, churches, conservation, fisheries protection, international development assistance, women's refuges, culture and heritage, and citizens' advice.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">New Zealand values volunteers as contributors to strong communities and civil society, culture, individual well-being and family and <i>whnau</i> development. One of our aims is to form real and meaningful partnerships with volunteers and voluntary organizations to work towards a common goal of providing the best support and services possible for local communities. The Secretary-General acknowledges in his report that the International Year of Volunteers produced greater acknowledgement of diversity in volunteerism and its contribution to society. One of the debates that emerged in New Zealand as a result of the Year was the question of different cultural perspectives on volunteering. On the one hand, we have the predominant Anglo-European perspective and, on the other, we have perspectives of Maori, the indigenous people of Aotearoa/New Zealand, on how they contribute in a voluntary way. Pacific peoples and ethnic communities also have their different perspectives.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">New Zealand fully agrees that partnerships between Governments and civil society are important for promoting volunteerism. Governments play a crucial role in fostering an environment that encourages volunteers. Like many other countries highlighted in the report, in New Zealand the International Year of Volunteers was organized through partnership between Government and the voluntary sector. A Government-appointed Ministerial Reference Group established for the International Year of Volunteers was comprised of representatives of the community and voluntary sector and was responsible for promotion and coordination of the Year and for providing advice to Government on volunteer issues.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">New Zealand was one of three countries noted in the Secretary-General's report that increased funding to provide longer-term support to the voluntary sector as a result of the Year. Some 2.19 million New Zealand dollars were allocated to strengthen the infrastructure of volunteering organizations over three years. This contributed specifically towards the formation of Volunteering New Zealand; the creation of new voluntary centres, especially in rural and isolated areas; funding for volunteering within Maori, Pacific peoples and ethnic communities; and the expansion of Web-based volunteering resources.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">A Statement of Government Intentions for an Improved Community-Government Relationship was released at the end of the International Year of Volunteers. Signed by the Prime Minister, the Statement is the Government's commitment to building strong and respectful relationships with the community sector. The Government also created a new portfolio in 2001, the Minister Responsible for the Community and Voluntary Sector, again indicating our intention to raise the status of this sector of New Zealand society.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">To foster an environment that encourages volunteers, the New Zealand Government also set up a project at the start of 2001 to consider policy on volunteers and volunteering. This project reviewed and made recommendations on legislation towards volunteering, identified ways in which the Government could enhance the ability of people to volunteer and worked to ensure that governmental policy supported volunteerism and volunteers, including in relation to the fulfilment of cultural obligations by Maori, Pacific peoples and ethnic groups. Work in this area continues.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">Finally, the International Year of Volunteers provided States with the opportunity to examine and promote the role of volunteering at national, regional and international levels. For New Zealand, it has considerably boosted support for and raised the public profile of volunteering. The Government has implemented practical steps to show the community and voluntary sector that it recognizes the vital contribution made by volunteers, both economically and socially. We will continue to work towards the aims and objectives of the International Year of Volunteers in the broader international community.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tesch</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">Like other delegations, Australia warmly welcomes the report of the Secretary-General entitled "International Year of Volunteers 2001: outcomes and future perspectives". Australia was an active and keen participant throughout the International Year of Volunteers, which was a great success in Australia. It is our privilege to provide this General Assembly with information about some of the highlights for us, thereby acknowledging before the international community the extraordinary contributions that are routinely made by ordinary people in our country.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The written statement being circulated contains more details provided by the Department of Family and Community Services in Australia, and I will confine myself to summarizing some of the key elements of that.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">The International Year of Volunteers 2001 provided the impetus for the federal, State and local Governments, as well as communities, business and the media in Australia, to recognize and celebrate the extraordinary contribution volunteers make to Australia and to the Australian way of life. It gave all Australians the opportunity to say "thank you". The Minister for Family and Community Services oversaw Australia's successful programme for the Year at the request of the Prime Minister of Australia, and the Governor General was appointed the national patron of the International Year of Volunteers.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">As in other countries, there is a long tradition of volunteering in Australia. Some 32 per cent of adult Australians volunteer their time and energy to not-for-profit organizations. It is pleasing to note that more Australians are choosing to volunteer. The strongest growth is recorded among people aged under 25 and among 55-64-year olds. It seems that our older volunteers have some more time on their hands after children grow up, and they also have very valuable labour-force skills to contribute.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">Throughout 2000, the federal Department of Family and Community Services conducted extensive consultations with community organizations, business and Government to develop the key objectives for the International Year of Volunteers. These were to recognize and celebrate the outstanding contribution volunteers make to a strong, cohesive Australian society; to have communities, business, the media and Government work together to build a society that encourages and nurtures a culture of volunteering; and to support Australian communities in their engagement in valuable and productive voluntary activities.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">Australian Government initiatives during the Year were divided into three areas: first, funding to the community and voluntary sectors; secondly, the development of key partnerships; and thirdly, a communication strategy. One of the highlights of the International Year of Volunteers in Australia was the overwhelmingly positive response by community groups to the small grants and small-equipment grants programmes. Through these programmes, the Australian Government provided 12.9 million Australian dollars in grants to more than 2,100 organizations to help them recognize, celebrate and support volunteers. Through the small-equipment grants programme, a further 2,800 organizations were able to purchase equipment to make the work of their volunteers easier, safer or more enjoyable.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">The promotion of the International Year of Volunteers was done in partnership with businesses and communities and included sponsorship of a major national conference, as well as International Year of Volunteers awards in partnership with one of Australia's major banks and with local Government; funding to establish a recruitment database for the organization Volunteering Australia; and celebration and acknowledgement nation-wide of volunteers helping to clean up and preserve the environment.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">While the main aim of the International Year of Volunteers communication strategy was to promote the International Year, it also sought to raise awareness, particularly among non-volunteers, of the range, scope and positive experience of volunteering. The Australian Government launched a different celebratory theme each month to provide a framework for organizations planning their International Year of Volunteers activities. Communicating the International Year of Volunteers message was also done in partnership with another major milestone for Australia: the centenary of the establishment of Australia as a Federation. It is noteworthy that many of the achievements within Australia since the establishment of federation in 1901 were the result of the hard work and dedication of volunteers. The Government recognized that through the production of community service announcements broadcast on national television.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">The Australian Government also recognized the invaluable contribution of community groups in Australia during the International Year of Volunteers and the need to consider where we go from here. An International Year of Volunteers Community Council of Advice, co-chaired by Volunteering Australia and Australian Volunteers International, actively gathered input throughout the year for a report entitled "A National Agenda on Volunteering: Beyond the International Year of Volunteers". It was presented to the Government at the final event of the International Year of Volunteers, on 5 December, International Volunteer Day.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">It is encouraging to note that since 2000, ongoing federal Government funding to support volunteering has more than doubled, and research continues on how best to support volunteers. The capacity of the sector is being further developed through programmes which, for example, enhance the development of volunteers' skills. The Australian Government is confident that the activities and events held during the International Year of Volunteers in 2001 have left a strong and lasting impression and provided a solid base to further develop this important sector of Australian community life.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lee Ho-jin</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">My delegation believes that the wide promotion of, and the active participation in, volunteerism is most relevant to the work of the United Nations in achieving the objectives enshrined in its Charter. Thus, taking stock of the accomplishments of the International Year of Volunteers, I would like to applaud the advances made for volunteerism, as contained in the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/A-57-352.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/352</a>) and commend the efforts of the United Nations Volunteers for its facilitating role.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">The spirit of volunteerism that was promoted worldwide in 2001 has made a positive contribution to the lives of the Korean people, and the effect is likely to take a firm hold in the coming years. Traditionally, Koreans have lived in agricultural communities, with longstanding customs in volunteer service and sharing, particularly during the labour-intensive farming season and in moments of hardship or tragedy. The tradition has gradually dissipated during the process of rapid modernization and industrialization. But with the growth of civic activism in recent decades, volunteerism has found fertile ground for a new era of possibilities and contributions to be made at the local, national and global levels.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">Many other countries will have had the same experience. However, as we agreed in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-38.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 56/38</a>, there is no universal model of best practices or measures in volunteering. Volunteer activities are most effective when fully responsive to the particular circumstances on the ground. The one common denominator would be that they are voluntary, unpaid and helpful.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Another commonality, as can be seen in the Secretary General's report, is that there are diverse ways in which volunteerism in being promoted around the world to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century: the enhanced recognition of volunteerism through research and by institutions and organizations; the facilitation through policy and legislation, infrastructure development, funding and private sector support and the participation of all social groups; networking among volunteer groups; promotion through mass media and campaigns; and utilization of information and communication technologies. All five of those means of promotion offer a useful blueprint for efforts to incorporate and strengthen volunteerism as capital for social and economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Volunteer activities are the purview of civic groups and the private sector. But Governments can play a facilitating, supportive role. In my country, the Government operates a system of support for volunteer activities, including through the provision of public facilities to voluntary service organizations, project-based subsidies and the improvement of the relevant laws. The Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs provides subsidies to non-governmental organizations engaged in volunteering programmes. Since 2000, $12.5 million has been disbursed annually by the Ministry in support of volunteer activities undertaken by civic groups. In addition, other ministries and local governments frequently have their own programme of support for registered non-governmental organizations. In 2000, the relevant Ministry and local governments jointly formed local volunteering centres around the country, where the recruiting and training of volunteers takes place, along with the publication and distribution of manuals. Furthermore, to make the most of the 2001 International Year of Volunteers, the Korean National International Year of Volunteers Committee was formed to coordinate all the events and programmes of the year.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">The year 2002 was very busy for volunteers in Korea, with both good and bad times, and the experience has greatly strengthened the nation's capacity in volunteerism. On the happy side, 2002 will be remembered as the year when Korea successfully co-hosted the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. In each city around the country where the matches were played, soccer officials recruited anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 volunteers and trained them to assist in running the games and providing whatever assistance soccer fans and tourists would require to enjoy the games and their stay in the country. No doubt, much of the credit for the good order surrounding the largest international sports gathering to be held in the country has to go to those selfless volunteers.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">The spirit of volunteerism rose in hard times too, when a devastating typhoon hit the eastern part of the country in late August. Roads leading into the worst-hit areas were lined up with cars and buses, taking volunteers into those communities to help out in the relief and recovery effort. Many of them were small groups of people: housewives, family clans and company co-workers who had spontaneously grouped under a shared sense of duty to help people in need.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">The Asian Games, held from 29 September to 14 October in Busan, South Korea, were another proud episode in the annals of volunteerism in Korea this year. The careful recruiting and training of some 17,300 volunteers by the host city, Busan, was instrumental in the success of the Games.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, much has been done in my country this year to implement <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-38.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 56/38</a>, and with good results. Now, as we prepare to celebrate an International Volunteer Day for Economic and Social Development on 5 December, my delegation looks to the future and contemplates two closely related subjects. First, as in all realms of human activity in this age of diminishing borders, while keeping its feet firmly grounded in action at the local grass-roots level, volunteerism should now be promoted and strengthened in the context of the globalizing world. Secondly, the possibilities offered by information and communication technologies should be fully embraced to support the traditional on-the-scene approach of volunteerism. Following those two basic directions, and building upon the momentum generated by the International Year of Volunteers, my delegation is fully committed to taking volunteerism to new heights at home and abroad.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nambiar</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">India is happy to participate in the deliberations on the outcome of the International Year of Volunteers and its follow-up. The General Assembly decided at the fifty-second session, in 1997, to observe 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers. This was in recognition of the need to celebrate the manifold contributions made to society by volunteers and volunteering. The international community had clearly concluded that not enough had been done to highlight the achievements of volunteerism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">Volunteerism has been one of the few success stories of society globally. In that connection, the report of the Secretary-General entitled "International Year of Volunteers: outcome and future perspectives" (<a href="../pdf/A-57-352.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/352</a>) presents a gratifying, and indeed heartening, picture. According to the report, 123 National Committees were formed during the Year. Having existed in many societies in different forms for generations, volunteerism appears to have come of age. The principal aim of the International Year of Volunteers -- to instil lasting improvements to voluntary actions -- was, therefore, a key and significant objective.</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline-tookchair" id="pg018-bk02">

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nambiar</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk03-pa01">The observance of the International Year of Volunteers has succeeded in providing a welcome impetus to volunteerism. This has been done through the institution of awards and special studies programmes in schools and institutions; publication of books, manuals and surveys; undertaking of research; and enactment and improvement of legislation relating to volunteerism. The association and patronage of volunteerism by a large number of dignitaries and eminent personalities has also provided a significant boost to the achievement of objectives and the realization of targets of the International Year of Volunteers. This has all contributed to making the International Year of Volunteers a remarkably memorable one.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk03-pa02">We agree with the assertion in the Secretary-General's report that a major outcome of the Year has been the collective recognition by Governments of the role and contribution of voluntary action and of the need to adopt strategic approaches to enhancing the environment for such actions to flourish. We consider volunteerism to be one of the important tools for addressing the problem of exclusion. Volunteerism provides a vehicle for empowering population groups under exclusion to gain access to opportunities. Amartya Sen stresses the need, given the adaptability of the language of exclusion, to adjust the rhetoric of exclusion to cover "unfavourable inclusion" as well. He speaks thus of "exclusion from equitable inclusion." As the Secretary-General observes, volunteering empowers people; it contributes to building solidarity, encourages participation and ownership, creates networks of reciprocity and reinforces a sense of collective responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk03-pa03">The richness of India's culture and heritage has produced many a noble tradition. It will not, therefore, be a surprise to this Assembly that volunteerism has formed an integral part of the Indian ethos known as <i>shramdaan</i>, or "donation of labour", in Indian society. In the years after India's independence, this social wealth was harnessed towards national development through the National Service Scheme. That scheme was introduced in 1969 with the aim of involving students on a voluntary and part-time basis which, while contributing to socio-economic development, would also stimulate social consciousness among the nation's youth. The success of this project led to the launching of the National Service Volunteer Scheme in 1977-1978, which envisaged participation in voluntary work on a full-time basis. A National Service volunteer would participate actively in the development process of the nation through service to the community. This was subsequently supplemented with another programme for non-student rural youth volunteers.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk03-pa04">Like many other nations, India too participated actively in the observance of the International Year of Volunteers and worked for its success, through the organization of a number of programmes, including conferences, workshops and youth camps, which enjoyed wide participation. India views volunteerism as a continuous and contributory process on the path of the nation's development. The country's highest developmental planning body, the Planning Commission, has been designated as the nodal agency for the voluntary sector in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk03-pa05">My delegation is a sponsor of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-57-L.8.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/L.8</a>, on follow-up to the International Year of Volunteers. We would like to thank the main sponsor, Brazil, for its effort in presenting the draft resolution. The draft resolution aims to ensure that the impetus provided to volunteerism during the International Year of Volunteers is sustained in the future. Our sponsorship of this draft resolution is a manifestation of our support for the noble work of the community of volunteers worldwide.</p>

	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">My delegation welcomed with enthusiasm the General Assembly's proclamation of the International Year of Volunteers, whose lofty goal is to promote and ensure cooperation in order to enhance people's lives.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">We believe that the Secretary-General's report and the provisions of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-57-L.8.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/L.8</a>, which was submitted today by the delegation of Brazil, reflect the principal undertakings and events held in the context of the International Year of Volunteers.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">We attach particular importance to the efforts made at the national level. In this connection, allow me to highlight the decision of the Government of Kyrgyzstan to create a national coordinating council charged with monitoring the process of the promulgation of the first law on volunteer activities.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">The Government of Kyrgyzstan, jointly with international organizations, is continuing to work I intensively within the framework of the General Assembly resolution on the International Year of Volunteers. A number of projects have been implemented, aimed, inter alia, at alleviating the plight of refugees. These include integration into Kyrgyzstan, voluntary repatriation, legal protection, conflict prevention and emergency planning. The outcome of the Year and the implementation of the projects undertaken have shed light on ways and means of developing the potential of volunteerism.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">In this context, the Government of Kyrgyzstan has undertaken, as a priority task, informational and promotional campaigns as well as efforts at the local level to involve citizens in volunteer activities, with a view to enabling non-governmental and other organizations effectively to tap the tremendous potential of volunteers.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">We are convinced that the need for volunteer activities is greater than ever, given global problems such as environmental deterioration, poverty, drug abuse and HIV/AIDS, all of which disproportionately affect the most vulnerable segments of society. We note also the trend towards the development of the activities of civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">We believe that cooperation among Governments and the private sector will further promote the development of volunteerism. We are convinced also that the Year, which is designed to increase recognition for, interaction with, and assistance and support to volunteers, can make a real contribution to raising awareness as to the achievements and future potential of volunteers. Proposals can also be made with a view to encouraging an ever-greater number of people to become involved and to ensuring the availability of the resources necessary to enhancing the effectiveness of volunteerism.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">We believe also that it is important to focus, at the level of local and international organizations, on the importance of the volunteer movement and on its potential to contribute to the resolution of society's problems. First and foremost, new organizations should be created that are charged with promoting volunteer movements and with creating conditions conducive to cooperation, in order to develop volunteer services at the local level.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">In Kyrgyzstan, for over two years now, a volunteer initiatives centre has been working to develop the volunteer movement. In the past year, that centre has witnessed increased interest on the part of organizations in involving volunteers in their activities. In this connection, a decision was taken to draft uniform standards on volunteer work. Such standards will be part of a universal system to recruit volunteers into various organizations and to coordinate, monitor and assess their work.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">I hope that the aforementioned draft, which will become the main regulatory document for volunteers and organizations in Kyrgyzstan, will make it possible to organize our work more professionally and enable us to share our experiences in developing this area.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Laurin</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">There was a time when volunteering was seen as an activity to usefully fill the time of the recently retired, to earn extra credits for high-school students, or as a temporary response to emergencies. Useful, certainly, but of marginal social impact and economic significance.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">Any lingering support for this point of view should have been entirely dispelled by the Secretary-General's comprehensive report. The report demonstrates the enormous contribution made by volunteers, not only in response to emergencies but on an ongoing basis. Governments and societies around the world, in both developed and developing countries, depend on the volunteer sector in a number of ways: first, for their dedication and capacity to react quickly in response to new challenges; secondly, for their expertise and detailed knowledge of the situation on the ground; and thirdly, for their capacity as advocates for those who need assistance and as constructive critics of Government policy.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">Of equal or greater significance than its economic impact is the social impact of volunteering, both at the macro level and at the level of relationships between individuals. Volunteering is of benefit both to those who receive assistance and to those who provide it. In many cases, there is no clear distinction between the two. Volunteering, at its best, is the act of fully participating in the development of one's own society. We encourage all Governments to tap into this immense potential, seeking guidance in this regard from the "Recommendations on support for volunteering" annexed to the resolution we adopted last year.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">I salute the valuable work of United Nations Volunteers, under the leadership of its Executive Coordinator, Sharon Capeling-Alakija. Canada was pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the success of the United Nations Volunteers' launch of a global web site for the International Year of Volunteers, which has provided crucial support in assisting volunteer groups in the formation of national, regional and international networks. These networks play a useful role in enhancing coordination and in encouraging volunteer groups to share and build expertise.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">I also commend the efforts of Brazil to enhance the profile of the International Year of Volunteers and related follow-up activities. Canada was pleased to co-sponsor the draft resolution submitted by the delegation of Brazil on this subject.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">Canada has a strong tradition of volunteering, as evidenced by our large voluntary sector, which consists of an estimated 180,000 non-profit organizations -- of which 80,000 are registered as charities -- and hundreds of thousands more volunteer groups that are not incorporated. In 2000, 6.5 million Canadians volunteered their time to a voluntary sector organization, and the sector employed a further 1.3 million people. This diverse multitude of organizations ranges from small community-based groups to large, national umbrella organizations and includes such organizations as neighbourhood associations, service clubs, advocacy coalitions, food banks, shelters, transition houses, symphonies and local sports clubs.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">Events that were held throughout the year across Canada included the Global Youth Service Day, the National Volunteer Week, the National Youth Summit, the Canadian Forum on Volunteerism, the release of the results of the second Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating, the CIVICUS 2001 World Assembly and the International Conference on Volunteer Administration. All of these contributed to making 2001 an unequalled success and to increasing the role and definition of volunteers domestically.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">On 5 December 2001, as the Year drew to a close, Prime Minister Chrtien announced the Canada Volunteerism Initiative (CVI) as a legacy of the International Year of Volunteers. With funding of $43 million over five years, the initiative marks the Government's continued commitment to encouraging and promoting volunteerism and supporting the voluntary sector in Canada. The CVI has three main goals: to encourage Canadians to participate in voluntarism; to improve the capacity of organizations to benefit from the contribution of volunteers; and to enhance the experience of volunteering.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">Also on 5 December 2001, the Prime Minister signed a landmark accord between the Government of Canada and the voluntary sector -- a blueprint to guide the relationship between the federal Government and the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Canada is also committed to funding for an enhanced Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating, as well as for the Satellite Account of Non-Profit Institutions and Volunteering. In October 2002, the Government announced the appointment of a Minister responsible for the voluntary sector. The role of the Minister is to ensure that the Government's commitments under the accord are fulfilled.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">Before concluding my statement by paying tribute to the essential contributions of volunteers to the development of their societies, I am pleased to announce that on 5 December, the sculpture presented by Canada to the United Nations to mark the end of the International Year of Volunteers will be unveiled at the headquarters of the United Nations Volunteers in Bonn.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Grollov</span> <span class="nation">Czech Republic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa01">The Czech Republic fully associates itself with the statement delivered earlier by Denmark on behalf of the European Union (EU). Like those of the EU countries, the competent bodies in the Czech Republic paid great attention to the International Year of Volunteers, proclaimed by the United Nations in 2001. Our aim was to increase the awareness of the general public of the ideas and objectives of volunteerism. To this end, a National Coordinating Committee for the International Year was set up in the Czech Republic to focus on the following three priorities: the promotion and presentation of the Year in the Czech Republic; support for incorporating the term "volunteerism" in Czech legislation; and the promotion of particular voluntary projects.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa02">Working groups were set up for each of those fields, composed of members of the National Coordinating Committee and other invited experts. Throughout 2001, all the priority tasks were gradually carried out. Several international conferences were also organized in the Czech Republic during 2001, during which contacts with foreign partners and exchanges of experience proved to be most helpful for the Czech public and voluntary organizations and, we hope, for their foreign partners as well.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa03">The promotional element is an important aspect of the process without which no voluntary programme could develop effectively. Voluntary actions were announced in a number of daily newspapers and magazines and on the radio and television during the International Year. Views on particular projects were presented in the mass media by representatives of non-profit organizations involved in voluntary activities, both in the Czech Republic and abroad. The opening of an Internet volunteers portal is also worthy of mention. That database of available volunteers and programmes was inaugurated during the Year.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa04">Public presentations and media campaigns in support of voluntary activities remain one of the main means by which the Czech Government further disseminates information about the potential of volunteerism in modern society, thus rehabilitating the idea of volunteerism, which was greatly devalued in our country under the communist regime.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa05">Volunteerism is a phenomenon that is very sensitive to institutionalization. Goodwill or the need to be of help leads to a volunteer's decision to commit his or her own efforts and time to others. Such a decision can only be made voluntarily. However, because of the need to ensure the voluntary nature of such actions and an appropriate level of responsibility on the part of all involved, we also recognized the need for an adequate legislative framework for such activities. To this end, during the International Year of Volunteers the Czech Republic decided to pass an act on voluntary service. That legal instrument was initiated by the Czech Government in close cooperation with civil society, and based on a earlier analysis of field practice and the operative Czech legislation relating to voluntary service. The aim of the act was not to regulate or limit existing, considerably varied forms of voluntary service and activities, but to clearly define their operational mode and the conditions under which the Government could promote them.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa06">Although the International Year proved very fruitful, one year is not enough to exert sufficient influence on the attitude of nations towards volunteerism. The Czech Government has therefore also paid due attention to the follow-up of the Year. The Act on Voluntary Service was approved by parliament in April 2002 and will enter into force on 1 January 2003, thus creating basic legal conditions for further dynamic developments in this field. The State administration bodies are currently preparing suitable mechanisms for granting accreditation to volunteers' organizations, on the basis of which such non-profit organizations can obtain governmental subsidies in support of their activities.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa07">In the context of the International Year of Volunteers, the Czech Government also earmarked funds for support to voluntary programmes and projects. At the recommendation of the National Coordinating Committee, those funds were divided up in the form of a special subsidy among the 23 best-evaluated Czech volunteer organizations operating in the Czech Republic. In addition to making an annual contribution to the United Nations Volunteers Special Voluntary Fund, the Czech Government has highlighted its interest in cooperating with the United Nations Volunteers by signing, at the end of 2001, a full funding agreement. This arrangement will enable the Government to fully fund, through the United Nations Volunteers, the engagement of an increasing number of Czech volunteers in various United Nations projects and programmes abroad.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa08">The Government of the Czech Republic appreciates the report of the Secretary-General on the International Year of Volunteers: outcomes and future perspectives, and reaffirms its readiness to participate actively in future United Nations activities in the area of the development of volunteering and of volunteering in development.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa09">In conclusion, I should like, from this lofty rostrum, to thank, on behalf of the Government of the Czech Republic, the Czech volunteers who, during the damaging floods last summer, proved what an irreplaceable role they play in our society, as well as all volunteers worldwide for their courage, unselfishness, solidarity and humanity.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Garcia</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I am honoured to speak before the Assembly on this important agenda item dealing with social development. Since it is my first time addressing this body, allow me to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">Today we pay tribute to all volunteers of the world for their contribution to the socio-economic and cultural causes of nations. The report of the Secretary-General, <a href="../pdf/A-57-352.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/352</a>, lists the priceless work that they have done for society. We must therefore continue to ensure that this initiative will continue to bear fruit in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa03">During the World Summit for Social Development, in 1995, we committed ourselves to alleviating poverty, promoting full employment and securing social integration. We renewed that commitment in Geneva five years later and committed ourselves to increasing the mobilization of resources to meet those goals.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa04">We recognize that, after the proclamation of 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers, the work of volunteers towards meeting social and economic development agendas of nations has increased. The Millennium Declaration builds on that effort by encouraging citizens to contribute towards its goals.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa05">My delegation sees volunteerism as a vehicle by which vulnerable groups and those who are marginalized, including youth, older persons, disabled people, families and other social groups, can be part of a country's socio-economic and cultural endeavour. Volunteers are an untapped resource of a country. Once harnessed, their work is estimated to be 8 to 12 per cent of a nation's total gross domestic product. Their role in society has been recognized by the international community, and we commend the United Nations for launching the work of the United Nations Volunteers programme in 130 countries.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa06">Volunteerism provides an opportunity to reinforce the means and capabilities of people from different levels of society to engage in activities that are self-beneficial, as well as beneficial to their respective communities and to the nation.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa07">My delegation deems it important that youth be given a chance to acquire technical and life skills through volunteering. Creating opportunities for young people to influence development processes enables them to make their invaluable contribution to the country's socio-economic goals. The initiative and energy of young people can be harnessed to more productive endeavours that will benefit society as a whole, including in the fight against poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa08">According to a study of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), poverty and social fragmentation are the main causes of illicit drug use. It was observed that drug use is high in cities where individuals are separated from their communities. Thus, nations must stress to its youth the social benefits of volunteer action among its youth to counteract the negative effects of the vicious circle of drug abuse and poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa09">It is our view that, through volunteer work, older persons are given the opportunity to continue to contribute to society without having to deal with the structure of a workplace. The recently adopted Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing recognizes that older persons can make valuable contributions through voluntary activities. The Philippines also supports the Macau Declaration on Ageing for Asia and the Pacific, which emphasizes the contributions that older persons are making and can still make to society. It stresses the positive role of older persons and that those persons can continue to have a productive and meaningful role in the community through volunteer work.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa10">My delegation believes that, through volunteerism, the poor can be part of the solution in the fight against poverty. Involving the poor in decision-making processes that will affect their lives makes them more accountable for their actions.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa11">In my country, volunteers are involved in various phases of policy-making. During the planning phase, they are part of the preparation of the Philippine medium-term development plan, through regional consultations among various sectors of society. In the implementation phase, volunteers in the Philippines are given the opportunity to choose the programmes that are available to them through what we call the volunteer desks. These desks also serve to recruit volunteers on a regular basis. To give further impetus to the role of volunteers, the Philippine House of Representatives recently adopted a resolution that supports further consultations on volunteerism.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa12">The challenge that the international community must meet today is to build on the momentum of the International Year of Volunteers so that we can continue to energize youth, the ageing population and other vulnerable sectors in society through volunteerism. The private sector, particularly the media, must work closely with civil society and Government to seek programmes and processes that harness volunteer work in meeting society's socio-economic goals. More innovative ways must be developed to increase opportunities for volunteers and to mobilize them to implement the recommendations made by international conferences and summits.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa13">Let us, as members of the international community, make a firm commitment to ensure a conducive environment for voluntary action to prosper in our world.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khalid</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">The promotion of social development and a better standard of life are among the fundamental objectives of every society. While primary responsibility for attaining social development rests with the Governments concerned, an inclusive endeavour by all segments of society towards that end cannot be overemphasized. It is against this backdrop that factoring volunteerism into policy formulation and the implementation of plans attains greater relevance.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">The role of volunteers was formally acknowledged by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, at which it recommended the promotion of volunteering in social development. It encouraged Governments to develop comprehensive strategies and programmes by raising public awareness about the value and opportunities of volunteerism. Governments were to facilitate the creation of enabling environments for voluntary activities, and the private sector was to support such activities. Volunteerism has also remained at centre stage of United Nations activities as a valuable, cross-cutting phenomenon.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa03">The year 2001 was celebrated as the International Year of Volunteers. That helped to enhance recognition of the importance of volunteerism in addressing socio-economic needs. In that context, we welcome the Secretary-General's report contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-352.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/352</a>. We compliment him on his vision of volunteerism and its possible role in realizing a just and equitable world. It is gratifying that volunteerism has been assigned a greater role in the development efforts of several Member States. We also appreciate the valuable contribution made by United Nations Volunteers and its Executive Coordinator in encouraging articulation of the four goals of the Year: enhancing the recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteerism by Government and civil society actors.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa04">The genesis of volunteerism in Pakistan can be traced to the Pakistan movement. In the 1940s, during the struggle of Muslims in British India for a separate homeland, Pakistan entered its final and most crucial phase. Thousands of Muslim student volunteers transformed themselves into a network of political activists spreading the message of their leader, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah, across the South Asian subcontinent. Again, soon after Pakistan's coming into existence, thousands of volunteers assisted the nascent administration of Pakistan in the rehabilitation of millions of refugees who had crossed over from India. Ever since then, volunteerism has been an integral part of Pakistan's socio-economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa05">Today Pakistan is evolving a new approach to development. Traditional resources are not sufficient to meet human development needs in Pakistan. Alternative sources of financing and human resources are essential to facilitate development. We are conscious that volunteerism can play a key role in supporting human development endeavours in Pakistan. Accordingly, the Government has taken a number of initiatives. The National Commission for Human Development, which was formed in June of last year, will function as a body instrumental for both public and private human development efforts and will have a presence in every district in Pakistan. It is the first initiative of its kind in our country.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa06">In line with the United Nations International Year of Volunteers, the National Commission has created a national volunteer corps as a part of its broader agenda. It draws on the skills and motivation of volunteers at the grass-roots level to help meet development objectives in education, health and poverty alleviation. Pakistan has also become the first country to set up a human development fund in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to achieve poverty alleviation and human development. We appreciate the continued interest of UNDP in that endeavour. Pakistan is also the first country to establish a public-private partnership for human development following last year's Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa07">We are committed to tapping the spirit of volunteerism and the potential of our people in an organized manner. We will leverage global resources and involve all tiers of society to bring about effective transformation. Initially, the goal of the national volunteer corps during its first three years was to mobilize 100,000 volunteers. But the interest of the people and their eagerness to be part of the process might take the figure beyond 500,000. That will involve large-scale mobilization of local people and expatriates. The corps will also recruit Pakistani volunteers abroad through an on-line volunteering service. The National Commission is also developing a system to match volunteer skill sets with the operational needs of the organization in order to support its programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa08">We in Pakistan are committed to continuing to actively build on that momentum in our communities and to making them the key drivers of success. We consider volunteerism as a bridge to bring various segments of society closer to the common goal of human development.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, we would like to express our appreciation for the efforts of Brazil in introducing the draft resolution on this subject (<a href="../pdf/A-57-L.8.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/L.8</a>), which Pakistan has been happy to sponsor.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Acting President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01"> In accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-2.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 49/2</a>, of 19 October 1994, I now give the floor to the observer for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Katevas de Sclabos</span> <span class="non-nation">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is taking the floor this year to address the subject of volunteers and volunteerism. We will also address some of our basic concerns with regard to the special vulnerability of ageing populations, disabled persons and families. We will also speak about the contribution that young people can make, and are making, through their participation in volunteer networks all around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">A year has passed since the end of the International Year of Volunteers. In our view, the International Year of Volunteers was a resounding success. That success was due not so much to what has taken place in the field -- much remains to be done there -- but, rather, to the renewed commitment demonstrated in various areas. The International Federation has also noted that many other regional, national and international non-profit organizations received a boost from the International Year of Volunteers and renewed their own commitment to it. In our statement to the General Assembly a year ago, at the time of the conclusion of the International Year of Volunteers, we anticipated that there would be an increase in joint activities with other organizations sharing that renewed commitment. I have the honour today to state that we are almost in a position to announce the birth of a new and interesting partnership that will make it possible to mobilize intense and sustained attention to issues that will be decisive for the future of volunteerism at the beginning of the new millennium.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">In our statement last year we also mentioned our work with the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). On many occasions we have also spoken about the fruitful and stimulating relationship we have with the United Nations Volunteers programme. The International Forum of Business Leaders is another organization with which we have established a close and productive relationship in the context of volunteerism. Along with the International Federation, those organizations make up a huge alliance of innovative leaders, individuals and organizations that has a real and ongoing need for the constant involvement of volunteers. We intend to take advantage of every possible opportunity to join our efforts in order to achieve the objectives that prompted the United Nations to declare the year 2001 the International Year of Volunteers.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">It is the hope of the International Federation that this partnership may become a reality very soon. When that happens, it will be possible for the new hopes about the future of volunteerism to bear fruit. Civil society, businesses, legislators from all countries and the international community itself will be working together to eliminate all the obstacles that stand in the way of the expansion of volunteerism and to seek ways and means of inculcating the spirit of volunteerism at the local, national, regional and global levels.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">There are many millions of non-profit volunteer organizations all around the world. Although the International Federation and its member societies -- the national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies -- represent the largest network in the world, it is important to pay tribute to all those people, including elderly people, children, women and men, who selflessly lend their assistance to the benefit of the communities in which they live.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">Unfortunately, there is no doubt that the pressures brought to bear on families and individuals in the contemporary world and its economies have made it much more difficult for people to offer their time with the same generosity as they have in the past. At the same time, there is a disturbingly large number of Governments that do not appear to have recognized the importance of volunteers for the well-being of their own communities.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">We shall not dwell on the contributions made by volunteers at any great length, because they are well known. However, some examples will undoubtedly help us lay the bases for the action that we wish Governments to undertake. In the Syrian Arab Republic, national Red Crescent Society volunteers played a crucial role in the planning and delivery of assistance to persons affected by the collapse of the Zeyoun dam at the beginning of June this year. Volunteers reached the disaster site within a few hours and immediately provided extremely necessary material and human assistance to the villages. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society and its volunteers play a very clear-cut function in all the disaster preparedness work in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">In my country, Chile, the national Red Cross Society has 21,780 volunteers, of whom 14,456 are young people. Those volunteers, and those of many other organizations, have traditionally played a key role in intervention activities in emergencies and disasters. The Chilean Red Cross Society responds whenever its assistance is requested, working closely with the Government and other associated organizations. In fact, at the same time that the Zeyoun dam disaster was taking place in Syria, more than 2,500 volunteers from 189 Chilean Red Cross chapters were providing relief and assistance to approximately 12,000 victims of heavy flooding. Those are good examples of the constant need to be able to rely on well-prepared volunteers to work together with Government agencies and with other non-profit voluntary organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">Around the world, the national societies members of the International Federation mobilize volunteers in the fight against HIV/AIDS and in support of anti-stigmatization campaigns, which are regarded by all those working in that field as absolutely crucial in tackling the challenge of that terrible pandemic.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">We are not asking Governments to create volunteers. They cannot do that. However, Governments can, without realizing it, create conditions that make it difficult for communities to set up their own volunteer networks. There are many countries, even in the developed world, where Governments have not realized that volunteerism is a delicate concept and is subject to challenges. It needs a favourable environment in order to flourish and continue to yield the tremendous benefits of quality volunteer service in the community. We urge Governments, and perhaps most usefully with the support of their own legislators, business leaders and volunteer organizations such as the national Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, to embark on a systematic review of the current context in which volunteerism is developing in their countries. We urge Governments to include in that review all the aspects of the laws and regulations that may have an impact on the development and growth of volunteerism, including in particular tax laws, the right to employment, competition regulation, legal protection of volunteers and laws that promote training.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">The International Federation tackles this issue in a very serious way. The next occasion on which all our national societies will be able to review this issue directly with their Governments, in order to address all the aspects that I have just mentioned, will be in December 2003 at the next International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. In connection with one of the agenda items of that conference, Governments and national societies -- the participants in the international conferences of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement -- will be studying ways in which the commitments undertaken at the last International Conference, held in December 1999, have been put into effect. Several of those commitments related to volunteerism. In Final Goal 3.3 of the International Plan of Action adopted at the Conference, States declared that they would review legislation and, when appropriate, enact norms and update them with a view to facilitating the effective work of the relevant volunteer organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa12">That commitment is still the central element of today's message, a year after the International Year of Volunteers. It is the central element of the work that we shall be carrying out together with our partners. It is also the main message that the International Federation, together with our colleagues and with the United Nations Volunteers programme, have just communicated to the seventeenth World Volunteer Conference, organized by the International Association for Volunteer Effort in Seoul from 11 to 15 November 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa13">Much is being done today in this field. That is why we urge our Governments to join this endeavour and embrace our resolve to create a favourable environment for volunteerism in all countries all around the world.</p>
