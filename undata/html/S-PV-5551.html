<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bolton</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">We welcome the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1718(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1718 (2006)</a>. The proclaimed test of a nuclear device by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea unquestionably poses one of the gravest threats to international peace and security that the Council has ever had to confront. Today we are sending a strong and clear message to North Korea and other would-be proliferators that there will be serious repercussions in continuing to pursue weapons of mass destruction (WMD).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">Three months ago, the Council sent an unequivocal and unambiguous message to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea: suspend your ballistic missile programme, stop your procurement of materials related to weapons of mass destruction and verifiably dismantle your nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1695(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1695 (2006)</a> also demonstrated to North Korea that the best way to improve the livelihood of its people and end its international isolation was to stop playing games of brinkmanship, comply with the demands of the Security Council, return to the Six-Party Talks and implement the terms of the Joint Statement from the last round of those talks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">Sadly, the regime in Pyongyang chose a disturbingly different path. It answered the Security Council's demands with yet another direct threat to international peace and security, proclaiming to the world that it had conducted a successful nuclear-weapons test. With its actions, the North Korean regime has one again broken its word, provoked an international crisis and denied its people the opportunity for a better life.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">Three months ago, the United States counselled the members of this body to be prepared for further action in the event that North Korea failed to make the strategic decision to give up its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1695(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1695 (2006)</a>. We are pleased that the Security Council is united in condemning the actions by the regime in Pyongyang and in taking clear, firm and punitive action in passing this resolution, thus proving to North Korea and others that the Security Council is prepared to meet threats to international security with swift resolve.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">This resolution demands action. Acting under Chapter VII, it has imposed punitive sanctions on Kim Jong Il's regime. It has broad provisions deciding that Member States shall not engage in any trade with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, not only for items that could contribute to their nuclear weapons and other WMD programmes but for high-end military equipment as well. The United States will rely on a number of control lists already in place as a baseline to implement the decision by the Security Council to ban trade with North Korea in WMD-related materials, including lists published by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Australia Group. To further that goal, this resolution also prevents the travel of Government officials of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea who are known to be involved in their WMD efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">This resolution also targets other illicit activities of the regime in Pyongyang and includes a ban on trade in luxury goods. It targets the way Kim Jong Il finances his weapons of mass destruction programmes, through criminal activities like money-laundering, counterfeiting and the selling of narcotics. It imposes a binding requirement on all Member States to take action against those activities and freeze the assets of entities and individuals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea involved.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">The resolution also provides for a regime of inspection to ensure compliance with its provisions, building on the existing work of the Proliferation Security Initiative. The resolution imposes other strict demands on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It requires Pyongyang not to conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic missile. It demands that North Korea abandon all of its WMD programmes, including nuclear, chemical and biological weapon programmes, in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">It is our understanding that the full compliance of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with this resolution and the successful resumption of the Six-Party Talks would lead to the Council acting to lift the measures imposed by the resolution. At the same time, we need to be prepared if North Korea again decides to ignore the Security Council and continue its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. That is why it is important that the United States and other Member States have the opportunity at any point in time to strengthen measures against North Korea and return to the Council for further action.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa09">As we pursue a diplomatic solution, we are also reassuring our allies in the region that America remains committed to their security. In response to North Korea's provocation, we will seek to increase our defence cooperation with our allies, including cooperation on ballistic missile defence, to protect against North Korean aggression, and cooperation to prevent North Korea from importing or exporting nuclear or other missile technologies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa10">Our goals remain clear: peace and security in North-East Asia and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. We will support our allies in the region, we will work with the Security Council and, together, we will ensure that North Korea faces serious consequences if it continues down its current path.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa11">Let me end with a final point. This resolution provides a carve-out for humanitarian relief efforts in North Korea. The reason is clear: the concern of the Security Council is with the regime in Pyongyang, not the starving and suffering people of North Korea. We hope that North Korea implements and complies fully with the provisions of this resolution, in the hope that its people can have a brighter future.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De La Sablière</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">By adopting <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1718(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1718 (2006)</a> today, the Security Council has responded firmly to last Monday's announcement of a nuclear test by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This firm response voices universal condemnation of that extremely serious act and the international community's determination with respect to the behaviour of Pyongyang.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">This resolution, under Chapter VII of the Charter, sets out a number of strong measures regarding the military programmes of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in particular those related to missiles and weapons of mass destruction. It was necessary in particular to put an end to the importing and exporting by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of material associated with those programmes. It was necessary also to ensure the effectiveness of these measures through cooperation by States, acting in conformity with international law, in the inspection of cargo to and from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Given the challenge posed by North Korea and in a context in which we must confront other proliferation crises, it was essential for the international community to be united and extremely firm. Through its unanimous decision, the Security Council has clearly demonstrated that North Korea's conduct will not be tolerated.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">We understand that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's full compliance with this resolution and the successful resumption of the Six-Party Talks would prompt the Council to act to lift the measures imposed by the resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Guangya</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">The Security Council has just adopted a resolution on the nuclear test by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">On 9 October 2006, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea flagrantly conducted a nuclear test in disregard of the common opposition of the international community. This is not conducive to peace and stability in North-East Asia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement on the same day and expressed firm opposition to this act. Proceeding from the overall interests of bringing about denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia, China supports the Security Council in making firm and appropriate response. We believe that the action of the Security Council should both indicate the firm position of the international community and help create enabling conditions for the final peaceful solution to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear issue through dialogue. As the resolution basically reflects the aforementioned spirit, the Chinese delegation voted in favour of it.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">China would like to reiterate here that sanctions in themselves are not the end. As stipulated by the relevant provisions of the resolution, if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea complies with the relevant requests of the resolution, the Security Council will suspend or lift sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">At the same time, we wish to point out that China does not approve of the practice of inspecting cargo to and from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We therefore have reservations about the relevant provisions of the resolution. China strongly urges the countries concerned to adopt a prudent and responsible attitude in this regard and to refrain from taking any provocative steps that may intensify the tension.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">The Chinese Government has all along been committed to bringing about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia. We have always advocated seeking a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through diplomatic means. China has made enormous and unremitting efforts to that end. It initiated the Six-Party Talks and pushed parties concerned to reach the Joint Statement of September 2005. Although the negative development of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear test has emerged, our policies as just outlined remain unchanged. We still believe that the Six-Party Talks are the realistic way to handle the relevant issues. We also firmly oppose the use of force. China has noted with satisfaction that in condemning the nuclear test of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the parties concerned have all indicated the importance of adhering to diplomatic efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">China believes that under the current circumstances we should unswervingly stick to the objective of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, oppose nuclear proliferation, adhere to the general direction of resolving the issue through peaceful dialogue and negotiation, avoid any acts that may cause the tension to escalate and the situation to get out of control, and maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia. This is in the common interests of all the parties concerned. All the parties should make vigorous and positive efforts to this end. China is ready and willing to strengthen consultations and coordination with other parties concerned so as to respond in a cool-headed manner, push forward the six-party process and continue to play a constructive role in bringing about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">The United Kingdom welcomes the strong signal that this unanimous Security Council resolution sends to the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Security Council has acted decisively and quickly under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to the provocative and irresponsible acts of the regime. This resolution underlines powerfully to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea the importance of this issue and reiterates the international community's condemnation of its actions.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The requirements of this resolution are clear. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and all States concerned have a legal obligation to comply with its provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The United Kingdom has made clear its condemnation of the nuclear test that took place on 9 October. That was an irresponsible act by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that raised tensions regionally and internationally. The Democratic People's Republic carried out the test despite the repeated urgings of its neighbours and the wider international community. The test contravened the commitments of the Democratic People's Republic under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and ignored our own <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1695(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1695 (2006)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Against this background, the test cannot be seen as anything other than a direct provocation to the international community. It is a threat to international peace and security. The Council had a duty to condemn this behaviour. It was important, therefore, that the international community send a strong message to Pyongyang. It has done so in robust terms.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">But let me stress that the resolution is targeted at stopping the weapons of mass destruction and missile programmes and changing the behaviour of those in authority in Pyongyang. It is not aimed at the people of North Korea, who are already suffering greatly.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">We now expect the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to comply with the resolution and return to the six-party talks. If it does, and if it complies fully with the resolution's provisions and if the talks resume successfully, the United Kingdom would expect the Security Council to lift the measures imposed today.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">But the choice is for North Korea -- to accept the wishes of the international community, or to flout international law and the obligations we are imposing today.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Churkin</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">Even before statements by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on their intention to conduct a nuclear experiment and immediately after Pyongyang had acknowledged taking this irresponsible and destabilizing step, the Russian Federation emphasized that any actions of this nature -- whatever the reasons behind them -- could complicate the prospects for a settlement of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, which is already fraught with threats to peace, security and stability in the region, and could undermine the non-proliferation regime.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Based on this understanding, we have consistently called for a strong response on the part of the Security Council to this serious challenge to the entire international community, but at the same time a response that is carefully vetted and targeted to prevent further escalation of tension. We can only regret that the North Korean leadership ignored the warnings contained in the official presidential statement of the Security Council adopted on 6 October 2006 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-41.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/41</a>) on the deleterious consequences which would inevitably flow from a nuclear test, especially those that would befall the Democratic People's Republic of Korea itself.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">We all find ourselves in an extraordinary situation, one which requires us to adopt measures that are just as extraordinary. Having supported today's unanimous resolution, which was agreed to in intense negotiations in which all members of the Council participated constructively, we wish to note the following.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The resolution reflects a concern for the humanitarian consequences of these restrictive measures. In principle, it is extremely important that that be taken into account in the relevant United Nations decisions and that we carefully weigh the consequences on a case-by-case basis. In reacting this way to this emergency situation, we reaffirm our principled position that any sanctions measures introduced by the Security Council should not remain in place indefinitely and should be lifted if the Council's demands are met.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">We also believe it necessary to emphasize that, when the Council is working to reach agreement on common approaches, in which all interested parties are involved, the decision on this type of problem by no means promotes the practice of sanctions measures being taken by Governments in a one-sided way.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">The resolution adopted today contains a carefully studied and targeted set of measures to deal with the main problem, which is to bring the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to immediately correct its dangerous course in the nuclear area, to rejoin the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and, without precondition, to declare that it is ready to participate in the six-party talks. Achieving this goal, which arises directly from the resolution, can be done only through political and diplomatic means.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">These measures with respect to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea must be implemented under the strict and objective control of the Security Council and the sanctions committee established by this resolution. It is important that, as a result of the resolution, full implementation by the Democratic People's Republic of its provisions, including resumption of the six-party talks, leads to a decision by the Council to lift the sanctions regime it has imposed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">We hope that in Pyongyang the authorities will understand the collective position of the international community reflected in this resolution and that they will take practical steps aimed at achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the strengthening of peace and stability in north-east Asia. Russia will continue to do everything it can to achieve these goals.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mayoral</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Argentina has supported <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1718(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1718 (2006)</a> condemning the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for its proclamation of possession of nuclear weapons, its withdrawal from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, launching ballistic missiles and the recent nuclear test. All of that endangers international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">This unanimous, firm and rapid message from the Security Council, under the presidency of Japan, is a clear demonstration of the position adopted by the international community towards the action of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. My country hopes that this message will be heard by the authorities in that country and that that country will return to the six-party talks so that a solution can be found for all parties involved. We are confident that that could occur. After all, the attitude of the Democratic People's Republic affects not only the countries in the Asia-Pacific region, but the whole world.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">Argentina, which is a member of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, joined that body with a view to maintaining peace and security in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Finally, we would like to state our interpretation that documents <a href="../pdf/S-2006-814.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/814</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-2006-815.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/815</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2006-816.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/816</a>, have been circulated only for the specific purpose of identifying the items, materials, equipment, goods and technology referred to in operative paragraph 8 of the resolution we have just adopted. In other words, they are only for the specific case under consideration and in no way constitute an attempt by the Security Council to legislate on the control of dual-use material and technologies in areas that are covered by specific treaties.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Japan.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">Japan welcomes the resolution just adopted as one of the most important decisions the Security Council has taken in recent times on an issue of the gravest concern to the international community. It was essential that such an important decision be taken by a unanimous vote, and this is a welcome outcome. The resolution strongly condemns the irresponsible act on the part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which announced its intention and then proceeded to conduct a nuclear test in total defiance of the calls to refrain from doing so by all its immediate neighbours, and indeed by the entire world. That was unacceptable behaviour, which deserved to be met not only with strong admonishment but also with necessary measures prescribed in Chapter VII of the Charter. In the circumstances, the Security Council acted in the discharge of its responsibilities by responding to this grave situation created by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, swiftly and in unity. This we also welcome.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">The situation created by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the Korean peninsula has caused widespread and deep concern in East Asia and beyond. The danger presented by Pyongyang's total disregard of the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is clear and present. Last July, when the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resorted to the launching of ballistic missiles, the Security Council unanimously adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1695(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1695 (2006)</a>, condemning the action.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Responding to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's announcement of an impending nuclear test, the international community unequivocally urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to exercise maximum restraint, including through the issuance by the Security Council of a strong presidential statement (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-41.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/41</a>) advising the Democratic People's Republic of Korea not to go forward with the test. Only two days after the call from the Security Council, however, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea claimed that it had conducted a nuclear test. The combination of ballistic missile capability and, now, the claim of nuclear capability in the hands of a regime with a known and proven record of reckless and irresponsible acts and behaviour, including as a proliferator, creates a situation which is nothing less than a grave threat to peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Japan also regrets that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's actions are in contravention of the Japan-Democratic People's Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration, the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks and several other agreements to which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has committed itself.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">Japan, along with other concerned countries in the region and beyond, expects that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will act as a responsible Member of the United Nations by implementing this and other relevant Security Council resolutions and decisions, including <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1695(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1695 (2006)</a>, in good faith and sincerely addressing the voices of concern raised by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">At the same time, it is important to note that the security issue is not the only point of contention between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the international community. This resolution underlines the importance of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea responding to humanitarian concerns of the international community, which naturally include the abduction issue. We demand that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resolve this issue as early as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">Prior to the adoption of this resolution, on 11 October 2006, my Government announced that it would take a set of national measures in strong protest against the claimed nuclear test, recognizing the need to take firm measures in response to such an action. These measures included denial of permission to enter Japanese ports to all Democratic People's Republic of Korea vessels, denial of import of all items from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and denial in principle of entry by Democratic People's Republic of Korea nationals into Japanese territory.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">Japan will also implement in good faith the measures that Member States are obligated to take under this resolution. We urge other Member States to swiftly implement the resolution's provisions as well.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">This resolution contains strong measures, but sanctions are not invoked for the sake of sanctions. The goal of this resolution is to remove the threat to international peace and security by ensuring the discontinuation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear testing and ballistic missile launchings as well as the abandonment of its nuclear and missile programmes. It is up to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea whether this opportunity will be seized and utilized. Japan wishes to stress that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's compliance with this resolution and its addressing the concerns of the international community will open the way for the Security Council to consider actions for the benefit of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as made clear in paragraph 15 of the resolution. Japan has not closed the door on dialogue and urges the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to respond sincerely for a diplomatic solution to the issues outstanding between the two countries.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">I now give the floor to the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pak Gil Yon</span> <span class="nation">Democratic People's Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea totally rejects the unjustifiable <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1718(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1718 (2006)</a>, adopted by the Security Council just now. It is gangster-like for the Security Council to have adopted today a coercive resolution, while neglecting the nuclear threat, moves for sanctions and pressure of the United States against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This clearly testifies that the Security Council has completely lost its impartiality and persists in applying double standards in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses its disappointment over the fact that the Security Council finds itself incapable of saying even a word of concern to the United States, which threatens the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with nuclear pre-emptive attack and aggravates tension by reinforcing armed forces and conducting large-scale joint military exercises near the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">As was already declared, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea successfully conducted an underground nuclear test under secure conditions on 9 October as a new measure for bolstering its war deterrent for self-defence. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear test was entirely attributable to the United States nuclear threat, sanctions and pressure.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has exerted every possible effort to settle the nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiations, prompted by its sincere desire to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The Bush Administration, however, responded to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's patient and sincere effort and magnanimity with a policy of sanctions and blockade. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was compelled to substantially prove its possession of nukes to protect its sovereignty and the right to existence from the daily increasing danger of war from the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Although the Democratic People's Republic of Korea conducted the nuclear test due to the United States, it remains unchanged in its will to denuclearize the peninsula through dialogue and negotiations. The denuclearization of the entire peninsula was President Kim Il Sung's last instruction and is the ultimate goal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear test does not contradict the 19 September Joint Statement, under which it committed itself to dismantling its nuclear weapons and to abandoning its existing nuclear programme. On the contrary, it constitutes a positive measure for its implementation. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has clarified more than once that it would feel no need to possess even a single nuclear weapon once it was no longer exposed to the United States threat and after that country had dropped its hostile policy towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and confidence had been built between the two countries.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">The United States has sought to impose collective sanctions upon the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by manipulating the Security Council to adopt a resolution pressuring Pyongyang. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is ready for both dialogue and confrontation. If the United States persistently increases pressure upon the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, my country will continue to take physical countermeasures, considering such pressure to be a declaration of war.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Choi</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">Last Monday, 9 October, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced that it had conducted a nuclear test. Pyongyang did so in complete disregard of the repeated warnings of my Government and the international community. The action taken by North Korea poses a grave threat, undermining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and beyond.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">North Korea also betrayed the hope of the international community to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue. North Korea's conduct constitutes a failure to meet its obligations under the 19 September 2005 Joint Statement, on which all parties to the Six-Party Talks concurred. North Korea's conduct is in outright defiance of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1695(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1695 (2006)</a>, adopted on 15 July.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Further, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's action constitutes an unacceptable breach of the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula that it signed with my country in 1991. In that context, we have made it clear that North Korea's acts will never be condoned and that their impact on inter-Korean relations can only be negative.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">My Government appreciates the efforts of the members of the Security Council to address this grave common challenge. My Government supports fully the resolution just adopted unanimously by the Security Council. We urge North Korea to heed carefully the united voice of the international community and to refrain from any action that would further aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula. North Korea should return immediately to the Six-Party Talks without any preconditions. North Korea should abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programmes once and for all.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Working in close cooperation with the international community, my Government will pursue its endeavours to achieve those goals.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I am not going to waste any of our time responding to what the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea said, but I want to call members' attention to that empty chair. This is the second time in three months that the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, having asked to participate in our meetings, has rejected a unanimous resolution of the Security Council and walked out of this Chamber. It is the contemporary equivalent of Nikita Khrushchev pounding his shoe on the rostrum of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">That empty chair raises questions about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's adherence to Chapter II of the United Nations Charter, which I think we need to consider in due course.</p>
