It contains the allocation of items for plenary meetings, First Committee and Fourth Committee, but it does not contain the text of the allocation of items to the Second, Third, Fifth or Sixth Committees.</div>

I understand that the staff of the Secretariat make a great effort, working carefully and to the best of their abilities to provide us with good documentation, so I do not want to complicate their lives. However, I believe that this incident is revealing of the fact that the staff of the General Assembly and of the documentation and language services are working under excessive pressure. This type of incident shows that there are limits to the pressure that one can impose on staff. I believe that our friends in the Secretariat are working hard; perhaps they are working too hard, and this is the result of such overwork.</div>

	Mr. Dlamini (Swaziland)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I wish to echo the spirit of understanding that you, Mr. President, expressed towards the delegation of France, which has received by mistake a document that is not in its language, one of the official languages of the United Nations. I am sure that in the near future the United Nations will have to reconsider the question of languages very carefully, especially given the fact that now there are so many Members of this body whose languages are not regarded as languages because they are not among the six that are used. I, for instance, would like to speak my language, siSwati, here, in order to express myself better in debates. However, we appreciate the understanding offered to the delegation of France.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa02">In addition, I wish to make the observation that a document of this significance should in future be made ready before we come here to adopt the recommendations in the report. In my view, this would allow delegations to peruse the document, see the mistakes and inadvertent omissions and also, perhaps, see where we could make the necessary changes so that the document could be adopted holistically. But when we receive the document only when we arrive here it gives us very little time to understand fully the proposals that we are to adopt. The mistake observed by France, for instance, could have been observed yesterday instead of today.</div>

I hope the Main Committees will continue with the effort they demonstrated in the fifty-first session in concluding their work on time. I personally intend to ensure that we all keep to our commitment taken today.</div>
