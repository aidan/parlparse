	<p id="docA52PV4-pg008-bk08-pa01">I would like to take this opportunity to inform the General Assembly that the President is now undertaking very extensive consultations, since this issue was raised in the meeting of the General Committee, to determine the mechanism of the consideration of the Secretary-General's report on reform of the United Nations. Certainly, the Assembly in plenary meeting will make a decision on the format of the mechanism on this issue.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV4-pg008-bk13-pa01">My comments are not related to the issue raised by the two previous speakers, but to the fact that, with regard to paragraph 51 of the version of the text from which I am working, the text distributed to us is incomplete. It contains the allocation of items for plenary meetings, First Committee and Fourth Committee, but it does not contain the text of the allocation of items to the Second, Third, Fifth or Sixth Committees.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV4-pg008-bk13-pa02">In principle, in such a case as this my delegation would not be in a position to associate itself with the adoption of the recommendations proposed to us in the report of the General Committee. We are therefore in a difficult position. However, the Secretariat has apologized to us and has indicated that the corrected version of the text -- at least, the French version -- will be given to us without delay.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV4-pg008-bk13-pa03">Having expressed my reservations, and given the assurances provided to us, I do not want to create problems for the adoption of the recommendations in paragraph 51 in this exceptional case. I understand that the staff of the Secretariat make a great effort, working carefully and to the best of their abilities to provide us with good documentation, so I do not want to complicate their lives. However, I believe that this incident is revealing of the fact that the staff of the General Assembly and of the documentation and language services are working under excessive pressure. This type of incident shows that there are limits to the pressure that one can impose on staff. I believe that our friends in the Secretariat are working hard; perhaps they are working too hard, and this is the result of such overwork.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV4-pg008-bk13-pa04">I do not want to aggravate matters for them -- if I may be permitted to use that expression -- so I will let this pass. But I trust that the definitive corrected version will be given to us as soon as possible. We have been given the text in English, but of course the English text cannot suffice.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV4-pg009-bk01-pa01"> I should like to assure the representative of France that the Secretariat and the presidency will undertake all necessary measures to have all documents issued in all the official languages of the Organization promptly and on time. As the Assembly is well aware, this bulky document was approved only yesterday by the General Committee, and I convened the plenary meeting at 11 o'clock instead of at 10 o'clock, as originally scheduled, to provide an opportunity for the documentation and other services of the Secretariat to issue all the documents. However, that has not been the case. I can assure delegations that the Secretariat and I will do our best to have documents issued on time. I am grateful to the distinguished representative of France for his cooperation and understanding of the situation.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV4-pg009-bk02-pa01">I wish to echo the spirit of understanding that you, Mr. President, expressed towards the delegation of France, which has received by mistake a document that is not in its language, one of the official languages of the United Nations. I am sure that in the near future the United Nations will have to reconsider the question of languages very carefully, especially given the fact that now there are so many Members of this body whose languages are not regarded as languages because they are not among the six that are used. I, for instance, would like to speak my language, siSwati, here, in order to express myself better in debates. However, we appreciate the understanding offered to the delegation of France.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV4-pg009-bk02-pa02">In addition, I wish to make the observation that a document of this significance should in future be made ready before we come here to adopt the recommendations in the report. In my view, this would allow delegations to peruse the document, see the mistakes and inadvertent omissions and also, perhaps, see where we could make the necessary changes so that the document could be adopted holistically. But when we receive the document only when we arrive here it gives us very little time to understand fully the proposals that we are to adopt. The mistake observed by France, for instance, could have been observed yesterday instead of today.</p>
