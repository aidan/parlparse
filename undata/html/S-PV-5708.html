	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">"The Security Council expresses its warm appreciation to the President and Chief Prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone for their briefing during the debate of the Security Council on 8 June 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">"The Security Council reiterates its strong support for the Special Court and commends the progress the Special Court has achieved.

	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the commencement of the trial of Charles Taylor on 4 June 2007 in The Hague following the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1688(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1688 (2006)</a>. The Security Council also congratulates the Special Court on handing down its first trial judgement on 21 June 2007 in the <i>AFRC</i> case.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council urges the international community to continue to support the Special Court as it moves into its final stage of work, including by ensuring that the remaining fugitive indictee appears before the Court.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council in particular takes note of the Special Court's ongoing needs for financial support. The Security Council emphasizes the vital need for further pledges of voluntary contributions in order to allow the Special Court to complete its mandate in a timely manner, and asks all United Nations Members State to consider making such pledges.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council also notes the other varied challenges facing the Special Court as it works to fulfil its mandate, and urges States to consider supporting the Special Court by entering into appropriate arrangements with the Special Court for witness relocation and enforcement of sentences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council recognizes that further arrangements will be needed to address residual matters after trials and appeals are completed, including issues arising from long-term enforcement of sentences for convicted persons, the future trial of any indictees remaining at large, witness protection and the preservation of the archives of the Special Court.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"Finally, the Security Council commends the important outreach activities of the Special Court in bringing its judicial work to the attention of the people of Sierra Leone, and thereby contributing to the restoration of the rule of law throughout the country and region."</p>
