	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the two suicide attacks that occurred in Algiers on 11 April 2007, causing numerous deaths and injuries, and expresses its deep sympathy and condolences to the victims of these heinous acts of terrorism and their families, and to the people and the Government of Algeria.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council underlines the need to bring perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism to justice, and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">1624 (2005)</a>, to cooperate actively with the Algerian authorities in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council further reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. The Council reminds States that they must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-10.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/10</a>.</p>
