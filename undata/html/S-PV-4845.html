	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">I now give the floor to Ambassador Arias.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="non-nation">Chairman of the Security Council Committee</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I speak today as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in order to brief you on the status of its work, and to submit to you the ninth work programme for the months of October to December 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">On 4 October, I completed six months as Chairman of the Committee. It has been a period in which a great deal of serious work has been done on our task of monitoring the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. There is no need to reiterate here the importance of the Security Council's work in the international community's fight against the threat to peace and security represented by terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, but I believe it is appropriate to emphasize that our Committee represents the consensus shared by all Members of the United Nations that affirms that it is necessary to struggle, by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, against acts of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Before presenting a brief summary of the content of the ninth work programme, I shall refer briefly to the implementation of what was agreed to in the eighth programme. With regard to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the Committee has continued reviewing the reports submitted by States in response to the letters addressed to them by the Committee. It should be noted that the rate of review has slowed down somewhat compared to previous periods because we are gradually entering a more complex phase of our work.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">As States move from stage A, which basically relates to verifying that adequate anti-terrorist legislation is in place, to stage B, which focuses on the actual implementation of these measures, the Committee has taken more time to review reports and draft letters.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">It has become necessary to find a balance between the amount of attention given to stage A and stage B States. For that purpose, we have prepared a working paper on the criteria for the drafting of letters and the need to give attention to all States in line with the principle of equal treatment, while providing the essential flexibility that will allow the Committee to maintain the proper follow-up of States' efforts to implement the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">In our work ensuring that all States become parties as soon as possible to the relevant international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, the CTC considered specifically the issue at one of its meetings, during which its team of experts presented a report on the status of State participation and of the positive impact of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and of the work of the Committee itself.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">Secondly, on the working methods of the Committee, we have continued our efforts to apply the criteria of coordination, transparency and equality of treatment to the circumstances of each case.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">Thirdly, in the field of technical assistance, we are still working to ensure that the Committee takes an increasingly active approach to its collaboration with those States which, although they have a real political will to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, are nonetheless facing difficulties in doing so.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Fourthly, with regard to transparency, the Committee's web page has been completely redesigned so as to be consulted as easily and quickly as possible. The English version is now fully operative and in the next few days the French and Spanish will also be ready. Lastly, the web page will also be available soon in Arabic, Chinese and Russian.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">Fifthly and lastly, in the context of cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations, ties have been strengthened between the Committee and those who are working more directly in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">On 7 October 2003, a second meeting was held with such organizations at the headquarters of the Organization of American States, in Washington, D.C., at which a great deal of information was exchanged. The Committee is pleased to have initiated this coordination process between international organizations and notes with satisfaction that it will continue in the future, since the next meeting has already been scheduled for March 2004 in Vienna.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">We have also taken steps to assure proper coordination between the CTC and the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. Both chairs have conducted a meeting with our respective experts, in which it was agreed that there will be periodic meetings to ensure better coordination between these two bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">Now I would like to address the general outlines of the ninth report, which run from October to December 2003. By 30 September 2003, the committee had received 419 reports from Member States and others. This includes 191 initial reports from Member States and five from others, 100 second reports from Member States and 2 from others and 71 third reports from Member States. It is important to note that to date, all Member States of the United Nations have submitted their initial reports.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">Nevertheless, by 30 September 2003, 48 States were late in submitting their reports. In accordance with the obligation of transparency in our work, the Committee has agreed that the Chairman will submit to the Security Council, no later than 31 October 2003, a list of States which have not yet submitted their reports on time as of that date. I therefore take this opportunity to reiterate to the representatives of States that are late that they should submit their reports as soon as possible. In any case, it should be remembered that the focus of the Counter-Terrorism Committee is on cooperation. We are therefore at the disposal of those States, not only to assist them in the submission of their reports but also to work with them in overcoming any problems responsible for the delay. I repeat that our team of experts will address any questions they deem it appropriate to address.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">With regard to the Committee's work, we will continue to follow closely the development of the flow of information exchanges with States through, among other means, letters and reports. Technical assistance will continue to be one of the main priorities of our work, as will ensuring adequate coordination of counter-terrorism efforts by international and regional organizations in combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">With regard to transparency, reference has already been made to progress in revamping the Committee's Web site. I am grateful for the work done in that regard by the Secretariat team, the Department of Public Information and the translation services of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">I conclude by noting that the chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee is aware of its responsibility to do all it can to ensure that the Committee works at an appropriate pace and functions effectively. Here I draw attention to paragraph 21 of the ninth work programme, which provides that the chairmanship shall submit to the Committee, for subsequent evaluation by the Security Council, a report on problems being encountered by States in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and on difficulties being experienced in the same regard under the present structure and functioning of the Counter-Terrorism Committee itself. The purpose of that report will be to identify major issues in order eventually to debate possible measures to be taken by both the Committee and the Security Council to solve them. All that will be done in order to ensure that the obligations contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> are met as fully and rapidly as possible by all Member States.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">On behalf of the Council, I thank Ambassador Arias for his comprehensive briefing and for his leadership of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">I would also like to make a procedural comment. There remain on the speakers' list the members of the Council and 19 non-members. Ambassador Pleuger has graciously agreed to postpone this afternoon's meeting to prepare the Afghanistan trip until 10.30 tomorrow morning, in order to free up time for us to continue this important discussion today. We will therefore break for lunch a little after 1 p.m. and then resume at 3 p.m. sharp to continue the discussion.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tidjani</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">The sad memory of those who died in Baghdad on 19 August 2003, in the United States on 11 September 2001, in Bali on 12 October 2002, and more recently in Morocco and many other parts of the world is a timely reminder of how vulnerable the world still is to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">This is a new type of terrorism in its methods, intolerance, wantonness and cowardice. It attacks all of society, inflicting indescribable suffering upon the peoples of the United Nations and plunging them into what Voltaire described as convulsions of anxiety -- to which one might add fear. It poses a serious threat to our most basic right: the right to life, a peaceful life, based on love, fraternity, justice and solidarity. Terrorism is therefore a matter of great concern, a threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">We have refused to give in to the diktat of terrorism. We have not given up; to the contrary, we have decided to react firmly and with perseverance. We have defined a mobilizing strategy that is daily being honed by the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> to confine this monster and fight more effectively against it.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The success of our collective struggle necessarily requires a firm commitment by all international actors and the strengthening of cooperation between all States, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, between States, international, regional and subregional organizations and civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">However, we will not achieve maximum collective security unless we develop a real policy to exchange information, experiences and assistance. My delegation believes that to be fundamental.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Against that backdrop, we believe that as a purely legal matter there is an urgent need for an overall international regulatory instrument to combat this evil. Although there is an impressive body of anti-terrorism conventions, there are gaps, due to the sectoral nature of current measures. On that precise point, I recall with regret that political differences are delaying consensus in the Sixth Committee on the drafting of an overall convention and a convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">It would be suicidal for the international community as a whole to continue to be passive spectators in the face of the risk to all humankind of the use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The effectiveness of our struggle also depends on improving the international environment by eliminating situations of injustice and poverty, which feed intolerance and hatred.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">Cameroon welcomes the largely positive work done by the Counter-Terrorism Committee. In its two-year existence it has received an impressive number of reports -- over 419; it has contributed greatly to consolidating consensus on the objectives and modalities of the struggle against terrorism, and to strengthening national anti-terrorism capacity as well as international cooperation in this sphere; and it is helping to promote existing conventions, where its effectiveness is illustrated by the growing number of States parties.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">The Counter-Terrorism Committee has become the best tool to coordinate dynamic cooperation between States and international and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">We owe all of that to the tenacity of a dedicated and effective team, energetically presided over by our colleague Ambassador Inocencio Arias, to whom I once again express our full confidence and convey our encouragement. The new programme covering the next 90 days, which he has just presented to us, is very ambitious in its objectives and pragmatic in its approach. My delegation fully supports that programme, and very much looks forward to the report that the Committee intends to submit regarding the main problems encountered by States in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We urge the Committee to submit periodically a report on the follow-up of the major recommendations of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">Finally, we are convinced that, after two years of existence, the Committee could benefit from a process of self-evaluation in order to look to the future in practical terms and to remain effective in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">The frequency of public debates on this topic should not mean that they should be seen as a commonplace ritual -- quite the opposite. They should enhance the awareness of almost all the peoples of the United Nations of the scope of this pernicious threat to our collective security.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">The delegation of Cameroon is therefore grateful to you, Mr. President, for having agreed to the convening of a public meeting on this question.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Maquieira</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">We are grateful to Ambassador Inocencio Arias for his exhaustive and useful presentation of the programme of work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee for the next 90 days and also, in more general terms, for his efficient and effective guidance of the work of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">I should like first of all to say that the Chilean delegation associates itself with the statement to be made shortly by the Permanent Representative of Peru on behalf of the Rio Group. For that reason, I will underscore only a few aspects of the programme of work outlined to us by Ambassador Arias -- those to which we attach the highest priority.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">It is vital that, as is stated in the programme of work, the principles of transparency, cooperation and equal treatment continue to be applied in the work of the Committee. The joint action of the international community in the struggle against terrorism requires this. This is an initiative that is the responsibility of us all. The Committee, as we have said in the past, is making practical and effective efforts to apply these principles case by case; this is certainly what makes consensus possible and what gives legitimacy to our action.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">We must move forward with practical measures in order effectively to confront the scourge of terrorism and to help all States to increase their capacity to prevent and react to actions of that nature.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Identifying the difficulties and the problems confronting States in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is a vital task. We take note of the report which will soon be presented in this regard by the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee to the Security Council, which is referred to in paragraph 21 of the programme of work. That report, we believe, will be very useful in planning the future work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">We welcome the fact that the Committee has continued to broaden its contacts and its cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations. The 6 March meeting with those entities was followed by one on 7 October last, held in Washington under the auspices of the Committee on Terrorism of the Organization of American States. That exchange will now continue, on 12 March 2004, in Vienna, with European organizations. All of this work of cooperation and collaboration should lead to more concrete operational results.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Technical assistance to those States that need it should also be among our constant concerns. We know that the Committee is taking a more active and dynamic role in this field; the Security Council should ensure that this approach continues to be followed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">In connection with the reports of States to the Committee, the figures given to us today by the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee are encouraging. All States have completed their initial reports. A large number of States have completed the second report, and an equally large number have already submitted the third report.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">Furthermore, the Committee has prepared a working paper on criteria for the preparation of draft letters addressed to those States that are beyond stage B, which, under the principles of transparency, cooperation and equal treatment, will allow for more dynamic assessments and contacts with States, which, ultimately, are the main protagonists of this joint effort.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">For that reason, above and beyond numbers, what we need to underscore is the ongoing relationship between the Committee and States, so that they can contribute together to the resolution of their problems in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is relevant to recall that effectiveness in the fight against terrorism, in the final analysis, depends on the responses of States and of international organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">At the global level, the threat of terrorism is one of the gravest and most urgent -- one that transcends all geographic and cultural boundaries. Unfortunately, this meeting is further clouded by the criminal attack in Baghdad which took the lives of many staff members of our Organization, including the outstanding Latin American Sergio Vieira de Mello. It is our duty to redouble our efforts to defeat that scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> was the beginning of unparalleled cooperation aimed at effectively confronting the global challenge of terrorism, and it made the Counter-Terrorism Committee the focal point in a process of cooperation that must involve every country of the world. We welcome the fact that the new programme of work continues to envisage the taking of practical measures to increase the ways and means that States have at their disposal in the fight against terrorism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tafrov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I should like, like previous speakers, warmly to thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Ambassador Inocencio Arias, for his presentation of the Committee's programme of work, as well as for the outstanding work he and his team in the Spanish Mission are doing in the context of the chairmanship of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">As an associated country of the European Union, Bulgaria aligns itself with the statement to be made shortly by the Permanent Representative of Italy on behalf of the European Union. I should like, however, to make a few comments in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">The Counter-Terrorism Committee remains at the heart of efforts to combat the scourge of terrorism. That devastating scourge poses a threat to all of humankind. We are pleased that, during the past three months, the Committee has continued to work actively to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">We are grateful to Ambassador Arias, as I have just said, and to the team of experts of the Secretariat for their outstanding work. I should like also to add that my delegation fully agrees with the assessment of the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee just given by Ambassador Arias in his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">During the past period, positive results were achieved in terms of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In this connection, we welcome the fact that all Member States have already submitted their initial reports. We should take note also of the fact that ongoing efforts have been made to ensure maximum transparency in the work of the Committee and to ensure progress in the area of cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">By the same token, it should be noted that a great deal remains to be done with respect to the full implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">In this connection, I should like briefly to emphasize a few trends in the work of the Committee to which my delegation attaches particular attention.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">First, we are aware that consideration of the report has been slowed down because of the complexity of the evaluation criteria used in stage B. Furthermore, we are concerned that 48 States have still not complied with the timetable laid down for the submission of reports. In this connection, we share the view that technical assistance should be facilitated for those countries requiring it. We welcome all of the efforts made to go from stage A to stage B, which would focus on the practical application of universally adopted counter-terrorism measures.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">Secondly, my delegation attaches great importance to cooperation between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and regional and subregional organizations. Bulgaria supports strengthening contact and cooperation to combat terrorism between the Committee and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">The priorities of the Bulgarian chairmanship of the OSCE in 2004 will include giving final concrete form to cooperation with the Committee and with specialized agencies of the United Nations system. We hope that the joint meeting of the Committee and the OSCE, which is planned for 12 March in Vienna, will make a useful contribution to this. The seminars and other joint initiatives of the European Union and the OSCE make a valuable contribution to drawing up the necessary legislation and to strengthening the capacity and expertise of States in such areas as banking, customs and border control. We look forward to the seminar to take place on 7 November under the aegis of the Italian presidency of the European Union and of the European Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa11">Thirdly, my country reiterates its position that the struggle against terrorism should be waged with strict respect for human rights. Any action, whether at the national, regional or subregional levels, must be in accordance with the norms of international law and international humanitarian law. Terrorists should not have the slightest pretext for their hateful acts.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa12">Fourthly, we share the concern of numerous delegations that the Committee's work should be given a more practical orientation. In this context, we support the Committee Chairman's idea of submitting to the Council a report on the difficulties encountered by Member States -- and himself -- in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sow</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Permit me to express my delegation's appreciation to Ambassador Inocencio F. Arias, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, for his complete and detailed report on the Committee's work. We also congratulate him on his efficiency and dynamism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">This meeting gives us another opportunity to evaluate what has been accomplished in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Through its structure, working methods and mode of operation, the Counter-Terrorism Committee has contributed to a better understanding of terrorism and inspired trust among the different parties involved with a view to greater cooperation for the eradication of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The submission of initial reports by 191 Member States and five other entities, of second reports by 150 Member States and two other entities, and of third reports by 71 Member States indicates in every respect the will and determination of the various actors to strengthen this cooperation. Nonetheless, we urge those States that have not met the deadline for submitting their reports to submit those reports as soon as possible. In this regard, we support the proposals of the Committee in paragraph 5 of its current programme of work (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-995.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/995</a>). We encourage the Committee to disseminate information on the progress made by States as well as on solutions to strengthen their ability to meet their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">My delegation attaches special importance to the working paper entitled "Criteria for the preparation of draft letters to States beyond Stage A". This suggests that the consideration of the passage of a State from one stage to another should be conducted carefully, in order to provide concrete responses to Member States' problems in implementing the resolution. For this purpose, the suggestions in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the programme of work deserve our fullest attention.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The question of assistance remains fundamental for strengthening the capacities of certain actors in the fight against terrorism. In this regard, we welcome the Committee's development of the Directory of Counter-Terrorism Information and Sources of Assistance. We appeal to the donor community to give greater attention to this question because the consequences of terrorism, which strikes where the international system is weakest, are unforeseeable. To this end, my delegation encourages increased cooperation between Member States and the Committee, which in our view should be the central mechanism for coordinating assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">We welcome the transparency with which the Committee is doing its work, especially through the regular information given to Member States and close contacts between experts and the institutions and bodies of the United Nations system. We appreciate the provision of a Web site, which is becoming an essential source of information regarding all questions relating to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">In the framework of cooperation between the Committee on the one hand and international, regional and subregional organizations on the other, we are delighted by the work under way to implement the recommendations resulting from the meeting of 6 March 2003. My delegation believes that the Council should be informed of the conclusions of meetings of international, regional and subregional institutions and organizations, and of the results of contacts between the Committee and those institutions and organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">While underscoring the importance of coordination between the different entities of the United Nations system, we emphasize once again the need to strengthen cooperation between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. These Committees have focal points of interest that, to a great extent, converge, just as they do with those of the Ad Hoc Committee established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/210</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">As for the Committee's future activities, my delegation believes that the report that the Chairman intends to submit will shed further light on the difficulties confronting certain Member States in their implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and on the proposed solutions, as well as the prospects for a better functioning of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">The road leading to the eradication of terrorism is long and full of obstacles. The results achieved thus far by the international community indicate our shared determination to eliminate terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">The Committee, through its work, has in many respects made clear the interdependence of terrorism and other forms of organized crime, and the existence of a global structure to combat terrorism. The entry into force on 29 September this year of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime was undoubtedly another victory for our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa13">The progress made by the Committee testifies not only to its determination to fulfil its responsibilities effectively and expeditiously, but also to the political will of States to shoulder their obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa14">My delegation welcomes the Council's renewed confidence in the Chairman and the entire Committee with the continuation of their mandates, and we assure them of our full support. We are convinced that today's debate will give rise to initiatives that can enrich our collective thinking in the fight against terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I should like to begin by complimenting Ambassador Arias on his stewardship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) over the past six months. His hard work, his direction and his unstinting efforts have been much appreciated by my delegation. The United Kingdom fully endorses the proposed programme of work and the principles that guide it.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">I should like to associate myself with the statement to be made later by the representative of Italy on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">I should like to make four specific points on the CTC and its work. First, sadly, the threat from terrorism has not diminished or eroded. If the Committee is to maintain and increase its successes in reinforcing the capacity of Member States to tackle and overcome terrorism, it must be strengthened further and given the expertise and the remit to do that effectively. For that reason, I very much welcome the Chairman's proposal to submit to the Committee and to the Council a report on the problems and difficulties and, I very much hope, containing proposed solutions. The United Kingdom is prepared to assist the Committee in whatever way we can to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Secondly, Ambassador Arias has rightly identified technical assistance as a priority; it is vital to helping States implement the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. There are numerous examples of excellent initiatives in this area; the Committee has played a key role in the facilitation of assistance. But, just as the Committee needs to adapt to maintain its effectiveness, so, too, do the methods used to deliver the assistance where it is needed most. Better coordination, more contact with donors and recipient States, and intensive follow-up action are all necessary to ensure that assistance has been properly delivered and will help achieve the objective: quite clearly, to help States implement the measures called for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The CTC and its experts must be given the support, the guidance and the resources that will enable them to do that important work properly.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Thirdly, much has been said about the value of cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations in combating terrorism. The CTC meeting in Washington last week, co-hosted by the Organization of American States, demonstrated that yet again. A global network is emerging to support and underpin the work which individuals, States, organizations and the CTC itself are doing in order to develop counter-terrorism capacity. We should seek to maintain, strengthen and focus that network in every way possible. The meetings with subregional and regional organizations are key to that, and the Committee should continue its work to gain as much as possible from this process.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">Lastly, an important element in the fight against terrorism is the ratification and implementation of the 12 universal conventions. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> calls upon States to become parties to those conventions as soon as possible. Much has been done to encourage that, with some very good results. But we know, too, that there are far too many gaps and that the efforts need to be strengthened further. So the United Kingdom very much welcomes the Committee's proposal to examine the reasons for low levels of ratification and, again, to come forward with concrete, practical suggestions as to how we can improve that situation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">The Security Council has many urgent and important subjects on its agenda. But, as far as the United Kingdom is concerned, none is more vital than the need to challenge, to combat and to defeat the scourge of terrorism. Therefore, our support for the CTC remains total. Much good progress has been made so far, but terrorism remains a serious and grave threat. Our responsibility, as the Council, is to see how we can build on the achievements in order to strengthen the interventions that we need to make globally so that all of us can better face the challenges which we confront. The work programme that Ambassador Arias has set out is a real contribution to that effort.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">First of all, we should like to thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Arias, for his report and for the good work that he is producing in the CTC. The fight against terrorism within the broadest possible international coalition remains one of Germany's most important policy objectives. While we fully subscribe to the forthcoming statement by the presidency of the European Union, we should like to highlight the following points.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The Counter-Terrorism Committee has done impressive work, and its Chairman, its experts and the United Nations Secretariat deserve our recognition and thanks. We support the CTC's new work programme. We appreciate the ever-increasing links that the CTC has established with international organizations and specialized agencies, as demonstrated recently during the meeting in Washington organized jointly by the CTC and the Organization of American States. Most important of all, the CTC has established a continuous dialogue with all United Nations Member States on key counter-terrorism issues under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1456 (2003)</a>. The quality and intensity of that dialogue are unprecedented in United Nations history, and are an asset that we can build on.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Under the new work programme, the Chairman plans to submit a report on the strengths and weaknesses of international counter-terrorism efforts. Such an evaluation could help us in further intensifying cooperation by adopting a more operative approach. For instance, one step forward might be for CTC experts to form joint teams with members of specialized international organizations and actively assist countries in key areas of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1456 (2003)</a>, such as professionalizing their financial control, border protection, weapons control and law enforcement sectors. Another idea might be to consider the creation of a high-level authority -- such as a United Nations counter-terrorism coordinator -- who might help to better focus and streamline enhanced United Nations activities to counter terrorism in all its aspects and on a global basis. Discussing such steps or similar ideas more thoroughly would be in line with many suggestions voiced during the General Assembly's recent general debate calling for the strengthening of United Nations counter-terrorism organs.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">We are not here to offer ready-made solutions. But my Government is convinced that the credibility of United Nations counter-terrorism efforts depends on their ability to make a difference on the ground. It seems worthwhile to reflect on new ways to strengthen the United Nations -- including the CTC -- in order to fight terrorism even more effectively. We think the time has come to increase the effectiveness of United Nations and CTC action, within existing means and, of course, while respecting the framework of the United Nations Charter and international law.</p>
