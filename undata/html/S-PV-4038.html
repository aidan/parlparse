	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General, <a href="../pdf/S-1999-862.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/862</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">The first speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Portugal, and I now call on him.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Monteiro</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Mr. President, I should like first to express my appreciation to you personally and to all the other members of the Council for making possible our presence here today.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Portugal fully subscribes to the statement that will be made later by the presidency of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The question of East Timor has faced impressive developments in the past 17 years, since the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to initiate consultations with all parties directly involved to find a solution to this problem. The cornerstone of the process now under way in East Timor are the 5 May Agreements, recently concluded through the good offices of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Under the Agreements, the Secretary-General is requested to consult the East Timorese on the status of their territory through a direct, secret and universal ballot. Let me stress that this is, in fact, the achievement of what the international community and Portugal in particular have for so long sought for East Timor: that its people be given the right to choose their own future.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">East Timor may become a "success story" for the United Nations, provided all actors comply with their obligations. I would like to commend the personal commitment of the Secretary-General and the engagement of Ambassador Marker and his team in finding a political solution. Their efforts show that even the most difficult problems can be overcome if there is a serious and honest political will to do so.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">I must also point out the remarkable work that is being accomplished by the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) and by the team headed by Mr. Ian Martin in the implementation of such a solution. Their task is not an easy one, yet they have shown extreme professionalism and diligence in carrying it out impartially and effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The vote that is about to take place in East Timor is a historical event made possible by the efforts and resources of the United Nations and the many countries that are supporting it. But it is basically the result of the struggle of the Timorese themselves, who have never given up the right to choose their future. It is only regrettable that they may not be able to do so under all required conditions for such an important decision.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">In fact, the prevailing environment of intimidation, violence and insecurity in the territory is hampering the very aim of the 5 May Agreements, which is the holding of a free and fair ballot. I will not go through the whole list of incidents that occurred with a repetitive pattern in East Timor. The international community is fully aware of them. But I have to express my Government's grave concern that on the eve of the consultation there are still armed militias active in the territory and that most of their criminal actions are not being properly investigated or punished.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">After the success of the registration process, we were expecting to see a broad and free campaign in which both parties would peacefully present their views, enabling people to make their choices free from any pressure. Instead, we have witnessed an environment of increased fear and a situation where many persons in favour of independence have been either prevented from participating in the campaign or subjected to physical violence and intimidation. Several international personnel, and even UNAMET staff, have experienced this atmosphere of threat and insecurity.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">I seize this opportunity to appeal once again to the Indonesian authorities to make an additional effort. On the voting day all conditions should be in place to ensure that the popular consultation is carried out in a fair and peaceful way, in an atmosphere free of intimidation, violence or interference from any side. In this regard I underline -- as is recalled in the resolution that will be adopted by the Council -- that under the Agreements of 5 May it is the sole responsibility of Indonesia to maintain peace and security in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">The events that took place in East Timor yesterday are evidence that the measures taken so far are completely inadequate and insufficient. It is inadmissible that so close to the consultation we are witnessing such an increase in violence and even loss of human lives. We hope that Indonesia gives an answer to the statements issued yesterday by the Security Council and by the Secretary-General himself strongly condemning these events and demanding that the Indonesian authorities take concrete steps to stop and revert this situation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">Through the Portuguese Observation Mission of the Popular Consultation in East Timor, my Government has continuously reported to UNAMET and to the Indonesian Task Force on the Implementation of the Popular Consultation the incidents it has witnessed. Also, we have always discussed these issues on a regular basis here in New York with the United Nations and the Indonesian representatives. The excellent cooperation that has always prevailed in these contacts, and that I would like to emphasize, unfortunately has not always found translation on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">I would now like to turn to the future with renewed hope. We welcome the approval by the Security Council of a resolution that will allow the United Nations to maintain an adequate presence in East Timor after the ballot and to prepare the implementation of its result.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">As you are aware, the trilateral dialogue between the United Nations, Portugal and Indonesia has continued to find the necessary arrangements to ensure a smooth transition in East Timor, whatever the result of the consultation might be. The senior officials meeting held in Jakarta and the one that took place just yesterday in Lisbon have allowed us to further our cooperation and to discuss ways to proceed from the consultation onwards. We are pleased to point out that the Indonesian authorities have reiterated their commitment to the process after the ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">When referring to the future of East Timor, the role of the East Timorese and the progress they have made towards national reconciliation have to be highlighted. Overcoming their differences and living together peacefully will be the biggest challenge facing them after the consultation. We vividly welcome the agreement by the East Timorese leaders, in the meetings sponsored by the United Nations, to appoint their representatives to the East Timorese Consultative Commission and to have both the head of the pro-integration movement and the head of the National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT), Xanana Gusmão, attend the first meeting of that council. Their full participation in such an historic meeting, to take place in Dili the day immediately after the ballot, will send an important signal of confidence in the future of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">Bearing in mind his role in promoting peace and reconciliation, which is recognized by all parties and the international community, Xanana Gusmão's presence in Dili will surely have a stabilizing effect. Portugal therefore reiterates its appeal to the Indonesian Government to release Xanana Gusmão, as well as all other East Timorese political prisoners, and allow access to the territory by CNRT leaders who reside abroad.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">Portugal stands ready to assist the transition in East Timor and the implementation of the result of the consultation, whether that is the acceptance or rejection of the autonomy proposal. We will do our utmost to support the efforts of the East Timorese in building their future as the result of a free decision.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">My Government will continue also to work with Indonesia and the East Timorese, within the framework of the United Nations, towards a successful transition. We will spare no efforts to make sure that East Timor is finally on the path of peace and development. East Timor is proof, after all, that just causes can win.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Portugal for his statement and for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Indonesia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wibisono</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I personally would like to extend my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency for the month of August. We have every confidence that under your wise and able guidance, the issues before the Council will be brought to a successful conclusion. Allow me also to extend felicitations to your distinguished predecessor, Ambassador Hasmy Agam, Permanent Representative of Malaysia, for his skilful stewardship of the Council's activities last month.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">Let me begin by stressing that the East Timor question has reached the current stage due to the series of bold and far-reaching initiatives by the Indonesian Government under President B. J. Habibie. First, on 9 June 1998 the Indonesian Government formally expressed its readiness to grant a special status to East Timor with wide-ranging autonomy. Then, on 27 January 1999 it offered to part ways with East Timor in a peaceful, orderly and honourable manner if autonomy is rejected. It was these initiatives that provided positive impetus to the talks that have been held under United Nations auspices since 1983, culminating in the 5 May Agreements. As a consequence of these initiatives, we will witness the historic event in three days time -- the popular consultation in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">This meeting of the Security Council is being convened against the backdrop of the approaching crucial interim phase. It constitutes an important period between the finalization of the holding of the popular consultation and the commencement of the implementation of its outcome. It is therefore most relevant and appropriate to recall the positive developments leading up to the present time.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">For its part, the Government of Indonesia is determined and committed to shoulder its responsibilities in accordance with the 5 May Agreements. In particular, it has exerted serious efforts to ensure that the security situation is conducive to holding a free, fair and peaceful popular consultation. This has been evident in the successful conclusion of the registration process held from 16 July until 6 August 1999, thereby completing the first operational phase of the popular consultation. It is pertinent to note that this was conducted in an orderly manner, as acknowledged by the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), which registered over 451,792 East Timorese at 200 registration centres. My delegation is pleased to report that to participate in this historic process, eligible voters travelled in large numbers without any impediments to the nearest location in order to register. Likewise, it was gratifying that internally displaced persons in East Timor and West Timor were able to register.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Credit for the achievement of these endeavours is largely due to the flourishing cooperation existing between the UNAMET and the Indonesian Task Force for the Implementation of the Popular Consultation in East Timor, the Provisional Government of East Timor, the Social Department and the Health Department, as well as the police, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">As we approach the final days leading to 30 August 1999, the situation on the ground has recorded remarkable improvements. As a reflection of its seriousness to enhance law and order in East Timor at this critical juncture, the Indonesian Government has deployed some 8,000 police personnel to assure peace both before the popular consultation and after its conclusion. This high ratio of 1 policeman per 100 East Timorese attests to the sincere willingness of the Indonesian authorities to commit large numbers of law enforcement officials, as well as resources, to maintain a tranquil and secure environment. It is also expected that the number of police will be increased if circumstances warrant. While it is indeed unfortunate that some incidents have occurred in certain places, attributable to the actions of both sides, in each instance the Indonesian police acted promptly to isolate them while carrying out the necessary investigations. The allegations of impunity with respect to the Maliana and Liquica incidents have been dealt with by taking stern judicial measures against the perpetrators. Concerning the most recent incident, which took place on 26 August 1999, in Dili, to which the representative of Portugal referred, my delegation regrets the demise of four persons, two supporters of the pro-integration group and two from the pro-independence group. An investigation into the causes of this incident by the police is still under way. Therefore, the impartiality of the police in investigating all cases referred to them by UNAMET, whether committed by pro-integration or by pro-independence groups, has instilled trust in their professional abilities.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Following a relatively peaceful and orderly period of campaigning that began on 14 August 1999, it is indeed deeply regrettable that a crisis erupted yesterday when members of the pro-independence group carried out acts of provocation against the supporters of pro-integration. What actually occurred was that pro-independence supporters pelted pro-integration members with rocks. Thereafter, tensions were heightened when two pro-integration supporters, including a former district assemblyman, were kidnapped and killed by members of the pro-independence group. Subsequently, pro-integration members counter-attacked the office of the CNRT in Dili, causing the deaths of two pro-independence supporters. The police immediately launched an investigation into the incident, and the results are being awaited. In the final days leading up to the popular consultations, my delegation sincerely hopes that all sides will exercise restraint and contribute to a calm and tranquil environment.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The adoption of the code of conduct for the campaign by UNAMET and by East Timorese figures, in line with the 5 May 1999 Agreements, to ensure an orderly campaign, is also an encouraging factor. In view of the fact that the campaign is being conducted in the presence of a large number of observers from around the world -- be they parliamentarians, non-governmental organizations or others -- provides a degree of guarantee that the process is conducted in a secure and safe environment.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">Similarly, the steps towards the implementation of the code of conduct on security by the Commission on Peace and Stability to ensure disarmament by the contending factions is a welcome development. It is pertinent to note that more than 600 weapons have been turned over under the Commission's supervision and witnessed by UNAMET. Furthermore, the status-of-mission agreement has been signed by the Government of Indonesia and came into effect on 23 August 1999, containing provisions, <i>inter alia</i>, on granting various privileges and immunities and providing the necessary facilities for the functioning of UNAMET, as well on the need for UNAMET to carry out its duties while complying with the laws and regulations of Indonesia and refraining from activities that are incompatible with its duties.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">Another development that the Government of Indonesia welcomes wholeheartedly is the convening by the United Nations of a meeting between the leaders of the East Timorese groups in Jakarta on 22 August 1999. Among the positive results reached at that meeting was that each side submitted 10 names of those who would be participating in the Consultative Commission which they themselves had agreed to establish. It is hoped that at the next meeting, both sides will come to an agreement on a common position with regard to the cantonment of their personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">My delegation welcomes all these notable developments as reflections of concrete progress achieved in accordance with the planned schedule, and also, despite the constraints of time, of the determination of all sides to fulfil their responsibilities and obligations. In this context, my delegation recalls that during the holding of national elections in June 1999, many international observers expressed serious concern that such an event was unlikely to take place at all in view of the fact that the elections were held against the backdrop of the May incident. In spite of this, the ardent desire and unswerving commitment of the Government of Indonesia to lay the viable underpinnings of a democratic process prevailed. The elections of 7 June 1999 were widely considered by the international community to be the most democratic exercise ever held in Indonesia since 1955. Notwithstanding the erroneous perceptions held by some and the over-dramatization of the situation, the Indonesian national election was brought to a smooth and effective conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">Bearing in mind this most recent experience in our nation's history, it is imperative that perceptions be accordingly adjusted and over-dramatization avoided if the popular consultation in East Timor is to be successfully implemented. These aspects were deemed essential by my delegation by having promoted a conducive atmosphere for the campaign period that was completed today. This campaign has been of paramount importance to the people of East Timor, for it offered them historic political choices while placing on their leaders the need to demonstrate a high level of wisdom and sagacity. It affords a unique opportunity to bring to an end differences between the pro-integration and the pro-independence groups, thereby opening up a new era in their lives, which is rendered even more essential as they stand at the threshold of the next millennium. What is needed now is deep reflection on the choices to be made in the next few days that will profoundly impact their lives forever. At this juncture, it is also important for the people of East Timor to focus on tangible issues that could affect their future -- not only politically but also economically, socially and culturally. And this historic event will finally fulfil their deep aspirations and fervent desires.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">It would therefore be most helpful to the East Timorese, as well as to Indonesia and the international community, if distortion of facts were avoided. It is unfortunate that misperceptions continue to be cultivated, as though the majority of East Timorese were still living under colonial domination and, given the chance, they would opt to part ways with Indonesia. On the other hand, East Timorese that have expressed their wish to remain part of Indonesia are immediately and arbitrarily condemned as "military-backed militias". This is completely contrary to the practices of democracy, where tolerance as well as freedom of opinion and expression are of paramount importance. The fact remains that there are two groups in East Timor, and neither could or should be dismissed out of hand.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">It is our earnest hope that the cooling-off period of 28 and 29 August 1999 will have a salutary impact in bringing about an atmosphere of tranquillity, which is an essential prerequisite for the holding of the popular consultation, on 30 August 1999. This is a critical moment for all concerned parties to demonstrate a sense of impartiality in order to earn the trust and confidence of the East Timorese in the popular consultation, and during this entire process of popular consultation should necessarily include a degree of transparency.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa15">The adoption of the draft resolution before the Council today will have a significant impact on the interim phase of the popular consultation. In this regard, my delegation would like to acknowledge the report of the Secretary-General and the recommendations contained therein, as reflected in the draft resolution. Given its cooperation and pragmatism during this entire process, commencing with its initiative that led to the 5 May 1999 Agreements, Indonesia has agreed to the expansion of various components of UNAMET, based upon the principle of equitable geographical representation, in the interim phase, in order to maintain its international and impartial character. Indonesia has shown yet again its flexibility, especially in its acceptance of a police component of 410 and of another 50 personnel to recruit and train a new East Timorese police force. Likewise, Indonesia has consented to increase the military component up to 300 personnel. These United Nations military liaison officers will continue to undertake military liaison functions with the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) and to be involved in the work of the East Timorese bodies established to promote peace, stability and reconciliation, as well as to provide advice to the Special Representative for the East Timor popular consultation on security matters, pursuant to the implementation of the 5 May Agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa16">With regard to UNAMET, my delegation notes its serious efforts in discharging its tasks, as mandated by the Council. We should therefore like to express our appreciation to UNAMET and its personnel, who have demonstrated the highest standard of impartiality. However, from our observations in the field, other individuals from among UNAMET personnel are not adhering to this principle while carrying out their duties, thus adversely affecting the process of popular consultation on the ground. In view of this, my delegation expresses its reservations concerning the sixth preambular paragraph of the draft resolution "commending UNAMET for the impartial and effective implementation of its mandate".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa17">Finally, in the search for a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor under the tripartite dialogue, as well as the implementation of the 5 May 1999 Agreements, Indonesia's commitment has been unwavering. Over the past 16 years, despite the obstacles and challenges strewn along the way, Indonesia has held steadfast to its position that if it stayed on the appropriate path, such a solution to this long-standing issue would be attained. It is in this spirit of optimism and hope that we face the popular consultation on 30 August 1999. My delegation therefore hopes that the draft resolution before us is a step in that direction.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa18">Last but not least, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to express my Government's sincere appreciation to those countries and personnel that have contributed civilian police and military personnel to UNAMET, thereby enabling it to undertake this difficult yet very important responsibility.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Indonesia for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Australia. I invite her to take a seat at the Council table and to make her statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Wensley</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">I welcome the opportunity to address the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">The adoption by the Council today, in a few moments, of this draft resolution on East Timor represents a further important step in putting into effect the historic 5 May 1999 New York Agreements between the Governments of Indonesia and Portugal and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">As a neighbour and a country with historical ties to East Timor, Australia welcomed the 5 May Agreements. We said at the time, however, that this was the start of what would be a difficult process. In the time since the signature of the Agreements, a great deal of hard work has been done by all the parties concerned, and while the historic ballot is now only days away, a considerable distance still remains to be travelled.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">We congratulate the parties and the Secretary-General for their efforts and for the spirit of accommodation and compromise with which some very sensitive and difficult issues have been approached. Particular credit is due to the Secretary-General's Personal Representative, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker, whose patient and skilful diplomacy has played a major role in the success of the United Nations efforts so far.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Australia supports fully the steps taken in today's draft resolution to restructure the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) in the interim phase following the 30 August consultation. The draft resolution includes, as the Council knows, an increase in the civilian police component of UNAMET to 460, and of military liaison officers from 50 to up to 300. It envisages assistance in training an East Timorese police force, whether the outcome of the 30 August consultation is to accept or to reject the autonomy package offered by the Government of Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">This draft resolution will make it possible for the United Nations to continue to assist during the crucial next phase -- between the consultation and the implementation of its result -- in helping resolve the East Timor issue. Key United Nations responsibilities in the post-consultation period -- again, irrespective of the result -- will be to build confidence, to support stability and to reassure all groups, including those who are disappointed by the results.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">Australia will continue to give its full support to UNAMET during this crucial period. Our support for UNAMET goes beyond the rhetorical. We have made a significant contribution to the trust fund. We are providing substantial in-kind assistance, including the provision of electoral assistance, transport equipment, training and administrative facilities in the Australian city of Darwin. We are also contributing civilian police to the civilian police contingent and military personnel to the military liaison contingent. We welcome, and we have worked energetically to encourage, the participation of a wide range of Member States in UNAMET.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">Australia is very conscious that a difficult time lies ahead, in the few days remaining to the ballot, on the ballot day itself and in the period after the vote. But we share the hope that the ballot will be conducted peacefully. However, the security situation in East Timor remains tense: there have been continuing violence and intimidation in many parts of East Timor. The violent clashes which occurred in Dili on 26 August, which were referred to by my colleagues from Indonesia and Portugal, are a matter of serious concern, and the Australian Government forcefully condemns such acts. We, like the United Nations and other members of the international community, believe it essential that the ballot be allowed to proceed and that it not be derailed by the actions of those whose only response to this historic moment is to resort to violence.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">We have attached the highest importance to creating an environment that is secure and free from violence and intimidation. This is a precondition for a free and fair ballot on 30 August, and we have urged -- and will continue to urge -- all parties to take all necessary steps to create this environment. In recent days, the Australian Government has, at the very highest levels, again emphasized to the Government of Indonesia that ensuring security in East Timor remains its responsibility. My Government has urged the Government of Indonesia on many occasions to take the necessary steps to restore law and order in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">Under the 5 May New York Agreements, the Government of Indonesia remains responsible for security after the ballot, whatever the result. We recall and we welcome assurances from the highest levels of the Indonesian Government of its undertakings to uphold its international commitments.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">The popular consultation on 30 August represents a historic opportunity for the East Timorese people to express a view on their constitutional future. At the same time, there is a pressing need for reconciliation between the factions in East Timor if the process that was embarked upon on here on 5 May is to lead to a peaceful and lasting resolution of the East Timor conflict. Australia urges all parties to make the utmost efforts towards this end, and we remain committed to assisting all genuine reconciliation efforts among the East Timorese. In particular, we, like others, have been greatly encouraged by the steps taken in recent days to establish an East Timorese consultative commission, with representation from both pro-integration and pro-independence leaders. The commission, we believe, offers hope that East Timorese of different views will see the need to accommodate their interests peacefully.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">We also very much welcome reports received overnight that the Government of Indonesia has decided to release Xanana Gusmão. Like the United Nations, Australia has consistently said that Xanana Gusmão should be allowed to return to East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa13">Australia is strongly committed to supporting the implementation of the 5 May Agreements and the consultation process conducted by UNAMET. We recognize the historic challenge that this poses for the Government of Indonesia and for the international community. We are pleased to support it and to contribute as best we can to ensuring its success.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Finland. I invite her to take a seat at the Council table and to make her statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Rasi</span> <span class="nation">Finland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">It is a great pleasure for me to address the Security Council today under your presidency, Mr. President.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union countries.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">On 5 May 1999 the Agreements on East Timor were signed in New York. They will lead to a popular consultation of the East Timorese people on whether they will accept the proposed constitutional framework for autonomy or reject it and opt for independence. The European Union warmly welcomed the signing of these Agreements in its declaration of 7 May 1999. The Union believes that these Agreements constitute a major breakthrough in the search for a settlement for East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">Since 5 May 1999, substantial work has been done towards the implementation of these Agreements. On 11 June 1999, the Security Council established the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) to organize and conduct a popular consultation, scheduled for 30 August 1999. Today the Security Council will decide to extend the mandate of UNAMET until 30 November 1999 and to adjust the tasks and structure of the Mission for the needs of the interim phase between the conclusion of the popular consultation and the start of the implementation of its results.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">The European Union reiterates its strong support for the consultation process, which will enable the East Timorese people to express their views as to the future of the territory. In this context, I would like to mention that the European Union is sending a number of observers to the consultation and that the Presidency has appointed the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland as its personal representative for these matters.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">The European Union underlines its full support for the work of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative; and the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) in pursuing the process and would like to congratulate it for a successful registration of voters. The European Union urges the Government of Indonesia and the local authorities in East Timor to cooperate fully with the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">The European Union continues to be deeply concerned about the situation in the territory, in particular the intimidatory behaviour of the pro-integration militias, which numerous independent observers have linked to elements of the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI). We urge the Indonesian authorities to live up to their obligations under the New York tripartite Agreement and to ensure that the necessary security conditions will be there before, during and after the ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">The European Union therefore notes with profound concern that acts of political violence continue to be perpetrated in East Timor, in direct contravention of the spirit and the letter of the Agreements. We are particularly disturbed by the violence in Dili on 26 August 1999. The European Union recalls its position that the Indonesian Government remains obliged to maintain and preserve security, stability and public order in East Timor, to disarm militias and to hold accountable the perpetrators of the killings, whether they are advocates of autonomy or of independence.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">The European Union urges the Government of Indonesia to establish a secure environment devoid of violence and all forms of intimidation, which is a prerequisite for the holding of a free and fair ballot in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">A point of grave concern to the European Union is the future of Xanana Gusmão. It is the view of the European Union that his immediate release, as well as that of all East Timorese political prisoners, is an essential factor for the success of the consultation process. Furthermore, given that Mr. Gusmão is a member of the Commission on Peace and Stability, it is essential that he should be allowed to participate fully in its activities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">The European Union welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-General to create an East Timorese consultative commission and hopes that all parties will be able to engage in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa12">The European Union has observed with great respect the enormous efforts undertaken by the Indonesian people and its Government to organize free and fair elections in Indonesia. The European Union trusts the Indonesian Government and local authorities will also honour their commitments towards the implementation of the New York Agreements. The European Union remains fully committed to supporting them. The European Union also remains fully committed to supporting the United Nations in this very difficult mission on the question of East Timor.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Finland for her kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of New Zealand. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Powles</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">It is a particular pleasure to address a Security Council over which you, Sir, are presiding.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">New Zealand is pleased to join with other Members involved in the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) in welcoming the proposed decision of the Security Council today on the interim phase of its operation in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">We are approaching the day of the direct ballot. The campaign period concludes today, leaving a two-day cooling-off period. On Monday, the people of East Timor will have the opportunity to determine their own future. They have shown, by their determination to register for the ballot in overwhelming numbers, that they want to have this say.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">For the boldness of vision in creating this opportunity, President Habibie's Government can take great credit. The United Nations Mission can also take great credit. It had to move quickly, in difficult circumstances, to establish a presence in East Timor and to prepare for the popular consultation. This was UNAMET's primary task, as mandated under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1246(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1246 (1999)</a> of 11 June 1999. New Zealand is confident that UNAMET will continue to carry out its responsibilities in managing the consultation on 30 August capably, efficiently and with absolute impartiality.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">It is right that the Security Council should now look to the next stages of this important process. There can be no cooling-off period for UNAMET. Today's decision will provide an assurance to the people of East Timor that the United Nations is committed to their future; it underlines the continuing commitment of the United Nations to the process, until the Indonesian Parliament is able to give effect to the outcome of the popular consultation, whatever that may be.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">During the interim phase immediately following the ballot, UNAMET will face a range of different tasks. Its structure has to reflect these new demands, and New Zealand welcomes the revised composition of UNAMET set out in the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">New Zealand has given steadfast encouragement to the United Nations tripartite negotiations that produced the 5 May Agreement. We have been an early contributor to UNAMET and will increase our support in the second phase of the operation that the Security Council will approve today. We will be doubling the number of New Zealand Defence Force military liaison officers from 5 to 10 and increasing the number of civilian police officers from 10 to 15.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">The future of East Timor now lies with the East Timorese. There should be no winners and losers. As the draft resolution highlights, the United Nations needs to continue to reassure all groups that they will have a role to play in the political life of East Timor after the ballot. Work towards reconciliation and the establishment of confidence between all groups will be critical over this interim phase.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">In this regard, it will be very important to get clear, public and ongoing commitments from leaders of both the pro-autonomy and pro-independence sides to respect the outcome -- in all parts of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">The Government of Indonesia has a key role to play in this process, not least because of its continuing responsibility to maintain peace and security in East Timor. New Zealand is confident that Indonesia has the capacity to ensure that the ballot is conducted in a safe and secure environment. We believe that it is possible for both sides to accept the ballot result without resorting to violence. Those who are predicting bloodshed also have in their power the ability to prevent such an outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">But there is no hiding the fact that the requirement for ensuring a secure environment devoid of violence or other forms of intimidation, as a prerequisite for the holding of a free and fair ballot, has not been fully met. As ballot day approaches, there has been an upsurge in violence by pro-autonomy militia and a disturbing number of attacks directed specifically at UNAMET staff, facilities and residences.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa12">Members will know of New Zealand's initiative in bringing to this Council some years ago our concerns about the safety of United Nations personnel. These concerns have not diminished. We urge Indonesia, particularly the military authorities in Indonesia, to redouble their efforts to ensure security and calm in the run-up to the ballot and the period thereafter.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa13">New Zealand's views on the importance of adequately funding Security Council-mandated operations, such as UNAMET, are also familiar. The United Nations capacity to bring peace and security to areas of conflict around the world is significantly influenced by decisions on funding. As a founding Member of the United Nations, we recognized from the outset the importance of Article 17 of the Charter and the obligations flowing from it. Ad hoc voluntary arrangements can be no credible or reliable substitute.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa14">Finally, we would like to reiterate our appreciation and respect for the manner in which the Secretary-General and his officials are carrying out their responsibilities on the question of East Timor.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of New Zealand for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of the Republic of Korea in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk03-pa01">I invite the representative of the Republic of Korea to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lee</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa01">At the outset, Mr. President, I would like to commend your decision to allow interested non-members of the Council to express their views on the situation in Timor, one of the most important agenda items before the Security Council and one that requires urgent action. It is our firm belief that hearing the views of Member States in an open forum not only promotes the transparency of the work of the Council in general but also helps make the decision-making process of the Council on operations requiring Member States' involvement and contributions -- the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) in particular -- more democratic and legitimate.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa02">The Republic of Korea, as a peace-loving Asian country, has long attached great importance to the peaceful settlement of the East Timor question. We believe that a smooth implementation of the UNAMET mandate is crucial for the future of East Timor as well as for the stability of the whole region. It will also serve as a good example to follow for other operations organized under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa03">On the basis of these considerations, the Republic of Korea decided to make a financial contribution to the United Nations trust fund for East Timor, and the Republic of Korea has made its civilian police personnel available. We will try to continue to make the appropriate contributions within the bounds of our capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa04">We appreciate the speedy planning and preparations for the popular consultation undertaken by the Secretariat thus far despite the tight schedule and under difficult circumstances. Today's adoption of the draft resolution before the Council will mark another important step in making the transition to the second phase after the popular consultation on 30 August. Now it is incumbent upon all the parties directly concerned to ensure that the transition process will take place in an uninterrupted and efficient manner.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa05">Two and half months have passed since the creation of UNAMET. During this period, a significant amount of groundwork has been laid by the Secretariat, in close cooperation with members of the Council, Indonesian authorities and donor countries, so as to move the consultation process forward as smoothly as possible. In particular, the successful completion of the registration -- including registering East Timorese who are overseas -- is highly commendable. But the tasks lying ahead of us are still many and daunting.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa06">Close coordination will remain the key to accomplishing these tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa07">In this regard, we commend the coordinating role played by the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Marker, at the political level and by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Martin, in the field. My delegation would also like to reiterate its firm commitment to continue to work with the Secretariat and other interested delegations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa08">We are encouraged to note the strong commitment by all parties concerned to maintaining an environment that is stable and free from fear, both in the run-up to the conduct of the popular consultation and beyond. In particular, we have full confidence in the commitment and capability of the Indonesian Government and people -- particularly reaffirmed this morning by Ambassador Wibisono -- to discharge effectively their primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order in East Timor. My delegation would like to echo previous speakers in emphasizing the importance of maintaining law and order throughout the process of popular consultation and beyond.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa09">I would like to conclude on a positive note about the long-term future of East Timor, given the determination that exists throughout the United Nations system, backed by the positive cooperation of all parties concerned and the widespread voluntary contributions of the international community. My delegation also hopes that the Security Council will make it a general rule to hold open debates on operational issues that involve, financially and otherwise, many Member States that are non-members of the Council at earlier stages of its deliberations, and preferably before the decision-making stage rather than towards the end of the proceedings.</p>

The people of East Timor have a unique opportunity to decide their own future. Whatever the outcome of the consultation, members of the Security Council strongly hope that the people of East Timor will respect that decision and work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future. In adopting the resolution mandating the United Nations presence until 30 November 1999, the Council is demonstrating its readiness to continue to support them after they have made their decision."</p>
