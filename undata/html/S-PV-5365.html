	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council congratulates the Palestinian people on an electoral process that was free, fair and secure. It commends all the parties for the preparation and conduct of the elections, particularly the Central Elections Commission and the Palestinian Authority security forces, for their professionalism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council expresses its expectation that a new Government will remain committed to realizing the aspirations of the Palestinian people for peace and statehood. The Security Council welcomes President Abbas' affirmation that the Palestinian Authority remains committed to the road map, previous agreements and obligations between the parties, and a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Security Council expresses its view that all members of a future Palestinian Government must be committed to the aforementioned instruments and principles.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"Cognizant of the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people, the Security Council reaffirms its continuing interest in the fiscal stability of the caretaker Government, consistent with clear reform and austerity benchmarks. The Security Council notes that major donors have indicated they will review future assistance to a new Palestinian Authority Government against that Government's commitment to the principles of non-violence, recognition of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the road map.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council reminds both parties of their obligation under the road map and on existing agreements, including on movement and access. It calls on both parties to avoid unilateral actions which prejudice final status issues. The Security Council underlines the need for the Palestinian Authority to prevent terrorist attacks and dismantle the infrastructure of terror. It reiterates its view that settlement expansion must stop and its concern regarding the route of the barrier.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms its profound attachment to the vision of two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. The Security Council reiterates the importance of and the need to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East, based on all its relevant resolutions, including its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-242(1967).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 242 (1967)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-338(1973).pdf" class="pdf">338 (1973)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1397(2002).pdf" class="pdf">1397 (2002)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1515(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1515 (2003)</a>, the Madrid terms of reference and the principle of land for peace."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-6.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/6</a>.</p>
