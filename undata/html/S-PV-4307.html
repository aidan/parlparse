	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">Since this is the last public meeting of the month and my last appearance before the Council in my current capacity, I wish to extend to all of the members of the Security Council and to all delegations our sincerest thanks for their efforts in assisting the Ukrainian presidency of the Council at all stages of the implementation of the programme we proposed for this month and beyond, for their spirit of goodwill and cooperation and for their good and thoughtful advice, even before our presidency started. I will be leaving New York with the feeling of "mission accomplished".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">On behalf of my delegation, I also wish to thank the Secretariat and all the departments that once again displayed their traditional, unfailing readiness to provide us with very useful and detailed information. We also extend our thanks to the entire team led by Mr. Stephanides for their advice, professionalism, discipline and willingness to work literally 24 hours a day, including on weekends. We are particularly grateful for their always active and unwavering assistance in preparations for the Ukrainian presidency. I also wish to convey our most cordial gratitude to the interpreters for their wonderful performance during these long hours and days of our presidency.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">I wish every success to the delegation of the United Kingdom, which will be assuming this seat in the coming days. They, like us, will appreciate members' fullest cooperation.</p>

It has given us delight to have you among us and leading us with such clarity, calmness and wisdom during the month of March.
