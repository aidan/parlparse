	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">With regard to paragraph 1 of the draft resolution, following consultations I had with member States after sending the Assembly the draft dated 13 March 2000, I have made a slight revision to the title of the overall theme of the Summit, which now reads "The role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century". This does not imply any prejudice against any other operative paragraphs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">With regard to paragraph 3 of the draft resolution, the original text did not reflect properly one of the provisions of Article 21 of the Charter of the United Nations, namely, that the General Assembly shall elect a President, not a country, for each session. Consequently, I have replaced twice in paragraph 3 the words "the country holding the presidency" by the words "the country of the President".</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">By operative paragraph 1 of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.81-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/54/L.81/Rev.1</a>, the General Assembly would decide that the Millennium Summit should be held from 6 to 8 September 2000 in New York. In connection with conference servicing requirements, the servicing of the plenary meetings would be part of the normal servicing of the sessions of the Assembly. No additional requirements would thus arise in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">By operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would decide that the Millennium Summit would be composed of plenary meetings and of four interactive round-table sessions, with each interactive session to be held in concurrence with a plenary meeting. On the basis of this decision, the related estimated costs for security and protocol requirements would amount to $450,000 and $193,000, respectively. The related provisions would be reflected in the context of the first performance report on the programme budget for 2000-2001 to be presented to the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">Consequently, should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.81-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/54/L.81/Rev.1</a>, any additional requirements which would arise would be considered in the context of the first performance report for the biennium 2000-2001 at the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.</p>
