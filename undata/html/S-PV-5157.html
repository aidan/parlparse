	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2005-174.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/174</a>, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on developments in Guinea-Bissau and on the activities of the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council recognizes some progress made in some areas in Guinea-Bissau, including the electoral process, and urges all political actors in the country to show unequivocal commitment to a peaceful electoral process, leading to peaceful, transparent, free and fair elections, by refraining from inspiring or promoting any sort of ethnic or religious hostilities, particularly with a view to obtaining political gains. In this regard, the Council strongly condemns any attempts to incite</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk07-pa05">violence and to impede ongoing efforts towards peace, stability and social and economic development.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council expresses its growing concern at recent political developments in Guinea-Bissau, in particular the decision by the 'Partido da Renovação Social' -- PRS -- to select ex-President Koumba Yala as its presidential candidate. Any decision, such as this, that challenges the Transitional Charter has the potential to jeopardize the successful conclusion of the transitional process and forthcoming presidential elections.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council expresses also its deep concern at the fact that peace efforts have not yet generated sufficient social and economic benefits for the population that could discourage the use of force.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council stresses, at the same time, the urgent need for international support to the electoral process. It recalls previous appeals for increased international assistance to Guinea-Bissau, including to the forthcoming presidential elections, as part of an urgently needed peacebuilding strategy in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council calls upon Guinea-Bissau's international development partners, including all concerned agencies of the United Nations system, to cooperate fully with the Government of Guinea-Bissau, which has been fully engaged in the implementation of the Transition Charter and in efforts to promote transparency and good governance. It welcomes, in this regard, the holding on 11 February 2005, in Lisbon, of the 'Meeting of Guinea-Bissau's Partners to prepare for the Roundtable Conference' and stresses the importance of strong participation in the Donor Roundtable Conference scheduled for October 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council welcomes initial measures taken by the Chief of General Staff regarding the process of reform of the Armed Forces and the promotion of reconciliation among the military. The Council further encourages full inclusiveness and renewed commitment to reconciliation in the Armed Forces, and development of constructive civilian-military relations based on the Armed Forces as an institution subordinated to the elected civilian</p>
