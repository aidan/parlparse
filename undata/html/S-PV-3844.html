	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1997-987.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/987</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 17 December 1997 from the Executive Chairman of the Special Commission established by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 9 (b) (i) of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 687 (1991)</a> addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council has considered the report of 17 December 1997 from the Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-987.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/987</a>) on his discussions with officials of the Government of Iraq, which took place in Baghdad 12 to 16 December 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council recalls all its relevant resolutions, including <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1137(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1137 (1997)</a>, and the statement of its President on 3 December 1997. The Council reiterates its demand that the Government of Iraq cooperate fully with the Special Commission in accordance with all relevant resolutions and that the Government of Iraq allow the Special Commission inspection teams immediate, unconditional access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of transportation which they wish to inspect in accordance with the mandate of the Special Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council stresses that failure by the Government of Iraq to provide the Special Commission with immediate, unconditional access to any site or category of sites is unacceptable and a clear violation of the relevant resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the Special Commission and its Executive Chairman, including in his ongoing discussions with officials of the Government of Iraq. The Council acknowledges that discussions are continuing on practical arrangements for implementation of all its relevant resolutions. The Council reiterates that the effectiveness and speed with which the Special Commission may accomplish its responsibilities is, above all, determined by the degree to which the Government of Iraq cooperates in disclosing the full extent and disposition of its proscribed programmes and in granting the Special Commission unimpeded access to all sites, documents, records and individuals. The Council calls upon the Government of Iraq to cooperate fully with the Special Commission in the implementation of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-56.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/56</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
