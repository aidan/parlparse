	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2006-163.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2006/163</a>, which contains the sixth report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Operations in Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council has taken note of the Secretary General's sixth report on the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB), and approves his recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council is deeply concerned by the continuing violence carried out by the Forces nationales de libération (FNL) and the fighting between them and the Burundian army, by the human rights abuses committed by both sides, as well as by factors of instability remaining in the region. It calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities and human rights abuses. It welcomes President Nkurunziza's commitment to bring to justice those responsible for such abuses and encourages the Government of Burundi to work closely with the United Nations human rights monitors to this end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the statements recently made by the FNL leader, Agathon Rwasa, in Dar es-Salaam, expressing his readiness to negotiate with a view to put a final end to violence. The Council urges both parties to seize this opportunity for negotiations with a view to bringing peace to the whole country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council requests in this context the Secretary-General to keep it regularly informed on developments in the situation, and, in consultation with the Government of Burundi, on ONUB's disengagement plan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council welcomes the progress made by the Government of Burundi since the completion of the transition, in particular its efforts to reduce poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council encourages the Burundian parties to continue on the course of the reforms agreed in Arusha, while maintaining the spirit of dialogue, consensus and inclusion which made possible the success of the transition in their country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council invites the States of the Regional Initiative to continue to work with the Burundian authorities on the consolidation of peace in the country and in the region. It encourages the international community -- including the relevant United Nations agencies -- to continue to support the Burundian authorities in the long term."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-12.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/12</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
