	<p id="pg006-bk05-pa01">It is my pleasure to address the General Assembly today on what many of us recognize to be a critical issue before the membership, something that, if properly structured, will ensure the future viability of this institution: the assessment scale. Over the past several months, our delegation has had the benefit of thoughtful engagement by many Member States on this issue. These discussions have been fruitful. We are especially encouraged by the resolution of the General Assembly to send new reform proposals to the Committee on Contributions for its consideration. Working together, I believe that we can ensure meaningful, comprehensive and long-awaited change, which will equip this Organization to face the new challenges of the new millennium.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk05-pa02">It is clear that we all benefit from this enhanced dialogue and sense of openness. My delegation has sensed a growing recognition that this institution requires a renewed involvement on the part of Member States if the United Nations is to undertake the daunting tasks that we all demand of it. One way in which we can contribute to this effort is to join together in a reform effort that draws us closer to the original ideals of the institution, a reform that is inspired by inclusiveness rather than exclusivity.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk05-pa03">The United States delegation believes strongly that this process is taking shape, but it will need a sustained commitment by all of us in order to ensure success. My delegation intends to work with all of our colleagues to promote clarity, engagement and equity in the reform agenda. To that end, we are very pleased with the response to our delegation's speech in the Fifth Committee at its resumed session calling for a review of the peacekeeping scale and a reform of peacekeeping activities in general. The United States delegation will continue its dialogue on this subject and hopes to join with like-minded nations in calling for a full-scale review of the peacekeeping scale and proposals aimed at improving United Nations peacekeeping capabilities.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk05-pa04">My delegation hopes that peacekeeping reform will guide the Fifth Committee's agenda in the month of May and that it will receive the same attention, cooperation and thoughtful concern enjoyed in regular budget discussions. As Ambassador Holbrooke recently stated in the Fifth Committee, peacekeeping is the core task for which the United Nations was formed and the one by which it will ultimately be judged. If we are to be judged kindly by future generations, we must resolve the financial and operational problems facing peacekeeping today.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk05-pa05">I thank Member States for their continued cooperation and contributions to this end on behalf of my delegation and on behalf of those in every corner of the world that depend on our best efforts.</p>
