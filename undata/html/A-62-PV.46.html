	<p id="pg001-bk02-pa01">Agenda item 12 (continued)</p>
	<p class="boldline-p" id="pg001-bk02-pa02">Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01"> Members will recall that the General Assembly held the debate on this Agenda item at its 44th plenary meeting, on 5 November 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">We shall now proceed to consider <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.9.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.9</a>. Before giving the floor to the speaker in explanation of vote before the vote, may I remind the delegates that explanations of vote are limited to ten minutes and should be made by delegates from their seats.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chernenko</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">The Russian Federation supports Qatar's draft resolution entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies." We support and actively participate in the intergovernmental process under United Nations auspices, characterized by its openness and based on the principle of constructive engagement.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">In our opinion, the process of new or restored democracies seeks to resolve two interrelated tasks. First of all, it performs an important function in providing a forum to exchange positive experiences in foundation and principles of democracy. Secondly, and no less important, is its provision of support to States as they request it. We are convinced that this type of exchange of experience and constructive involvement will allow us to enrich the very concept of democracy and give new substance to its principles.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">As was correctly noted in this draft resolution, there is not a single model or single recipe for democracy in our world. All attempts to impose unilateral approaches, any attempts to forcibly inculcate or implant, in different parts of the world, one's own approaches to democracy are fraught with the most negative consequences on the stability of different countries and regions.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">We have heard the only speaker in explanation of vote before the vote. The General Assembly will now take a decision on <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.9.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.9</a>. I should like to announce that since the introduction of the draft resolution, the following countries have become sponsors: Albania, the Bahamas, Bulgaria, Cape Verde, the Comoros, the Czech Republic, Germany, Japan, Kuwait, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Madagascar, Maldives, Mali, Monaco, Montenegro, Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Thailand, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.9.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.9</a>?</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ehouzou</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">The delegation of Benin welcomes the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.9.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.9</a>, entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies" for several reasons. As the host country of the Fourth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, held in Cotonou from 4 to 6 December 2000, Benin remains strongly committed to strengthening democracy in Africa and to the process of the International Conference of New or Restored Democracies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">On top of organizing various missions to exchange experiences, which makes it possible to weave a dense network of international cooperation and consultation with democratic national institutions, Benin was one of the main forces at the African level in the drafting of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, which was adopted by the African Union in January 2007, at Addis Ababa. This text is a priceless victory for the peoples of the African continent.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">Benin is closely following the development of the New or Restored Democracies Movement. We express our great appreciation to Qatar for its initiatives within the framework of the follow-up to the implementation of the final declaration of the Sixth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, held in Doha in November 2006. We must also welcome the activities of the Advisory Board that was established to assist the Chairman in Office of the Movement in his efforts to ensure a systematic implementation of the recommendations contained in the Doha declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">It is also fortunate that within this framework the Advisory Board was able to adopt its plan of action for the 2007-2009 period. It is important that member States be able to cooperate closely in its implementation through practical actions having an impact on the ability of democratic institutions to play their role in the operation of democratic systems put in place.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">Benin thanks all the countries that have taken different initiatives to support the efforts of new or restored democracies in their efforts to strengthen their national institutions and to promote good governance so that democracy can go hand in hand with economic growth and sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa06">The Secretary-General has presented a very informative report on Government initiatives and makes it possible to assess the dynamic of solidarity showed by the international community for new or restored democracies, but also the bold actions that those democracies have been carrying out in order to strengthen their democratic achievements. We must be grateful for these developments. It would be desirable for the next report to deal with the efforts of the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa07">My delegation reiterates its steadfast support for the process of the International Conference of New or Restored Democracies as a framework for discussion and action in order to strengthen the advances made by new or restored democracies. That is why we fully support the resolution that has just been adopted on support for new or restored democracies.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">We have heard all the speakers in explanation of vote. May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 12?</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">The Assembly will first proceed to a by-election to elect a member of the Economic and Social Council in accordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">In this connection, I would first like to draw the attention of members to <a href="../pdf/A-62-159.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/159</a>, containing a letter dated 23 July 2007 from the Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of Germany to the United Nations. In his letter, the Chargé d'affaires announces that Germany would like to relinquish its seat on the Economic and Social Council at the end of the year 2007 for the remaining term in favour of Liechtenstein. As a result, a vacancy will occur and the new member must therefore be elected to fill Germany's unexpired term of office, commencing 1 January 2008 and expiring on 31 December 2008.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971 and taking into account that the vacancy will occur from among the Western European and other States, the new member should therefore be elected from that region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">I should like to inform the Assembly that the candidate who receives a two-thirds majority and the greatest number of votes by Members present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote, there will be a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates who have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa05">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the election shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be no nominations. Also in accordance with rule 92, we shall proceed to the election by secret ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">I should like to inform members that, as of 1 January 2008, the following States from the Group of Western European and other States will be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Austria, Canada, France, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United States of America. The names of these eight States should therefore not appear on the ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">We shall now begin the voting process. Members are requested to remain seated until all ballots have been collected.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Ballot papers will now be distributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot papers and to write on them the name of the State for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains the name of more than one Member State from the relevant region for the one vacant seat assigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if the name of the Member State on that ballot does not belong to the relevant region.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa03">Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, Liechtenstein has thus been elected a member of the Economic and Social Council for a term of office beginning on 1 January 2008 and ending on 31 December 2008.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa04">I congratulate Liechtenstein on having been elected a member of the Economic and Social Council.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa05">The General Assembly will next turn to the election of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa06">The 18 outgoing members are: Albania, Brazil, Chad, China, Costa Rica, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Guinea, Iceland, India, Lithuania, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Thailand and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Pursuant to rule 146 of the rules of procedure, these countries are eligible for immediate re-election.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa07">Members will recall that Germany relinquished its seat on the Economic and Social Council, effective 1 January 2008 and Liechtenstein has just been elected to fill that vacancy.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa08">Consequently, as of 1 January 2008, the following States will be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Algeria, Angola, Austria, Barbados, Belarus, Benin, Bolivia, Canada, Cape Verde, Cuba, the Czech Republic, El Salvador, France, Greece, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, the Netherlands, Paraguay, the Philippines, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and the United States of America. The names of these 36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa09">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account the number of States that will remain members of the Council after 1 January 2008, the 18 members should be elected as follows: four from African States, four from Asian States, three from Eastern European States, three from Latin American and Caribbean States and four from Western European and other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa10">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, who receive a two-thirds majority of votes and the greatest number of votes and by Members present and voting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">I should like to seek the usual cooperation of representatives during the time of the conduct of the election. Please be reminded that during the voting process, all campaigning should cease in the General Assembly Hall. This means in particular that once the meeting has begun, no more campaign material can be distributed inside the Hall. All delegates are also requested to remain at their seats so that the voting process can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank members for their cooperation.</p>

A ballot will also be declared invalid if all the names of the Member States on the ballot do not belong to the relevant region. If a ballot paper for a region contains some of the names of the Member States that do not belong to the region, the ballot remains valid but only the names of the Member States that belong to the relevant region will be counted. The names of Member States that do not belong to that region will not be counted at all.</p>
