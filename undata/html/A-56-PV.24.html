<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Today is a momentous day. We are all thrilled that our Organization and the Secretary-General have been awarded the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize.</div>
	<div class="p">I now have the honour to read a message from the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Han Seung-soo, who is currently in Seoul, Korea. His message is addressed to the United Nations and Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the occasion of the Nobel Committee's announcement that the Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded to the United Nations and Secretary-General Kofi Annan. It reads:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"It is with great pleasure that I extend my heartfelt congratulations, on behalf of the whole United Nations membership, to our Organization, the United Nations, and its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, on their winning of the Nobel Peace Prize this year. This is a well-deserved honour for all the Member States of the United Nations as well as for the entire staff of the Secretariat.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"As members of the United Nations family, we all feel proud that during the last half century the United Nations has always been at the forefront of efforts to achieve peace and security as well as the prosperity and development of mankind. This prize is a recognition of not only the achievements of the United Nations in serving the world community, but also of that of the thousands of United Nations staff members led by the Secretary-General who work with such dedication and often in perilous circumstances to make this world a better and safer place. At the same time, I believe this award will serve to encourage all of us to make further efforts to accomplish our mandates for humanity.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"This Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the United Nations and Secretary-General Kofi Annan is most fitting, as we are facing formidable challenges such as poverty, terrorism, drug abuse, environmental degradation and HIV/AIDS.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"My special and warmest congratulations go to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in particular. I truly believe that all of us in the United Nations owe him a large debt of gratitude for his outstanding leadership and services at this critical time in history, of which the Nobel Peace Prize is a most fitting and timely recognition.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Finally, I sincerely hope that the international community will view this award not just as recognition of past achievement but, more importantly, as a beacon illuminating the way forward for the United Nations as it rises to confront new challenges."</div>
	<div class="p">Before I invite the Secretary-General to take the floor, may I also add my own voice. I am thrilled that you, Mr. Secretary-General, and our Organization, which you lead, have been awarded the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize. It is a recognition of your personal dedication and contribution to promoting peace, development, justice and human rights, often in trying circumstances, and of the United Nations ability to rise to the challenges, old and new, to make the world a better place to live in for every man and woman around the world. Please accept, Mr. Secretary-General, my hearty congratulations on this momentous occasion of recognition so fittingly awarded to you and to the United Nations under your leadership.</div>
	<div class="p">I now invite the Secretary-General to say a few words.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The decision of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee is truly an honour for the whole of the United Nations, which means of course all of its Member States and this Assembly, which represents them. It is also an honour for all parts of the Organization and, above all, for its dedicated staff around the world. They work hard every day to make the world a more just, a more peaceful and a happier place. Many of them risk their lives, and they richly deserve this award.</div>
	<div class="p">A year ago, your heads of State and Government reaffirmed at the Millennium Summit the indispensable role of the United Nations as a common house of the entire human family. Now the Nobel Committee has used this prize, in its own words,</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"to proclaim that the only negotiable route to global peace and cooperation goes by way of the United Nations".</div>
	<div class="p">In a world that is growing ever closer and more interconnected, and yet is still torn by brutal conflicts and cruel injustice, it is more important than ever that humanity travel that route and that all of us work hard to pave the road ahead of it.</div>
	<div class="p">All of us who work at the United Nations should feel proud today, but also humble, because even more will be expected of us in the future. This award is a tribute, above all, to our colleagues who have made the supreme sacrifice in the service of humanity. The only true prize for them and for us will be peace itself.</div>

	<div class="p">I am indeed overwhelmed to be standing here on this momentous day to express, on behalf of my brothers in the Group of African States, our sincere congratulations to our Organization and to a distinguished son of Africa -- and, indeed, of the world -- Mr. Kofi Annan.</div>
	<div class="p">The decision on this award has come at a very opportune time, when the United Nations is facing considerable challenges. This distinguished son of Africa and of the world, Mr. Kofi Annan, assumed the leadership of our Organization at a time when the ship was sailing through rough seas. We have witnessed his competence, his perspicacity and his wisdom in steering this ship during these critical times, which are becoming even more critical and more challenging. Therefore, we find that the selection of the United Nations and the Secretary-General for this prize represents a great moral support for and recognition of each and every one of us in our pursuit of the right path and the right choices.</div>
	<div class="p">Mr. Secretary-General, we congratulate ourselves and we congratulate you. In conclusion, I would say that the prize itself is honoured by dint of its having been given to you, because, as you said, though we feel proud we also feel humble. We have known you to be a humble person, and we pray to God Almighty to help you in your future tasks.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p"> The General Assembly will proceed to the election of a member of the International Court of Justice for the unexpired term of office of Judge and former President Mohammed Bedjaoui, whose resignation took effect on 30 September 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">In connection with this election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the members of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">First, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 264 (III) of 8 October 1948, a State which is a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice, but not a Member of the United Nations, shall participate in the General Assembly in electing the members of the Court in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. Therefore, on this occasion, the representative of Switzerland may participate in the election.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, I should like to confirm that, at this time, the Security Council, independently of the General Assembly, is also proceeding to elect one member of the Court. This procedure is in accordance with article 8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The General Assembly and the Security Council shall proceed independently of one another to elect the members of the Court."</div>
	<div class="p">Accordingly, the results of the voting in the General Assembly will not be communicated to the Security Council until one candidate has obtained the required majority in the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The Assembly has before it document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-372">A/56/372</a>, which contains a memorandum by the Secretary-General on the present composition of the Court and on the procedure to be followed in the General Assembly and in the Security Council with regard to the election; and documents <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-373">A/56/373</a>, which contains the list of nominations of candidates by national groups within the required time for submission, that is, by 12 September 2001, and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-373/Add.1">A/56/373/Add.1</a>, which informs of the withdrawal of one candidate. With reference to the list of nominations of candidates by national groups contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-373">A/56/373</a>, I would like to inform the Assembly that, subsequently, the Secretariat was informed that the Italian national group nominated Mr. Nabil Elaraby as a candidate.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly also has before it documents <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-374">A/56/374</a>, <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-374">A/56/374</a>/Corr.1 in Arabic only, and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-374">A/56/374</a>/Corr.2, which contain the curricula vitae of the candidates nominated by national groups.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes in both the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered elected.</div>
	<div class="p">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General Assembly are all 189 Member States, plus the one non-Member State which is a party to the Statute of the Court, namely Switzerland, for a total of 190 electors. Accordingly, for the present election, 96 votes constitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly will now proceed to a secret ballot. If in the first ballot no candidate obtains an absolute majority, it will be necessary to proceed to other ballots until a candidate has obtained the required majority. Pursuant to the decision taken by the General Assembly at its 915th meeting, on 16 November 1960, these ballots shall be unrestricted.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to the procedures I have just outlined?</div>

	<div class="p">As a result of the independent voting in the Security Council and in the General Assembly, Mr. Nabil Elaraby has obtained an absolute majority in both organs. He is therefore duly elected a member of the International Court of Justice, to serve for a term of office commencing today, 12 October 2001, and ending on 5 February 2006.
