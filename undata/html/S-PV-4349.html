<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council takes note with satisfaction of the progress made so far in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council calls on all the parties to the conflict to fulfil all their commitments, implement fully the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-815.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/815</a>) and complete the disengagement and redeployment of their forces in accordance with the Kampala plan and the Harare sub-plans, which the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) will verify.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council finds it unacceptable that more than one year after the adoption of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1304(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1304 (2000)</a> of 16 June 2000 containing the demand completely to demilitarize Kisangani, reiterated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1355(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1355 (2001)</a> of 15 June 2001, the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie has thus far failed to comply with it. The Council calls on the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie to implement fully and immediately its obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1304(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1304 (2000)</a>, and notes that continued failure to do so may have future implications.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reminds all the parties of their obligation to cooperate fully with MONUC and of their obligations with respect to the security of civilian populations under the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949. The Council urges the relevant parties to expedite conclusion of their investigation into the killing of six International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) staff in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, to report their findings to the ICRC and to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council calls on all parties to facilitate and support humanitarian efforts of the United Nations and non-governmental organizations. It stresses the importance of the work of the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates its call for the cessation of the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In this regard, it calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the expert panel and, looking forward to the addendum to the report of the panel, reiterates its readiness to consider the necessary actions to put an end to this exploitation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council reiterates its demand on all parties to accelerate the finalization and the implementation of comprehensive plans for the orderly withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement of all armed groups referred to in annex A, chapter 9.1, of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council expresses serious concern over the activities of the armed groups in the East of the country. It takes note with interest of the invitation by the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to MONUC to visit the camps where some members of the armed groups have reportedly been quartered by the Forces armées congolaises, and stresses the importance of MONUC assisting, within its capabilities, in the early implementation, on a voluntary basis, of the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement of these armed groups, in accordance with the authorization given in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1355(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1355 (2001)</a>. The Council requests in this regard the donor community, in particular the World Bank and the European Union, to provide financial and in kind contributions as soon as possible to MONUC in the implementation of this mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council reiterates its firm support for the inter-Congolese dialogue and the efforts of the facilitator and his team in the field. It emphasizes the importance of an open, representative and inclusive dialogue, free from outside interference and involving civil society, leading to a consensus settlement. It calls on the Congolese parties to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement to cooperate fully with the facilitator to enable him to conduct the process in a swift and constructive manner. It expresses the hope that the dialogue can be held on Congolese soil, respecting the choice that the Congolese actors themselves will make. It encourages donors to continue to provide support to the facilitator's mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">"The Security Council welcomes the recent high-level meetings between the Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda and encourages them further to pursue the dialogue to find solutions to their common security concerns in accordance with the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">"The Security Council reiterates its commitment to support full implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. It reaffirms that the primary responsibility for implementing the Agreement lies with the parties. The Council urges them to demonstrate necessary political will by cooperating with each other and with MONUC in achieving this goal. It expresses its readiness to consider, subject to necessary progress made by the parties and to recommendations of the Secretary-General, possible expansion of MONUC if and when the mission enters its third phase.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">"The Security Council commends the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Kamel Morjane, for his outstanding work and invaluable contribution to the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">That statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-19.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/19</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa17">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
