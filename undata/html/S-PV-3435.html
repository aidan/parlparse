I am sure I speak for all members of the Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Yañez-Barnuevo for the great diplomatic skill and unfailing courtesy with which he conducted the Council's business last month.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1137.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1137</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 6 October 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Kuwait to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council notes with grave concern the statement issued on 6 October 1994 by the Revolutionary Command Council of Iraq. It underlines the complete unacceptability of the implication therein that Iraq may withdraw cooperation from the United Nations Special Commission. The Security Council emphasizes the necessity of full implementation of all its relevant resolutions, including full cooperation by Iraq, without interference, with the United Nations Special Commission's vital mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council has also received with grave concern reports that substantial numbers of Iraqi troops, including units of the Iraqi Republican Guard, are being redeployed in the direction of the border with Kuwait.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Security Council therefore requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) redoubles its vigilance and reports immediately any violation of the demilitarized zone established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 687 (1991)</a> or any potentially hostile action.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. It underlines Iraq's full responsibility to accept all the obligations contained in all its relevant resolutions and to comply fully therewith.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-58.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/58</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
