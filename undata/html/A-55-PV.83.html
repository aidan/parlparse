	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa01">The General Assembly, in accordance with decision 55/410, adopted at its 61st plenary meeting on 14 November 2000, will observe this morning, under agenda item 18, the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa02">The General Assembly is today observing the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. This Declaration, together with the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, has laid the foundation for the role and responsibility of the United Nations in upholding the principle of the right to self-determination.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa03">In December 1960, the representative of Cambodia, in introducing the draft resolution containing the Declaration, pointed out that the sponsors of the draft were anxious that the Declaration should be yet another step forward in the process of the emancipation of peoples. He also stressed the need for all countries concerned to support the Declaration in order to ensure peaceful development and freedom for all those peoples who had not yet gained independence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa04">The General Assembly, composed at the time of 99 Member States, adopted the Declaration by an overwhelming majority. Within a year, the Assembly had established a Committee to monitor the implementation of the Declaration, and in 1962 it issued a preliminary list of some 64 Non-Self-Governing Territories to which the Declaration applied.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa05">The Declaration proclaimed the necessity of bringing to a speedy and unconditional end colonialism in all its forms and manifestations. The Assembly declared that all peoples have the right to self-determination and that, by virtue of that right, they may freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. Year after year, the Assembly has reaffirmed the principles enshrined in the Charter and has reiterated that the administering Powers have a special responsibility to promote to the utmost, within the system of international peace and security, the well-being of the inhabitants of the Non-Self-Governing Territories under their responsibility.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa06">The membership of the United Nations has more than doubled since the adoption of the Declaration. A total of 189 Member States, many of them former Non-Self-Governing Territories, are now called on to observe the anniversary of this historic document and acknowledge the urgency of realizing its goal: the eradication of colonialism. At the Millennium Summit three months ago, Member States reiterated the right to self-determination of peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa07">Today there are still 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories to which the Declaration applies and to which the Assembly will continue to give its full attention. One of these -- East Timor -- has exercised its right to self-determination and chosen the path to independence. Just over a year ago the people of East Timor, in a free and fair referendum, voted for independence. Since then, the process towards national reconciliation and nation-building has been carried out with the support of the United Nations. The Territory is currently under the administration of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), and it is making strides in preparing the necessary conditions for independence. The international community has followed closely these historic developments in East Timor and the important role played by the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa08">I am therefore very pleased to be able to announce that, at the invitation of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello of UNTAET, I will be visiting East Timor early next year. The purpose of my visit is to familiarize myself with the situation in East Timor and with the work of UNTAET firsthand. In the light of the Millennium Summit and the current discussions on the reform of peacekeeping, the visit should also be particularly interesting, given the complex and multidimensional nature of the UNTAET peacekeeping operation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa09">To conclude, I should like to stress that the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration, at the dawn of the millennium, offers us an opportunity not only to look back at the successes the United Nations has achieved in the field of decolonization, but also, more importantly, to look ahead and reiterate our commitment to fulfil its objectives and redouble our efforts to that end.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa10">I now give the floor to the Under-Secretary-General of the Department for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, Mr. Yongjian Jin, who will deliver a message from the Secretary-General.</div>

</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01">The Secretary-General is away and has requested that I deliver the following message on his behalf. The Secretary-General's message on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples reads as follows:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">"The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly 40 years ago, represented a universal reaffirmation of a historic process of emancipation, freedom and self-rule. The Declaration was not only an expression of support by the overwhelming majority of United Nations Member States for the liberation struggle of colonial territories, but also became a forceful tool with which to spur on the implementation of the Charter's provisions on Non-Self-Governing Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa03">"The United Nations success in the area of decolonization can be most vividly observed in this very Assembly. More than 60 nations represented in this Hall have achieved independence and joined the United Nations as sovereign States in the four decades since the Declaration was adopted. While there is good cause for celebration, there is also a need for awareness of the challenges ahead, as the United Nations faces the task of completing the implementation of the Declaration and all the relevant resolutions of the Organization on decolonization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa04">"During the past decade, the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples has played an important role in maintaining a spotlight on the remaining 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, not least in providing a forum for their peoples to voice their thoughts and aspirations regarding their future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa05">"The principles enunciated in the Declaration resonate with force at the dawn of the new Millennium. In spite of all that has been accomplished, the Declaration is yet to be implemented in the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories. I take this opportunity to reiterate an appeal to the administering Powers concerned to cooperate in this endeavour by assisting the Special Committee in the discharge of the important mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly".</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa01">The General Assembly is today observing the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. That historic Declaration embodied the international community's conviction that the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories should enjoy the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and that the continued existence of colonialism was in contradiction to the United Nations ideals.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The General Assembly has continued, throughout the intervening period, to urge Member States to comply with its Declaration and has continued to guide the work of the United Nations on decolonization. Through the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the General Assembly has kept the situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories under constant review and has adopted concrete proposals to bring about the speedy elimination of colonialism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Today we observe the anniversary of the Declaration at the same time as the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism is coming to an end. It is regrettable that four decades later, and despite the successes the United Nations has seen in its efforts to promote the decolonization process, colonialism persists. Without wishing to minimize the challenges ahead, however, the Special Committee remains convinced that, with the cooperation of the administering Powers, progress towards implementing the Declaration can be achieved. Thus, efforts for a sustained, purposeful dialogue should continue and intensify.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa04">The overwhelming support for the decolonization process continues unabated. Many countries, mine included, which came to independence under the watchful eye of the United Nations, are in this General Assembly today, commemorating the adoption of the Declaration that gave renewed impetus to the cause of decolonization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The message of the Special Committee to the international community and to the Non-Self-Governing Territories on this special occasion is very clear: we will continue to work to carry out the mandate entrusted to us by the General Assembly, which has been reaffirmed and strengthened by successive decisions and resolutions of the Assembly, until the objectives of the Declaration have been attained.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Bakoniarivo" nation="Madagascar" language="French">
	Mr. Bakoniarivo (Madagascar)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa01">On behalf of the Group of African States, which Madagascar is chairing for the month of December 2000, it is my honour to speak today on the subject of agenda item 18, entitled "Observance of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples". That Declaration, adopted by the United Nations under resolution 1514 (XV) on 14 December 1960, has marked the history of international relations and reflects the commitment of the international community to the purposes and principles of the Charter, including the right of peoples to self-determination.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa02">This anniversary is of particular importance to Africa, which shall the continents has paid the heaviest price as a result of colonization. Indeed, when the United Nations was established in San Francisco in 1945, only four African States were in a position to join this international Organization as independent countries. The rest of the African continent was still under colonial domination.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa03">Furthermore, when the United Nations was created in 1945, two thirds of the present Member States were not yet independent. At present, 17 territories are still not autonomous and are demanding their freedom and their right to self-determination. This bears witness to the fact that undeniable efforts for decolonization have been made, but much remains to be done.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa04">In this respect, we wish to express our gratitude to the United Nations, particularly to the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples -- for the efforts made to implement resolution 1514 (XV) in all the territories to which the Declaration applies, with a view to bringing a speedy and unconditional end to colonialism in all its forms and manifestations, in application of Article 73 of the United Nations Charter and the Declaration; for organizing regional seminars, which made it possible to assess the achievements of the first International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, adopted by the General Assembly in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf">resolution 46/181</a> of 19 December 1991; and for planning the strategy and the future activities of the United Nations regarding decolonization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa05">We also wish to pay warm tribute to the courageous freedom fighters who write the whole of the history of their struggle in letters of blood, at the cost of their lives.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa06">Forty years have elapsed since the adoption of the Declaration whose anniversary we are observing today; but, unfortunately, we have to note that many problems of the last century will probably still exist in the new century. Decolonization is one of many.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa07">While enormous progress has been made in eliminating colonialism during the last decade, much still remains to be done to ensure the total eradication of this scourge. The exercise of the inalienable rights of peoples of non-autonomous territories, particularly as regards small island developing States and their vulnerable social sectors, requires the continuation and consolidation of our efforts so that the United Nations can complete its decolonization work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa08">The main challenge we must face during the upcoming 2001-2110 decade, and in this commemoration is to complete the efforts that were made during the past decade to ensure that in the new century the world will be free from the yoke of colonialism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa09">According to the Millennium Declaration recently adopted by all the world's leaders in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-2.pdf">resolution 55/2</a>,</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa10">"We are determined to establish a just and lasting peace all over the world in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter. We rededicate ourselves to support all efforts to uphold the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence ... [and] the right to self-determination of peoples which remain under colonial domination and foreign occupation". (<i>para. 4</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa11">We hope that during the new decade the Member States will redouble their efforts in the specialized agencies and other United Nations bodies to ensure the full and effective implementation of the Declaration and of other relevant resolutions of the United Nations on this subject.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa12">May this event give new energy to our common struggle for universal and effective respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without regard to race, sex, language or religion. We also hope that this commemorative meeting will strengthen our commitment to the values and ideals of the United Nations to bring out a world of peace, equity and justice.</div>

	Mr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I feel greatly honoured to address this body in my capacity as Chairman of the Asian Group for the month of December 2000, on an occasion of particular significance to us: the observance of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa02">We are privileged to deliberate on the observance of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration at the beginning of the new millennium, when our Organization is assessing its past actions in all spheres of its work, including that of decolonization, concerning which the General Assembly has solemnly reaffirmed its strong commitment to the right of peoples to self-determination. In the past four decades since the adoption by the General Assembly of this important document, decolonization has greatly accelerated around the world. The presence in the General Assembly of so many formerly colonized nations is the brightest testimony to this.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa03">By launching in 1990 an International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, the United Nations reinforced its efforts to achieve the objectives of the Declaration. Enormous efforts have been made in this regard by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration over the past decades. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Special Committee and to its Chairman, Ambassador Peter Donigi of Papua New Guinea, for their outstanding commitment and for their untiring efforts to fulfil the mandate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa04">Despite the impressive progress made since the adoption of the Declaration and the establishment of the Special Committee, the process of decolonization is not entirely complete. We cannot ignore the fact that 17 cases of Non-Self-Governing Territories are still under review by the Special Committee. The United Nations and the international community at large are duty-bound to bring colonialism to a complete end. Progress in decolonization is closely connected with the protection and implementation of the right of the peoples of the Territories mentioned above to self-determination. This requires the joint efforts of the United Nations, the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories and the administering Powers.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa05">The majority of the Non-Self-Governing Territories are small islands that confront unique problems arising from their small size and population, their limited natural resources and their vulnerability to natural disasters. It is therefore essential that the international community be sensitive to their needs and responsive to their requests for assistance. In this respect, the role of the United Nations programmes and specialized agencies is of utmost importance for accelerating progress in their economic and social sectors.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa06">Last July the Special Committee adopted a resolution proposing that the current session of the General Assembly declare the decade from 2001 to 2010 as the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. It is our earnest hope that the proclamation of the Second Decade will further accelerate the process of decolonization and bring it to a successful end. This is a goal and a constant challenge which must be pursued without pause for as long as there remain Non-Self-Governing Territories.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa02">In a few days, on 14 December, the peoples of the world will mark the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of a document of historic significance: the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. While observing that upcoming event today, it is important to emphasize the outstanding role that document has played in the history of mankind and the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa03">It was that Declaration that set forth the fundamental principle of self-determination, which remains one of the cornerstones of contemporary international relations. The Declaration set in motion the process of decolonization, which enabled many peoples in the former Non-Self-Governing Territories -- despite their small size and population, geographic remoteness and limited natural resources -- to exercise their choice to freely determine their political status and to freely pursue economic, social and cultural development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa04">A review of the efforts of the United Nations over the past four decades since the adoption of the Declaration offers grounds for believing that decolonization is one of the most significant achievements of this Organization. Indeed, the successes in pursuing this process are well known. Let me recall some of them. Dozens of former colonies, inhabited by more than 80 million people, have gained their long-awaited independence. All eleven Trust Territories have exercised their right to self-determination by obtaining independence or free association with an independent State. Due to its untiring efforts in the implementation of this document, the United Nations family of nations has been replenished with the essential number of new Members, and has become a unique global Organization of universal nature.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa05">At the same time, however encouraging the outcome of the process launched by the Declaration, there is an obvious need to intensify our common efforts aimed at bringing it to its logical conclusion. One should not forget that the United Nations is still responsible for 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories which continue to strive to determine their future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The Group of Eastern European States expresses its hope that today's decision by the General Assembly to proclaim the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism will contribute to the final elimination of colonialism in all of its forms and manifestations. It is also our belief that the Special Committee on Decolonization will continue its undaunted commitment to putting the last vestiges of the colonial era behind us.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Exactly three months ago, the heads of State and Government gathered at the Millennium Summit adopted the Millennium Declaration, in which they undertook to rededicate themselves to support all efforts to uphold the right to self-determination of peoples that have not yet attained a full measure of self-government. Thus, the lofty principles and goals enshrined in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples 40 years ago have once again found solid support.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa08">In this respect, it is important that in the years to come all Members of the United Nations redouble their efforts towards reaching the ultimate goal of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in order to bring about the complete and speedy eradication of colonialism. Let us work together to that end.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa01">My delegation has the honour to address the Assembly, on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, on the occasion of the commemoration of an event that is of special importance to the United Nations: the fortieth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which was adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa02">For the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, this anniversary is doubly important and symbolic. Of the 33 States members of our group, 12 were included in the General Assembly's list of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1960.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa03">A process of integration has taken place in our region as in few other regions of the world. What at first was only Latin America was gradually enriched by the addition of the nations of the Caribbean that gained their independence and entered the United Nations as Member States. Today, we can testify to the fraternity and unity of our Group.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Our region has played a key role in the grand process of decolonization promoted by the United Nations, even prior to the acclaimed Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Indeed, in the negotiations on the Charter of San Francisco, the Latin American republics emerged as the voice of those who still had no voice, and, since 1945, they have been fighting for the exercise of the right to self-determination and for the decolonization of the fraternal peoples of the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Pacific.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa05">Regrettably, there are still 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United Nations list, eight of them situated on the American continent. The Special Committee on Decolonization must continue its work until those Territories are decolonized.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa06">In the majority of the Territories that remain on the list, their peoples should be able to exercise their right to self-determination and thus freely to choose independence, integration or free association with an independent State.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Also on the list are special cases such as the dispute over sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, located in our continent. This matter should be resolved through negotiations between the Government of the Republic of Argentina and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa08">Moreover, we should also like to point out that, this year for the first time, the Special Committee on Decolonization has finally adopted by consensus a resolution on Puerto Rico, which, among other things, reiterates that the Puerto Rican people constitutes a Latin American and Caribbean nation that has its own and unequivocal national identity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa09">We hope that in the years ahead, the Special Committee will make substantive progress in its review of the situation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. It should be remembered that, in 1998, the Special Committee decided to embark on a critical review of its work. This review was completed on 20 March 2000, when the Special Committee completed the elaboration of an informal programme of work that could be used as a model to be applied on a case-by-case basis to the respective Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa10">The Special Committee must necessarily be given the support of the administering Powers, duly taking into consideration the aspirations of the inhabitants of the Territories in order to elaborate the respective work programmes during the year 2001 in accordance with United Nations resolutions on decolonization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa11">Lastly, and for all the reasons set out above, the Latin American and Caribbean Group wishes to express its support for the proclamation of the period 2001-2010 as the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism.</div>

We must seize the moment and find in the spirit of freedom that engulfed the world 40 years ago the inspiration and the hope to build a new world where nations are equal in rights, responsibilities and levels of development. We must go beyond political independence and towards equal and fair interdependence. This is a goal that is dear to the WEOG States.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk05">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Mekdad" nation="Syria" language="">
	Mr. Mekdad (Syria)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa01">In my capacity as Rapporteur, I have the honour to present the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for consideration by the General Assembly. The report is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-23.pdf">A/55/23</a> (Parts I-III) and covers the work the Special Committee carried out during 2000.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa02">The report is being submitted in accordance with paragraph 8 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-91.pdf">resolution 54/91</a>, regarding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The Special Committee was requested to continue to seek suitable means for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and to carry out those actions approved by the Assembly regarding the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that have not yet exercised their right to self-determination, including independence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa03">The report of the Special Committee consists of three parts. All its recommendations for action by the General Assembly are presented in part III of the report.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa04">Part I contains the general introductory chapters, which describe the organization of the Committee and its activities on all the matters entrusted to it, and its relations with United Nations bodies and intergovernmental, non-governmental and regional organizations. It also reflects the Committee's action relating to international conventions. I draw the Assembly's attention, in particular, to section J of part I, which outlines the future programme of work that the Committee proposes to carry out during the year 2001, which, subject to a decision by the General Assembly, will be the first year of the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa05">Part I also includes, as an annex, the report of the Pacific regional seminar, held in Majuro, Marshall Islands, to review the political, economic and social conditions in the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories. I commend this report for the Assembly's careful perusal, as it describes the seminar's frank and open discussions, the views of the participants and their recommendations. The Special Committee gave due consideration to these recommendations of the seminar in formulating its future plans.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa06">Part II of the report provides a procedural account of the Committee's deliberations regarding the substantive issues on its agenda. These include the dissemination of information on decolonization; the question of sending visiting missions to the Territories; economic and other activities that affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories; military activities carried out by the administering Powers in the Territories under their administration; and the implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and international institutions associated with the United Nations. It also contains information from the Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 <i>e</i> of the Charter of the United Nations and describes the action taken by the Committee regarding each of the 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa07">Finally, as stated earlier, Part III of the report contains all the recommendations of the Special Committee to be placed before the Assembly some of which have been considered by the Fourth Committee. All the draft resolutions and decisions will be presented in proper order by the Rapporteur of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) in his report to the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa08">The Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples has formulated specific proposals for the elimination of the remaining manifestations of colonialism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa09">During the period under review, it has examined the implementation by Member States of resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions on decolonization. It has continued to pay special attention to the situation in the small Territories and has recommended the most suitable measures that would enable the people of those Territories to exercise their right to self-determination. It has taken steps to enlist worldwide support among Governments and regional, national, international and non-governmental organizations to achieve the objectives of the Declaration and to implement the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Mekdad" nation="Syria" language="">
	Mr. Mekdad (Syria)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa01">It has requested the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to provide economic, social and other assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories. Throughout the period under review, the Special Committee has continued its efforts to engage the administering Powers in a dialogue and to seek their cooperation in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to it. The Special Committee seeks to work formally with all administrating Powers in a spirit of cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa02">The proposals contained in the report of the Special Committee are based on a case-by-case examination of the Non-Self-Governing Territories under its mandate. These were formulated and adopted after due consideration of all aspects of the situation prevailing in those Territories, including the constitutional and political situation and socio-economic developments.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa03">In the fulfilment of its tasks, the Special Committee has benefited from the substantive information provided in Secretariat working papers on each Non-Self-Governing Territory. These working papers are based on information provided by the administering Powers under Article 73 <i>e</i> of the Charter. As in the past, valuable information has also been received from representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories who participated in the meetings of the Special Committee and in its regional seminars. Media reports and information provided by regional non-governmental organizations and experts have also been useful sources. However, in the view of the Special Committee, the sending of visiting missions to the Non-Self-Governing Territories themselves remains the best way of obtaining first-hand knowledge of the realities in the Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa04">The Special Committee has not been able to send visiting missions for several years. However, in their absence, regional seminars have provided a useful alternative. These seminars are held in the Caribbean and the Pacific regions, often in host countries situated in the vicinity of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and sharing the problems that small island territories experience. The seminars thus continue to serve as an opportunity for Committee members to have direct contact with some of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. The seminars have also been crucial in bringing together representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories, non-governmental organizations, experts and scholars to interact and to exchange views on the status and developments in the Territories. The participants share information on issues of common concern, present papers and make recommendations on various aspects of the process of decolonization. Furthermore, they have direct access to the members of the Special Committee in an informal environment, to discuss their views and concerns and to learn about the Special Committee's activities. I draw the Assembly's attention again to the report of the Pacific regional seminar annexed to the Committee's report.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa05">The report of the Special Committee notes with satisfaction that in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, New Zealand, as the administering Power concerned, continued to participate actively in the work of the Special Committee. The delegation of France participated in the Committee's work during the consideration of the question of New Caledonia. Although the delegations of the United Kingdom and the United States did not formally take part in the work of the Committee, both administering Powers have expressed their desire to continue an informal dialogue with the Committee. Throughout the reporting period, Portugal participated in the meetings of the Special Committee during its consideration of the question of East Timor. The Committee acceded to the request of Spain to participate in the proceedings on the question of Gibraltar and to the requests of Argentina, Brazil -- on behalf of the States members of the Southern Common Market plus Bolivia and Chile -- Paraguay and Uruguay to participate in the consideration of the item on the Falkland Islands (Malvinas).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa06">With respect to the work of the Special Committee regarding the social and economic aspects of the situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Chairman or Acting Chairman continued to attend the meetings of the Economic and Social Council on the implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies. In addition, pursuant to a proposal to hold a joint meeting with the Economic and Social Council, the Special Committee established a working group entrusted with the preparation of such a meeting.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa07">This year, the Special Committee, pursuant to its decision of 6 July 1999 concerning Puerto Rico, considered a report on that issue and adopted a resolution (A/AC.109/2000/24). By the terms of its resolution, the Special Committee, among other things, reaffirmed the hope that the Government of the United States of America would expedite a process that will allow the Puerto Rican people to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence in conformity with resolution 1514 (XV) and Special Committee resolutions and decisions on Puerto Rico. It also encouraged the Government of the United States to order the halt of its armed forces military drills and manoeuvres on Vieques island, to return the occupied land to the people of Puerto Rico, to halt the persecution, arrests and harassment of peaceful demonstrators and to respect the right to health and economic development; it also welcomed the release of Puerto Rican prisoners and expressed hope that the President of the United States would release all political prisoners serving sentences on cases related to the struggle for the independence of Puerto Rico.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa08">The Special Committee discharged the tasks entrusted to it by the General Assembly during the year in a cooperative, transparent and pragmatic manner. It held both formal and informal meetings and consultations in order to reach consensus and formulate its recommendations. Its consultations included member States, non-members of the Special Committee, administering Powers and representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Altogether it held 15 formal meetings and 15 informal meetings and numerous informal consultations carried out by officers of the Special Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa09">Allow me very briefly to outline some of the actions and recommendations being put before the Assembly for its consideration. The Special Committee examined the issue of information regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted to the Secretary-General under Article 73 <i>e</i> of the United Nations Charter. It reiterated its recommendation to the General Assembly that in the absence of a decision by the Assembly itself stating that a Territory had attained a full measure of self-government in terms of Chapter XI of the Charter, the administering Power concerned should continue to transmit information under Article 73 <i>e</i> with respect to that Territory.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa10">In its consideration of the question of economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Special Committee affirmed the value of foreign economic investment undertaken in collaboration with the peoples of the Territories. It reaffirmed the responsibility of the administering Powers to promote political, economic and social advancement in Territories under their administration. At the same time, the Special Committee also affirmed the need to avoid any economic and other activities that would adversely affect the interests of the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Therefore, the Special Committee recommended, among other things, that the Assembly urge the administering Powers to take effective measures to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of peoples in Non-Self-Governing Territories to their natural resources, and requested the administering Powers to take all necessary steps to protect the property rights of the peoples of those Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa11">The Special Committee has continued to pay special attention to the needs of the small island Territories. Their unique problems, arising from their small size and population, limited natural resources and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards, require the sustained cooperation and assistance of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa12">Reaffirming that the exercise of the right of self-determination by Non-Self-Governing Territories entails the extension, as a corollary, of all appropriate assistance to their inhabitants, the Special Committee paid particular attention to the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations. It welcomed the assistance provided so far but noted that only some specialized agencies and organizations of the United Nations system have been involved in providing such assistance to Non-Self-Governing Territories. It urged those agencies and organizations that had not yet provided assistance to do so as soon as possible. The Special Committee will continue to consult with the Economic and Social Council in its efforts to implement the Declaration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa13">In particular, the Special Committee requested the specialized agencies and other organizations to provide information on the special needs and vulnerabilities of small island Territories, including ways and means to assist them in fighting drug trafficking and other criminal activities. In this regard, the Special Committee recommended to the General Assembly that it request the relevant agencies, organizations and institutions of the United Nations system to strengthen existing measures of support and to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, within the framework of their respective mandates, in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa14">In addition, the Special Committee also recommended that the General Assembly welcome the adoption by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean of resolution 574 (XXVII). This resolution called for the provision of necessary mechanisms to permit its associate members, including the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories, to participate, subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, in special sessions of the Assembly to review and appraise the implementation of the programmes of action of those United Nations conferences in which the Territories originally participated as observers, and in the work of the Economic and Social Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa15">Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some Territories by some specialized agencies and programmes and United Nations and regional institutions, the Special Committee recommended that these and other international organizations take measures to accelerate progress in the social and economic life in the Territories. The Committee paid special attention to the problems related to the impact of the international financial regulations on the relevant sectors of the economy of the Territories and to seeking mutually acceptable ways of cooperation in this field.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa16">In 2000, the Special Committee continued to examine the question of military activities in Non-Self-Governing Territories. It reaffirmed its strong conviction that the existence of military activities and installations in Non-Self-Governing Territories could constitute an obstacle to the exercise of self-determination. It urged administering Powers to take all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in any offensive acts or acts of interference against other States. It reiterated that the Territories or adjacent areas should not be used for nuclear tests, dumping nuclear waste or deploying nuclear weapons. Furthermore, it deplored the continued alienation of land, particularly in the small island Territories of the Pacific and the Caribbean, for military installations. The Committee took note of the decision of some administering Powers to downsize their military presence in Non-Self-Governing Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa17">Regarding the dissemination of information on decolonization, the Special Committee reiterated the importance of this activity and remained mindful of the role of public opinion in effectively assisting the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories to achieve self-determination, including the role of non-governmental organizations. Consequently, it proposed that the General Assembly request the Department of Political Affairs and the Department of Public Information to continue their efforts in this regard through all available media, including publications, radio and television, as well as through the Internet.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa18">During last year, the Special Committee continued to monitor and examine the situation in each Territory under its mandate and to hold hearings at which it considered the views of representatives of the Territories, non-governmental organizations and other experts. As noted earlier, part III of the Special Committee's report contains its complete recommendations to the General Assembly regarding individual Territories. I refer members to the relevant section of the report, while highlighting here some selected recommendations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa19">With respect to New Caledonia, the Special Committee welcomed certain progress, including steps leading towards closer association of the Territory within the regional and international organizations and urged all parties involved to maintain their dialogue in a spirit of harmony and in the framework of the Matignon and Nouméa Accords, moving towards an act of self-determination which would safeguard the rights of all New Caledonians.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa20">The Special Committee also considered eleven small island Territories: American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guam, Montserrat, Pitcairn, Saint Helena, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands. In general, it continued to reaffirm the responsibilities of the administering Powers under the Charter to promote the economic and social development of the Territories under their administration. The Special Committee took note of the conditions prevailing in the Territories and called upon the administering Powers to undertake specific measures with regard to each Territory. It also called upon the administering Powers to continue to take all measures to counter problems related to drug trafficking, money laundering and other criminal offences.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa21">With regard to Tokelau, the Special Committee noted the firm commitment of the Territory to the development of self-government and to an act of self-determination. It commended Tokelau for its ongoing work in charting a distinctive, constitutional course which reflects its unique traditions and environment. It acknowledged the participation of the Tokelau representative in the Pacific regional seminar and the progress made by this Territory. It also acknowledged the effective and positive role of New Zealand as the administering Power and its commitment to meet its obligations to the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa22">Before concluding, I would like to emphasize that the Special Committee has continued to benefit greatly from the active participation of representatives of territorial Governments, regional inter-governmental bodies and non-governmental organizations, as well as experts and representatives of some administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee. Their contributions have provided invaluable information and insights; their observations and many of their proposals have inevitably and properly been reflected in many of the recommendations of the Special Committee to the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa23">I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Chairman of the Special Committee, Ambassador Peter Donigi, Permanent Representative of Papua New Guinea, for his vision and leadership, and to the Vice-Chairmen of the Committee, Ambassador Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Permanent Representative of Cuba and Mr. Bernard Tanoh-Boutchoué, of Côte d'Ivoire, with whom I have had the pleasure of working during the past year. I should also like to express gratitude to the staff of the Department of Political Affairs and of the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, mainly to Mr. Mohammad Sattar and Ms. Maria Maldonado, whose assistance and support have enabled the Committee to carry out its work smoothly and successfully.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa24">This year marks the end of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. In this regard, the Special Committee has proposed to the General Assembly that it declare the decade 2001 to 2010 as the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. The draft resolution in this connection is also contained in Part III of the Report of the Special Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa25">The Special Committee is determined to work closely with all administering Powers and the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to ascertain the aspirations of the people, on the basis of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa01">I am pleased to address the General Assembly as it begins its consideration of the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa02">For the second year, I have had the distinct privilege of chairing the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. On this occasion, I wish to express gratitude for the confidence held in me to carry out such an important endeavour, which I consider an honour bestowed upon my country, a recognized advocate for decolonization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa03">The report of the Special Committee on its work during the current year, document <a href="../pdf/A-55-23.pdf">A/55/23</a>, has just been introduced by the Rapporteur. It has been an eventful year, during which the Special Committee carried out its responsibilities in compliance with the resolutions of the General Assembly, including the resolution that declared the Decade ending this year as the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa04">The Special Committee has continued its efforts to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with the administering Powers. In order to assist such dialogue, during the year 2000 the Special Committee concluded preparation of a paper of an informal character containing a general work programme which would serve as a starting point for developing specific work programmes for each Territory. These specific work programmes would, in turn, be the bases of discussion with the administering Powers. Although progress in this area has been incipient, the Special Committee expects that the administering Powers will submit their replies and proposals regarding American Samoa and Pitcairn as soon as possible, including proposals on the modalities of the participation of representatives of the people in the Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa05">The International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, which comes to an end this year, has provided a political framework for concerted activities to speed up the decolonization process. In this connection, I should like to commend to the attention of the membership the overview of the activities taken during the Decade, which may be found in the thoughtful report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Decade.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa06">Despite the efforts made to bring about the eradication of colonialism, the decolonization process is not over, nor can it be over as long as there are Non-Self-Governing Territories to which the Declaration applies. The persistence of colonialism has to be met with determined action to eliminate it. The Special Committee is thus recommending to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution declaring a second Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. By the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would call upon Member States to redouble their efforts to implement the plan of action prepared by the Secretary-General and set out in his report of 13 December 1991, in document <a href="../pdf/A-46-634-Rev.1.pdf">A/46/634/Rev.1</a>. The draft resolution is contained in Part III of the report of the Special Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa07">I should also like to introduce for consideration and support a draft resolution on the "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.58.pdf">A/55/L.58</a>. It is my honour to announce that, since the publication of this draft resolution, the following countries have become sponsors: Cuba, Syrian Arab Republic, Nauru and Solomon Islands. It is generally similar to the resolution adopted by the Assembly at its previous session. However, it varies in some respects. I shall endeavour to give the members a detailed overview of its contents.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa08">By the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly -- while reaffirming its resolution 1514 (XV) containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and other resolutions and decisions on decolonization -- would refer to the end of the first International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism and to a proclamation of a second International Decade, beginning in the year 2001 and ending in 2010.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa09">The draft resolution reaffirms that the existence of colonialism is incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations, the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in it the Assembly would reaffirm its determination to bring about the complete and speedy eradication of colonialism. The draft resolution affirms once again the General Assembly's support for the aspirations of the peoples under colonial rule to exercise their right to self-determination, including independence, in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions on decolonization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Regarding the ongoing efforts by the Special Committee to engage the administering Powers in continuing dialogue, the draft resolution contains a provision by which the Assembly would call upon the administering Powers to cooperate fully with the Special Committee to finalize, before the end of the year 2001, a constructive programme of work on an case-by-case basis for the Non-Self-Governing Territories to facilitate the implementation of the mandate of the Special Committee and the relevant resolutions on decolonization, including in this respect the resolutions on specific territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Operative paragraph 8 of this draft resolution contains special provisions relating to the programme of work of the Special Committee. The Assembly would request the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration; to formulate specific proposals to bring about an end to colonialism; to examine the implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions on decolonization; to pay special attention to the small Territories, including through the dispatch of visiting missions; and to finalize before the end of 2001 a constructive programme of work on a case-by-case basis for the Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa12">The Assembly would also request the Special Committee to take all necessary steps to enlist worldwide support among Governments and national and international organizations for the achievement of the objectives of the Declaration and the implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions; to conduct seminars for the purpose of receiving and disseminating information and to facilitate participation by the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in those seminars; and to observe annually the Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa13">The draft resolution also contains a call for all States, particularly the administering Powers, as well as the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, to give effect within their spheres of competence to the recommendations of the Special Committee for the implementation of the Declaration and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa14">In the draft resolution the Assembly would also call upon the administering Powers to ensure that all economic activities in the Territories under their administration do not adversely affect the interests of the peoples but instead promote development, and it would urge the administering Powers to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable rights of the peoples of the Territories to their natural resources.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa15">By the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would reiterate that military activities and arrangements by administering Powers in the Territories should not run counter to the rights and interests of the peoples of the Territories, especially their right to self-determination. It would call upon the administering Powers concerned to terminate such activities and to eliminate the remaining military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, and would further call upon the administering Powers to promote alternative sources of livelihood for the people of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. This later addition to this paragraph addresses the economic vacuum which may be created as a result of the downsizing and subsequent closure of military bases in those Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa16">The Assembly would urge all States, directly and through their action in the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, to provide moral and material assistance to the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. Also in this connection, it would request the Secretary-General, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to provide economic, social and other assistance to the Territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa17">The draft resolution also contains a provision reaffirming that United Nations visiting missions to the Territories are an effective means of ascertaining the situation in the Territories, as well as the wishes and aspirations of their inhabitants. In this regard, the Assembly would call on the administering Powers to cooperate with the Special Committee and to facilitate visiting missions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa18">In this connection, I must add that, in my personal capacity as representative of Papua New Guinea, I have been privileged to visit two Non-Self-Governing Territories. My visit to New Caledonia, as head of a visiting mission comprising countries of the Pacific region, at the invitation of the administering Power, proved to be invaluable in every respect, since it gave the members of the mission an opportunity to learn first-hand about the Territory, its peoples and its political and socio-economic realities and gave the members insight into the challenges the Territory confronts in its quest for self-determination. The report of this particular mission is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-54-921.pdf">A/54/921</a>, dated 16 June 2000.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa19">My other visit, to Guam, was of an informal nature, on a stopover to the Marshall Islands, where the Special Committee held its regional seminar. I respectfully submit that, although the reports prepared by the Secretariat about the Territories are informative and useful, a visiting mission offers opportunities for interaction that are unique and can only help the decolonization process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa20">The draft resolution I have just introduced is the product of consultations that have been carried out in an open and transparent manner with interested delegations, including the European Union and the administering Powers. Efforts were made to take into account the views of the Member States participating in the consultations and to address their concerns. Though such efforts may not have succeeded in accommodating all the views, the spirit of cooperation that has characterized these consultations must be noted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa21">Before concluding, I should like to express to the Secretary-General, on behalf of the Special Committee, our appreciation for his having provided the necessary substantive and technical support required for the Committee's work and our satisfaction with the quality of the assistance rendered by the Secretariat. The capacity of the Special Committee to carry out its work is strengthened by the timeliness and reliability of the information and advice provided by the Secretariat on the various issues on the Committee's agenda. I commend especially the Secretary of the Committee, Mr. Sattar, and his staff in the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, and Ms. Maria Maldonado of the Decolonization Unit of the Department of Political Affairs and her staff.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa22">I wish also to thank the members of my Bureau for how they cooperated and contributed to the effectiveness of the Special Committee by attending to some issues when I was not personally available to address them. I make special mention of Ambassador Bruno Parrilla, the Permanent Representative of Cuba, and his Deputy, Ambassador Rafael Dausá; Mr. Bernard Tanoh-Boutchoué of the Mission of Côte d'Ivoire; and the Rapporteur of the Special Committee, Mr. Fayssal Mekdad of the Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa23">As this may be the last time I will address the Assembly in my current capacity as the Chairman of the Special Committee, I wish also to thank the members of the Special Committee who have persevered with my leadership over the last two years and who have committed their time and energy to explore new ways of dealing with our specific mandate. This of course does not mean that in the future Papua New Guinea will vacate its responsibilities as a member of the Committee. We will continue to participate in the work of the Committee and pledge ourselves to work closely with the new Chairman to try to complete the work begun under our leadership for the development of the work programmes for each Non-Self-Governing Territory on a case-by-case basis.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa24">I commend to the Assembly draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.58.pdf">A/55/L.58</a>, on the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as a steadfast expression of the commitment of the international community to the unconditional eradication of colonialism from the face of the Earth.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Lewis" nation="Antigua and Barbuda" language="">
	Mr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I speak on behalf of the 14 members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and as such I have the honour to address the Assembly on issues of decolonization under agenda item 18 and items related to this question. CARICOM continues to have a special interest in the interrelated issues of self-determination and decolonization, especially as it relates to the seven remaining small island Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Atlantic/ Caribbean region: namely Bermuda, Turks and Caicos Islands, Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, Anguilla and Montserrat.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa02">CARICOM intensified its role in examining the future socio-economic, political and constitutional development of these Territories throughout the first International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. This role is pursuant to the United Nations Charter and is consistent with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. Our heightened interest is in clear recognition of the obvious fact that the Caribbean territories and their people are integral components of the Caribbean region. Their political and socio-economic development has a direct bearing on Caribbean regional integration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Accordingly, CARICOM member States welcome the continued participation of the elected Governments of most of these Non-Self-Governing Territories as associate members or observers in CARICOM itself, and take note of the expressed interest of others in joining our regional grouping. Many of these territories are active members of associated CARICOM institutions as well, including the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency, the Caribbean Development Bank, the University of the West Indies and others, along with other regional bodies such as the Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee and the Caribbean Council for Science and Technology. Several of the small Territories share a common currency with fraternal eastern Caribbean independent States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa04">CARICOM member States are intricately involved in the continuing recovery efforts in the Territory of Montserrat, whose people have been suffering the effects of the social and economic crisis brought on that beleaguered island by the volcanic eruption there. We continue to provide sustained humanitarian assistance and temporary refuge for those escaping that natural disaster. CARICOM member States continue to participate in regional and international coordination efforts to assist those Montserratians who are returning to their homeland by facilitating the construction of housing in the areas of the country designated as safe zones.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa05">Within the framework of the wider United Nations system, CARICOM States in 1992 devised the mechanism for the inclusion of those Caribbean Non-Self-Governing Territories which enjoy associate membership in the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean as official observers to the various United Nations world conferences in the social and economic sphere. As a result of these efforts, Caribbean Non-Self-Governing Territories have participated in the United Nations world conferences on environment and development, the sustainable development of small island developing States, population, social development, human settlements, natural disaster reduction, and women and development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa06">CARICOM continues to support United Nations resolutions and other initiatives in this regard in recognition of the importance of these activities to the development process of the Territories and in implementation of the longstanding mandates contained in resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Economic and Social Council, confirming that the participation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in the wider United Nations system facilitates the process of decolonization. Just as important, this participation serves to provide these Territories with important points of reference in addressing international issues of direct relevance and impact to their socio-economic development process, consistent with the need for these Territories to develop their capacity to compete in an increasingly globalized world, which threatens to marginalize small island developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa07">CARICOM takes this opportunity to express our gratitude to the States members of the General Assembly for continuing to facilitate the participation of the small island Territories in the international process through these observer status and associate membership mechanisms, and to call for the accelerated use of these features in the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa08">As we come to the close of the first International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, declared by the General Assembly in its <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-43-47.pdf">resolution 43/47</a> of 22 November 1988 and in its companion <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf">resolution 46/181</a> of 19 December 1991, which approved a Plan of Action for that period, it is clear that the level of implementation of that Plan is less than we originally expected. The most meaningful provisions of that Plan were not carried out and priority actions, such as the creation of political education to heighten the awareness of the people of the Territories and the visits to each of the Territories by the Secretary-General or his Special Representative, were never undertaken. Further, the two critical analyses of the constitutional, political and economic development of the Territories, vital to a systematic and complete assessment by the international community of the prevailing conditions in these Territories, were not carried out.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa09">The failure to implement these and other important actions in furtherance of the decolonization process continues to puzzle CARICOM member States, given the amount of political energy and resources historically devoted to self-determination and decolonization, resulting in some of the major successful initiatives of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa10">Between the concerted action leading to the attainment of full self-determination by Namibia at the beginning of the 1990s and the steadfast commitment to the nation-building exercise initiated at the end of the 1990s in East Timor, there has been an insufficient effort to address the self-determination needs of the small island Territories. It is therefore necessary to reinvigorate the decolonization process for the small island Territories through a comprehensive plan of action for the second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism to complete the work left undone in the Plan of Action of the first Decade. Certainly, this is an achievable goal if the requisite human and financial resources of the United Nations system are utilized to address this unfinished business.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa11">In this context, member States can build upon the foundation created by the recommendations of the regional seminars convened annually since 1990, alternately in the Caribbean and Pacific. Such recommendations include the importance of a fair and unbiased political education programme for the people of the Territories regarding their legitimate political options of equality; increased cooperation between the United Nations and regional institutions in furtherance of the self-determination process, as has been seen with the South Pacific Forum as relates to New Caledonia; the establishment of an expert group comprised of representatives of the Territories to articulate their concerns and interests; the annual preparation of a status report on the implementation of decolonization resolutions; and the implementation of the studies and analyses called for in the first Plan of Action.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa12">These recommendations of the peoples of the Territories themselves should be integrated into the plan of action of the second International Decade. Had they been included in the first Plan of Action -- and implemented -- the process of self-determination would have been much further along at this late stage, when many continue to ponder the question of why this issue is still with us as we approach the new millennium.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa13">In this connection, CARICOM wishes to reiterate its long-held position that the decolonization process has not been completed, but rather requires unique remedies for protecting the inalienable rights of the people of the Territories, and in particular those small island Territories which require special consideration as a result of the vulnerabilities that they share with other small island developing countries in their respective regions. It is these unique remedies, consistent with adherence to international principles of political equality and with the maximum possible participation of the representatives of the Territories themselves, that the international community must focus upon if the work of the United Nations in decolonization in the twenty-first century is to be successful.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa14">We take some encouragement from the developments over the last year within the framework of the Committee of 24, resulting in a process of informal consultation between the Committee and representatives of the Territories themselves, and from the fact that the administering Powers contributed to important clarifications on the often intricate dynamics of the remaining dependency arrangements. We urge the relevant administering Powers to resume their formal cooperation with the Committee of 24, which has gone the extra mile, and beyond, since the thaw of the cold war by streamlining its work; by reducing what some considered to be contentious language in its resolutions; by focusing more attention on socio-economic development issues in the Territories; by reducing its budgetary requests. almost to a fault; by acquiescing to substantial reorganizations of the secretarial services provided to it; and by eliminating its only two subcommittees, among other measures taken, all for the purpose of addressing the concerns articulated a decade and a half ago that precipitated the withdrawal of several administering Powers from cooperation with the Committee in the first instance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa15">It is now time for a reciprocal show of goodwill so that the Committee can resume its work in earnest, with all the stakeholders at the table -- the Member States, the administering Powers and the representatives of the people of the Territories themselves. The existing informal and closed dialogue between the Committee of 24 and the administering Powers should now quickly evolve into the resumption of formal, open and transparent discussions in formal meetings of the Committee. That is the best chance for this process to move forward.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa16">Within this context, CARICOM wishes to reaffirm its unwavering support for the long-standing principles of complete and absolute equality as the operational guide in achieving innovative and flexible solutions to the decolonization of the remaining small island Territories, through the three legitimate options for political status: independence, free association or integration with full political rights, as defined in General Assembly resolution 1541 (XV). Small island Territories have no less right to political equality than other Territories that have been decolonized before them. Until the existing unequal dependency arrangements that remain inconsistent with full political equality are addressed, there will be a need for continuing oversight by the United Nations. CARICOM intends to play its rightful role in that oversight, especially as it relates to the small island Territories of our beloved Caribbean region.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa01">Significant achievements have been made by the United Nations in the area of decolonization since the adoption, in 1960, of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The current world map does not look anything like the one the founders of the Organization had before them. There is no doubt that the decolonization process has been one of the greatest victories of the United Nations. However, when 10 years ago we set the goal of being free from colonialism by the twenty-first century, we could not have imagined that, at the end of the first International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, we were going to be faced with the bitter reality of still having 17 Territories under colonial domination; or that, in all that time, real progress in the decolonization process was going to be minimal. It is truly unjustifiable, in a world that has supposedly moved from confrontation to cooperation, that there are still peoples that suffer the horrors of colonialism and that there continue to be administering Powers that refuse to cooperate with the decolonizing work begun by the United Nations and the bodies established to that end.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa02">We are once again faced with discriminatory theories that try to justify the unjustifiable colonial status of some Territories by putting forward fatalistic arguments that would doom those Territories to live forever under the colonial yoke. We once again reiterate our strong conviction that the inalienable right to self-determination and independence of peoples under colonial domination must be respected by all, regardless of the size of a given Territory, its geographical location, the number of its citizens or the amount of natural resources it has. It is also unacceptable that some Powers are trying to deprive Territories under colonization of their right to independence while insisting on speaking solely of the right to self-determination, as if the right to self-determination could be divorced from the exercise of independence. Likewise, it is unacceptable that some are even trying to distort the right to self-determination by using new formulas or simply by changing the name of the Territories under their domination.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa03">The Special Committee on Decolonization has periodically reviewed its working methods over the years with the basic aim of making its work increasingly effective and efficient. Regrettably, the effectiveness and results of the Special Committee's work do not depend solely on the will and efforts of its members. The cooperation of the administering Powers is a vitally important element for any progress we wish to make in the decolonizing effort.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa04">While it is encouraging that in recent months administering Powers have maintained an informal dialogue with the Special Committee -- especially some Powers that had not previously done so -- we continue to be concerned by the continuing reluctance to consolidate and make that dialogue official. Despite the constructive spirit and the willingness to engage in dialogue with which the Special Committee has approached its work in an effort to involve the administering Powers, the facts make it impossible for us to deny reality. Some administering Powers continue to refuse to establish an official and serious relationship with the Special Committee and are attempting to create as many hurdles as possible for our work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Despite the fact that visiting missions are an ideal mechanism for obtaining first-hand information about the economic, political and social situation in a Territory, it is now difficult to recall the last time that such a mission actually went to a Non-Self-Governing Territory. Some administering Powers even continue to fail to convey in a timely manner requisite information about the Territories under their domination, as is clearly called for in Article 73 of the Charter of the United Nations. Some administering Powers also continue to carry out military activities in the Territories under their domination, to the detriment of the rights and interests of the peoples affected; and some administering Powers continue to irrationally exploit the natural resources of Non-Self-Governing Territories, in flagrant violation of General Assembly resolution 2621 (XXV).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Cuba once again reaffirms its commitment to the independence and self-determination of its sister nation of Puerto Rico. Although it has been under the colonial yoke for over 100 years, Puerto Rico has not lost one iota of its identity as a nation of Latin American and the Caribbean. The colonial Power employs every sort of manoeuvre to confuse international public opinion and distort the economic, political and social reality of Puerto Rico. However, there is only one reality: Puerto Rico continues to be deprived of its legitimate right to self-determination and to exist as a sovereign and independent nation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa07">Cuba strongly supports the proclamation of a second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism as a way of showing the international community the high priority accorded by the United Nations to decolonization activities, and as a mechanism to provide the necessary continuity to the work carried out over all these years.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa08">At the threshold of the twenty-first century, the goal of a world without colonialism will have to wait a little longer to be fulfilled. Though we cannot say that there has not been any progress in recent times; yet the results are regrettably very far short of our expectations and, above all, of the expectations of the Territories living under colonial domination, which desire to be able to exercise their right to freedom, sovereignty and independence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa09">The draft resolution before us, which our delegation will support, attempts to reflect that desire, and the hope that, sooner rather than later, the scourge of colonialism, with all of its accompanying blights, will disappear from the face of the earth.</div>

	Mr. Carlot (Vanuatu)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk01-pa01">As a Melanesian and Pacific country, the Republic of Vanuatu is deeply concerned about the continuing and escalating violation of human rights against the indigenous people of West Papua.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk01-pa02">We are further concerned that the international community -- which is increasingly putting a lot of pressure on our countries, which have small and vulnerable economies, to observe the principles of transparency and human rights standards -- seems oblivious of the sufferings of our Melanesian brothers and sisters in West Papua. The illegal crossing of the border between West Papua and Papua New Guinea is a concern that we fully appreciate and share. We also well appreciate that the illegal movement across this long border, and the resulting refugee population, will only increase with escalating tension and violence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk01-pa03">In October 2000 the Pacific Islands Forum leaders expressed deep concern about past and present violence and loss of life in West Papua. They called on the Government of Indonesia, as the sovereign authority, and on the secessionist groups to resolve their differences peacefully through dialogue and consultation. The Pacific Islands Forum leaders urged all parties to protect and uphold the human rights of all residents of West Papua. Vanuatu is committed to this collective plea for peace and respect for human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk01-pa04">With respect to decolonization and the granting of independence to colonies and Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Republic of Vanuatu takes the firm view that the United Nations played a direct role in the conclusion of the 1962 New York Agreement and in the resulting so-called referendum in 1969. This process led to the volatile and difficult situation the world is watching today. On that basis, the United Nations has a moral and legal duty to facilitate a review of those earlier undertakings in the interests of all the people of the region, in particular the people of West Papua.</div>

</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk02-pa01">For its part, Vanuatu implores Indonesia, as the sovereign authority pursuant to the relevant United Nations mandate, to exercise its goodwill and diplomatic acumen and give due consideration to the ultimate placing of West Papua on the decolonization list for future appropriate action by the Committee of 24. My Government stands ready to cooperate and assist in this process of negotiation and diplomacy with Indonesia and other interested Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk02-pa02">Secondly, the information received on West Papua comes predominantly from media organizations and pro-independence groups. Official reports are therefore very scarce, and they provide to the world a very sketchy picture of the atrocities, the refugee situation and other critical factors in this crisis.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk02-pa03">On that basis, Vanuatu calls on this Assembly, with the concurrence of Indonesia, to recommend to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to initiate a visiting human rights mission or send an envoy to West Papua. A report by such a mission would illuminate further dialogue or negotiation within the United Nations on the critical situation, or otherwise, in West Papua.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk02-pa04">Recent history teaches us that over two decades of atrocities in East Timor have been wanton and wasteful, and they continue to absorb the scarce resources of the United Nations and its Member States. Hopefully, global consciousness today will awaken us to the need to avoid another East Timor in West Papua.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk02-pa05">Vanuatu is confident that the values and principles of the United Nations Charter can be upheld meaningfully against today's difficult challenges. The new millennium offers a unique opportunity that we, the United Nations, cannot afford to miss, and must not miss, to find a lasting solution that will safeguard global peace and security and the identity of the people of West Papua.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk02-pa06">Today, as we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the granting of independence to colonies and territories, we must remain forward-looking and aspire to a world of true decolonization in the not-too-distant future.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa01">I have the honour to introduce the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) to the General Assembly for its consideration and approval. These reports refer to each of the 12 items allocated to the Fourth Committee by the General Assembly. They indicate the documents that were made available for its consideration and contain the texts of the resolutions and decisions on which it took action.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa02">The Fourth Committee considered the items on its agenda separately, with the exception of matters pertaining to the Non-Self-Governing Territories and related issues, on which it held one single general debate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa03">Throughout its session during the first part of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the Committee held a total of 28 meetings. It should be noted that the Committee made every effort to conclude its business within the allocated time frame, while utilizing the resources made available to it as efficiently as possible. However, it was necessary to extend the session of the Committee and to frequently reschedule meetings, due chiefly to the unavailability of a document, as well as to the special need arising this year from the consideration of the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, otherwise referred to as the Brahimi report, by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa04">The Fourth Committee adopted 26 draft resolutions and three draft decisions, of which 14 draft resolutions and two draft decisions were adopted by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa05">The first report, submitted under agenda item 82, "Effects of atomic radiation", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-568.pdf">A/55/568</a>. The Fourth Committee this year considered an extensive report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), which covers its work during the forty-fourth through forty-ninth sessions. It should be noted that two delegations voiced substantial concern about the content of the UNSCEAR report and proposed amendments to the draft resolution that the Fourth Committee had before it. After extensive consultations among interested delegations, it was possible to arrive at the text of the draft resolution contained in paragraph 11 of the report, which was adopted by consensus by the Fourth Committee. In this draft resolution, the General Assembly, among other things, notes with appreciation the work of UNSCEAR and the release of its extensive report; endorses its intentions and plans for future scientific review and assessment activities; and invites it to continue its consultations with scientists and experts from interested Member States in preparing future scientific reports. On behalf of the Fourth Committee, I commend this draft resolution for adoption by the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa06">The second report, relating to agenda item 83, "International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-569.pdf">A/55/569</a>. During the debate on this agenda item, the Fourth Committee took note of the interest of several countries in becoming full members of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Another important aspect of the discussions in the Fourth Committee was how to ensure the implementation of the recommendations contained in the resolution entitled "The Space Millennium: Vienna Declaration on Space and Human Development," adopted by the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa07">As part of its work, the Committee established an open-ended working group which, under the chairmanship of the delegation of Chile, formulated the draft resolution contained in paragraph 12 of the report. After several meetings and extensive informal consultations among interested parties, this draft resolution was adopted by the Fourth Committee by consensus. Among other things, it requests the Secretary-General to begin implementing those measures and activities that are contained in the plan of action for implementing the recommendations of UNISPACE III and that are currently within the programme of work of the Office for Outer Space Affairs, and also to ensure the full implementation of the plan with the necessary resources in 2002. On behalf of the Fourth Committee, I recommend this draft resolution to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa08">The third report, issued as document <a href="../pdf/A-55-570.pdf">A/55/570</a>, refers to agenda item 84, "United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East". The Fourth Committee took note of the fact that it had been more than 50 years since the establishment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). In that context, it recognized the important function the Agency has been performing since its establishment to improve the living conditions of Palestine refugees, and it reiterated its concern at the persistent critical financial situation of the Agency. The Committee adopted seven draft resolutions on various aspects of the mandate of UNRWA. These draft resolutions appear in paragraph 22 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends to the General Assembly that it adopt these draft resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa09">The fourth report, referring to agenda item 85, "Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-571.pdf">A/55/571</a>. The Committee considered the report of the Special Committee concerning the protection and promotion of the human rights of the Palestinian people and other Arab inhabitants of the occupied territories. The vast majority of delegations speaking under this agenda item expressed support and appreciation for the activities of the Special Committee. However, it should also be noted that several delegations, including one that spoke on behalf of a group of countries, expressed concern about the nature of the activities of the Special Committee. On this subject, the Committee adopted five draft resolutions, to be found in paragraph 20 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends these draft resolutions to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa10">The fifth report, relating to agenda item 86, entitled "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects", appears in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-572.pdf">A/55/572</a>. The Fourth Committee received and considered a mid-term report by Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations on the implementation by the Secretariat of the recommendations of the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. In parallel with and following the debate on this agenda item in the Fourth Committee, at the extraordinary session of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations its working group considered extensively the Brahimi report and its associated documents. The outcome of this consideration was reported to the Fourth Committee, as reflected in this report. The Fourth Committee recommends the draft resolution that appears in paragraph 11 of this report for adoption by the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa11">The sixth report, submitted under item 87, entitled "Questions relating to information", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-573.pdf">A/55/573</a>. After hearing a comprehensive introductory statement by Under-Secretary-General Hogen of the Department of Public Information, the Committee stressed the central role of public information in projecting a strong image of the United Nations and promoting a proper understanding of its work. Furthermore, in the light of the rapid developments in the area of information technology, it underscored the need to explore possibilities for cooperation in the spheres of information and communications so that their benefits can be shared by all the peoples of the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa12">After considering the report submitted to it by the Committee on Information, the Fourth Committee adopted two draft resolutions and one draft decision. The latter, when adopted by the General Assembly, will increase the membership of the Committee on Information by two countries and appoint Armenia and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya as new members. The draft resolutions are contained in paragraph 10 of the report and the draft decision in paragraph 11. The Special Political and Decolonization Committee recommends that the General Assembly adopt both draft resolutions and the draft decision.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa13">With regard to the items on Non-Self-Governing Territories and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples -- agenda items 18, 88, 89, 90 and 12, and 91, which were considered together -- the Fourth Committee considered the degree of implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, bearing in mind that this year marks the end of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. It recognized the important contribution of the United Nations to decolonization and reaffirmed its commitment to continue to take the necessary measures for the advent of a world free from colonialism in the twenty-first century. In this context, many delegations voiced support for the need for a second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, bearing in mind that the objectives of the first decade were not fully achieved, as reflected in the draft resolution on which the General Assembly will be taking action shortly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa14">On these items, the General Assembly has before it a number of reports. The report on agenda item 88, entitled "Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 <i>e</i> of the Charter of the United Nations", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-574.pdf">A/55/574</a>. The draft resolution on this item appears in paragraph 8 of the report, and the Fourth Committee recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa15">The report relating to agenda items 89 and 18, entitled, respectively, "Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories" and "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-575.pdf">A/55/575</a>. Under these two items, the Committee adopted one draft resolution and one draft decision. The Fourth Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the draft resolution and the draft decision, which are contained in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the report, respectively.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa16">With regard to agenda items 90 and 12, entitled, respectively, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations" and "Report of the Economic and Social Council", the report of the Fourth Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-576.pdf">A/55/576</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa17">On these issues, the Committee adopted one draft resolution, which is contained in paragraph 9 of the report, and recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa18">The report relating to agenda item 91, entitled "Offers by Member States of study and training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories", has been issued as document <a href="../pdf/A-55-577.pdf">A/55/577</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa19">Paragraph 6 of that document contains the text of a draft resolution adopted by the Fourth Committee, which it recommends to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa20">The report issued under item 18, entitled "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", appears in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-578.pdf">A/55/578</a>, which contains the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to specific Territories not covered by other agenda items. In this context, the Committee adopted five draft resolutions, including a draft omnibus resolution covering 11 Territories, and one draft decision. The draft resolutions are contained in paragraph 24 of the report and the draft decision in paragraph 25. The Fourth Committee recommends the draft resolutions and the draft decision to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa21">Before I conclude, I should like to stress the high level of cooperation prevailing in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, which enabled it to achieve satisfactory results and complete its work effectively and constructively. In this context, I should like to express, on behalf of the Bureau of the Fourth Committee, our profound appreciation to those delegations which coordinated the draft resolutions adopted by the Committee. I should also like to thank all delegations that participated in the efforts to reach consensus and, when this was not possible, to narrow the differences among interested parties. All such contributions were made with a prevailing spirit of cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa22">I would be remiss if I failed to pay tribute to the work carried out by the Chairman of the Committee, Ambassador Matia Mulumba Semakula Kiwanuka of Uganda, which made it possible for the Committee to consider in depth all the agenda items allocated to it by the General Assembly, despite the wide-ranging and often difficult issues it had to address. The Vice-Chairpersons -- Ambassador Lewis of Antigua and Barbuda, Ms. Poli of Croatia and Mr. Vassallo of Malta, with whom I had the pleasure of working, also contributed to our success.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa23">I should also like to express my appreciation for the able cooperation of Mr. Mohammad Sattar, the Secretary of the Committee, and the competent team from the Secretariat that assisted him. All of them helped organize and ensure that the work of the Committee was carried out in an atmosphere of genuine cordiality.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk06-pa24">I have the honour to submit to the General Assembly for its consideration and adoption the recommendations of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee contained in the reports to which I have referred.</div>

	Mr. Eldon (United Kingdom)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa01">I am taking the floor to explain the United Kingdom's votes on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-147.pdf">resolution 55/147</a>, on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-145.pdf">resolution 55/145</a>, on the dissemination of information on decolonization, and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-146.pdf">resolution 55/146</a>, on the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa02">As members of the Assembly will have seen, we voted against all of these resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa03">On the resolution on the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the United Kingdom continues to find some elements of this text unacceptable. These include, but are not limited to, operative paragraph 12, which calls on the administering Powers to eliminate the remaining military bases in the Non-Self-Governing Territories. This language is drawn from the decision on military activities, which we also voted against this year.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa04">With regard to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-145.pdf">resolution 55/145</a>, the United Kingdom remains of the view that the obligation which this text places on the Secretariat to publicize decolonization issues represents an unwarranted drain on the scarce resources of the United Nations. The resolution is therefore unacceptable.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa05">Finally, my delegation has a few comments on the resolution on the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. We have read carefully the Secretary-General's report on the first Decade and take the view that there is scant evidence in it that the activities of the Decade were of any great benefit to the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. In contrast, we are firmly of the opinion that the interests of those peoples are more likely to be furthered through the informal dialogue of administering Powers with the Committee of 24, which falls outside the activities mandated by this resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa06">We are thus concerned that the activities of the first Decade have not been an efficient use of United Nations resources. Moreover, no plan of action for the second Decade has yet been submitted, and we are therefore unaware of what implications it may have for the handling of decolonization issues in general or for particular United Kingdom territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa07">We cannot support a request to provide resources for as yet unspecified activities; nor would we support a request to renew activities which have failed to achieve their objectives in the past.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa08">Despite our negative votes on these resolutions, the United Kingdom delegation remains sincerely committed to furthering the process of informal dialogue with the Committee of 24 over the coming year. We look forward to working in a constructive and cooperative spirit in order to take forward the development of programmes of work on individual United Kingdom territories, with a view to their eventual de-listing from the Committee's agenda.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa09">Finally, with your permission Mr. President, and to save some time, I should like to say a few words in right of reply to the remarks on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands made this morning by the representative of Chile, on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group of States, under this agenda item during the observance of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg037-bk02-pa10">The United Kingdom's position on this issue is well known. It was most recently set out in full in my right of reply to the statement by the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina to the General Assembly on 21 September.</div>
