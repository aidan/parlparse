<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of 27 ad litem judges of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, for a four-year term of office commencing on the day of the completion of this election.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">By its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1329(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1329 (2000)</a> of 30 November 2000, the Security Council decided to establish a pool of ad litem judges of the International Tribunal. To that end, it decided to amend articles 12, 13 and 14 of the Statute of the International Tribunal. In that resolution, the Security Council further requested the Secretary-General to make practical arrangements for the election, as soon as possible, of 27 ad litem judges, in accordance with article 13 ter, of the Statute of the International Tribunal as so amended.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa03">In connection with the election today of the 27 ad litem judges, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa04">First, in accordance with article 13 ter, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Tribunal as amended by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1329(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1329 (2000)</a>, the 27 ad litem judges of the International Tribunal shall be elected by the General Assembly from a list of candidates submitted by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa05">At its 4316th meeting, on 27 April 2001, the Security Council, in accordance with article 13 ter, subparagraph 1 (c), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, established in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1350(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1350 (2001)</a> a list of 64 candidates, taking due account of adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the world and bearing in mind the importance of equitable geographical distribution. The list was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by a letter dated 27 April 2001 from the President of the Security Council. The letter was issued as <a href="../pdf/A-55-917.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/917</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa06">Secondly, in accordance with article 13 ter, subparagraph 1 (d), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, the Holy See and Switzerland, the two non-member States maintaining Permanent Observer Missions at United Nations Headquarters will participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. On this occasion, I am happy to welcome here the representatives of the Holy See and Switzerland.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa07">Finally, I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning the election of judges of the International Tribunal is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-918.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/918</a> and addendum 1.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa08">The list of 64 candidates can be found in paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/A-55-918.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/918</a>, and the 8 withdrawals can be found in addendum 1 to that document. Therefore at present there are 56 candidates.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa09">The curricula vitae of the candidates are contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-919.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/919</a> and addenda 1 and 2. In that connection, may I bring to Members' attention the provision of article 13 of the Statute of the International Tribunal as amended, which reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa10">"The permanent and ad litem judges shall be persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices. In the overall composition of the Chambers and sections of the Trial Chambers, due account shall be taken of the experience of the judges in criminal law, international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law."</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa11">As representatives are aware, the election of judges will take place in accordance with the relevant provisions of article 13 ter of the Statute of the International Tribunal. In addition, given the similar nature of the election of judges of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the International Tribunal, it was decided at the time of the election of judges in 1993, 1997, 1998 and 2001 to follow similar election procedures in the General Assembly. In his memorandum, the Secretary-General suggests that these precedents be applied to the election of ad litem judges of the International Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa12">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to that suggestion?</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg002-bk01">
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">It was so decided.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">In accordance with article 13 ter, subparagraph 1 (d), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, as amended, the candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the two non-member States shall be declared elected.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose, are all 189 Member States and the two non-member States, namely, the Holy See and Switzerland. Accordingly, 96 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of electing judges of the International Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">If in the first ballot the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than 27, a second ballot will be held and balloting will continue, in the same meeting, until 27 candidates have obtained an absolute majority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">Following the practice in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, the Secretary-General suggests in his memorandum that any second and subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted -- I repeat, that any second and subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">It is further suggested that, following the practice in the election of the judges of the International Court of Justice, if more than 27 candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will be held on all candidates and balloting will continue, at the same meeting, until 27 candidates, and no more, have obtained an absolute majority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa06">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to the procedure I have just outlined?</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg003-bk01">
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">It was so decided.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Navarrete</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Today, as on all the previous occasions when the General Assembly has met to elect judges of ad hoc international tribunals, Mexico takes the floor to explain the reasons why, since the first such occasion, it has decided not to participate in these elections.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">On all those occasions Mexico, a country committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and to full compliance with the norms of international humanitarian law, has stated that in establishing such tribunals the Security Council went beyond its powers, given that the Charter of the United Nations contains no explicit provision granting the Council the authority to create jurisdictional mechanisms of this nature.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Mexico has also expressed its conviction that once the Statute of the International Criminal Court is in force -- a body whose establishment did follow the norms of international law -- the establishment of new ad hoc tribunals will not be necessary. In addition, Mexico has stated that it will continue to pay in a timely manner its assessed contributions for the funding of those tribunals, strictly abiding by the decisions adopted in this regard by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">This continues to be Mexico's position. Nevertheless, Mexico has taken note of the important contribution the tribunals have made to combating impunity by bringing to justice individuals who have committed serious crimes of international significance, thus ensuring the rule of law. In this connection, the work done by the ad hoc criminal tribunals since their establishment has had undeniable legal effects, establishing international jurisprudence which has made possible the strengthening and development of international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The ad hoc criminal tribunals have played a central role in putting international humanitarian law into practice -- especially with regard to the norms enshrined in the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which constitute the most authoritative expression of international humanitarian law currently in force. By virtue of those Conventions, which Mexico ratified in 1952, the High Contracting Parties committed themselves to respecting, and ensuring respect for, the Conventions in all circumstances, in accordance with their common article 1.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">It is for all these reasons that Mexico will henceforth participate fully in the election of judges for special tribunals, putting the importance of the work done by these legal bodies above its principled reservations with regard to how they were set up. This decision takes effect immediately and has not been previously communicated to the States putting forth candidates for this election.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">The delegation of Mexico has taken various criteria into account in deciding whom to vote for in this election. Among those is the desirability of having the composition of the Tribunal reflect as broadly as possible the diversity of legal systems and traditions in existence throughout the various regions, as well as the principle of gender equality.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Musambachime</span> <span class="nation">Zambia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">I would like to say that I have been instructed to inform the Assembly that the following candidates would like to withdraw their candidacies: Mr. Chifumu Kingdom Banda, Mr. Isaac Chibulu Tantameni Chali and Mr. Mphanza Patrick Mvunga.  There is thus only one Zambian candidate, namely, Ms. Irene Chirwa Mambilima.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Archbishop Martino</span> <span class="non-nation">Holy See</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">The Holy See has attentively followed the proceedings of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">The Holy See regards the Tribunal as an instrument of the international community to express its condemnation of violations of international humanitarian law. Although the Holy See is a non-member State that maintains a permanent observer mission at the United Nations, it nevertheless appreciates that it is invited to participate in the election of ad litem judges to the Tribunal in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations, in accordance with article 13 ter, paragraph 1 (d), of the Statute of the International Tribunal as amended by the Security Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1329(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1329 (2000)</a> of 30 November 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">In this regard, I would like to inform the Assembly that the Holy See, in accordance with the practice in similar cases and for the sake of impartiality, has decided to abstain from casting its vote on the individual candidates for the office of ad litem judge of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa04">The Holy See wishes to reiterate its confidence in the choices that will be made by the international community, and it extends its sincere best wishes to the ad litem judges who will soon be elected to serve the cause of justice and peace in the world.</p>

I would like to inform the Assembly that I have received instructions to announce that Burundi would like to retain only one candidate, namely, Mr. Léopold Ntahompagaze.
