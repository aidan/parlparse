<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guéhenno</span> <span class="non-nation">Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I very much welcome this opportunity to discuss the main challenges facing Kosovo, which the Council was able to experience first hand during its recent visit.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The report of the mission concurs with the views expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on Kosovo which was circulated on 13 June. The report points out that the key challenges are indeed interrelated. They are security, return of refugees and internally displaced persons, the issue of the missing and detainees, confidence-building measures and the holding of Kosovo-wide elections later this year.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The Security Council mission will have seen that the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) is working on all fronts to move forward in all of these areas, particularly to improve the situation of the minority communities and solicit their participation in the UNMIK-led process, which is the key to the success of the democratic process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Today I will not go into too many details; these are amply provided both in the Secretary-General's report and in the report of the Security Council mission. Instead, if I may, I will focus on the main messages that came out of the Council visit and that are crucial for the future development of Kosovo: namely, multi-ethnicity, the engagement of all communities in the political process and confidence-building measures.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">First, how to engage the communities. We were very pleased to see from the findings of the Security Council mission's report that its main message to the representatives of all communities was the need for multi-ethnicity. This was precisely the message I took with me when I visited Kosovo back in April. I then told the members of the Kosovo Albanian leadership that it is the duty of the majority in a democratic process to ensure the rights of the minority communities, and I told the minority communities that the only way to ensure a viable future was through participation in the political process. I shared the view of the Council and Special Representative of the Secretary-General Haekkerup that while the international community can assist in creating conditions conducive to a multi-ethnic Kosovo, it is very much the responsibility of the Kosovars themselves to achieve that goal. I was pleased to see that this message was delivered in such an unequivocal way to those members of the Kosovo leadership with whom the Council mission met.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">As both the Council mission's report and the Secretary-General's report underline, the political engagement of all communities in this process, particularly the Kosovo Serb community, remains a major challenge for UNMIK. This challenge can only be rendered more difficult by the continuing division within the Kosovo Serb community itself.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">We are pleased to note from the Security Council mission's report that the meetings the mission had in Belgrade were held in a very constructive atmosphere. The authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are still concerned about some aspects of the Constitutional Framework, but they accept that the document cannot be changed. Instead, we should be looking at the creation of confidence-building measures vis-à-vis the Kosovo Serb community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">We fully support this, as does the Council in its report. It is essential to move the process forward and elaborate such confidence-building measures in conjunction with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In this regard, we are very pleased to see an increasing dialogue between Special Representative of the Secretary-General Haekkerup and the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is only through consistent and patient dialogue that we will be able to move the process forward.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">As far as the divisions in the Kosovo Serb community are concerned, we believe that the Council mission saw these first hand during its visit. We agree with the assessment of the Council and the Special Representative that the key element in encouraging the participation of the Kosovo Serb community is a clear signal from the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In this regard, we fully support and welcome the message that the Council delivered during its meetings in Belgrade. We would encourage the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to assist in conveying a clear message to the Kosovo Serb community that participation and integration into the structures UNMIK is establishing are indeed in their best interests.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">But this is not a one-way process. We are fully aware, as is the Council, that the Kosovo Serb community has legitimate grievances. UNMIK is addressing these, as highlighted in both reports, and we must ensure that efforts continue and are enhanced to eliminate the root causes of these grievances.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">One of the main challenges in this regard remains the fragile security situation, particularly for the minority communities, as highlighted in the reports. The communities, particularly the Kosovo Serb community, continue to suffer disproportionately from major crimes and ethnically motivated acts of intimidation. These factors continue to undermine UNMIK's efforts to convince the Kosovo Serb community that they will derive tangible benefits from cooperating in the UNMIK-led process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">I would like to say a word on the security situation and the law enforcement initiatives recently taken. We hope in this respect that the recent adoption of several major pieces of legislation will contribute to an improvement of the overall security situation. Namely, these are the entry into force on 4 June of <i>(regulation 2001/10)</i>, on the prohibition of unauthorized border/boundary crossings, and <i>(regulation 2001/7)</i>, on the authorization of possession of weapons in Kosovo. In addition, a week ago today Special Representative Haekkerup signed into law the regulation on the prohibition of terrorism and related offences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">In addition to these three key legislative initiatives, the establishment of the new police and justice pillar in UNMIK will pave the way for a gradual improvement in the law and order situation in Kosovo. I want to note that improvements have already been made, including the excellent police work in cooperation with the Kosovo Force that resulted in the detention, only two days after the attack, of a suspect in the bombing in central Pristina on 18 April. That bombing claimed the life of the head of the passport office of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Committee on Cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">On the issue of returns, progress has also been made, as can be seen from both reports. Although such returns remain minimal, a lot of work continues in the background to identify potential return sites and to develop conditions that will be conducive to the return of Kosovo Serbs. A vital element in this process is the acceptance by the majority population of minority return. In this respect, we very much welcome the acceptance by the Interim Administrative Council of a general statement of principles guiding return, as well as the identification of 10 sites where return is planned to take place later in the year. I would note, however, that although there is clearly an urgent need for demonstrable progress in this area -- and we know that this issue of return is of key symbolic and political importance -- it remains UNMIK's and our firm policy that return should take place in secure and sustainable conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">On the issue of the need for developing more confidence-building measures, I would like to address the issue of Mitrovica. Mitrovica has been identified as a key area for confidence-building in order to dispel the hatred and mutual distrust that still exists on both sides. We welcome the Council's support for efforts to develop a comprehensive strategy to resolve the very complex situation in Mitrovica. Key to the success of such a strategy, as the Council pointed out, is the creation of multi-ethnic initiatives in the social, economic and religious areas to start rebuilding confidence between the communities. At the same time, there is a crucial recognition that Mitrovica is a microcosm of the problems of Kosovo as a whole, and that the correct approach will entail Kosovo-wide confidence-building measures, as well as measures that are specific to the situation in Mitrovica. One area I would highlight in the context of confidence-building measures is the very delicate issue of the missing on all sides. We were pleased to note the Council's recommendation for further progress in this crucial area, which continues to be a major impediment to reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">In conclusion, one of the major benefits of the Council's visit to Kosovo is that there is clear unanimity on the need to move the process forward. As the Council mission noted, the Constitutional Framework represents an important step in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. Moving the process forward on the basis of a broad consensus is essential to combating extremism and encouraging moderates on all sides. This in turn will have a beneficial effect on the security situation and the prospects for return. There is no doubt that participation in the political process is a precondition for progress.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">Positive signals in favour of Kosovo-Serb registration are encouraging, but the Kosovo Serbs must also take part in the elections and take their rightful place in the provisional self-government. Both the Secretary-General and the Council have underlined that the benefits of cooperation are preferable to marginalization. This will, of course, entail risks for all communities and, in particular, for the Kosovo-Serb community. The Council's report puts it well when it says:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk08-pa18">"although the Kosovo Serbs did not want to commit to the political process until the process had produced improvements, the process could not produce results unless the Kosovo Serbs committed to it. The only way out was to accept the structures UNMIK was putting in place and take some risks in working with moderate views on the other side." (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2001-600.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/600</a>, para. 17</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">The Council's mission has succeeded in delivering firm and balanced messages. The United Nations and the international community are committed to ensuring the protection of the rights of all communities, but the people of Kosovo must accept their share of the responsibility. The Kosovo Albanians must respect the rights of the minority communities and, in turn, the minority communities must accept the risk of participation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">The Council mission has made it clear that there is no hidden agenda. What we are all trying to do, in conformity with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, is to take the process forward by establishing provisional self-government through the November elections and by creating a society in Kosovo that will be able to produce legitimate interlocutors for the discussions on a final settlement for Kosovo, as foreseen in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">I should like to conclude by extending, on behalf of the Secretary-General, my warmest appreciation to the Council for the significant contribution it has made through its recent visit to the furtherance of the democratic process in Kosovo. We hope that the discussion we have here today will enable us to move further along this path, as this will serve the cause of peace in Kosovo and in the region.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01"> Allow me to bring to the Council's attention the fact that the report of the Security Council mission to Kosovo was presented to the Council in a public meeting on 19 June, the first available afternoon following the return of the mission to New York. The official record of that meeting is available in document <a href="../html/S-PV-4331.html">S/PV.4331</a> and provides a verbatim record of the presentation that was made on the mission and its findings.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The findings of the mission are contained in paragraphs 29-39 of <a href="../pdf/S-2001-600.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/600</a>. These are very well articulated, carefully considered and intended to make progress in the resolution of outstanding issues in Kosovo and in enhancing the democratic process there. As Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno just mentioned, the Council mission conveyed a very firm and balanced message during its visit and we hope that it will make some difference in the situation there. Again, I would draw the Council's attention to the findings of the mission and urge it to consider them for further action in this area.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Granovsky</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">We wish to thank the Secretary-General for the detailed report he has submitted on the work of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). His assessments and conclusions, supplemented by the report of the Security Council mission on its visit to Kosovo and Belgrade, provide us with a good opportunity for a comprehensive review of the situation in and around the province and to identify further possible steps fully to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">We listened attentively and with great interest to the detailed and extremely useful briefing given by Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno. He has offered a valuable analysis of the situation in Kosovo; Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">We extend our thanks to you, Sir, as the Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations, for the excellent manner in which you organized the Security Council's mission to Kosovo and Belgrade. We are also grateful to the leadership of UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR), as well as the personnel of the Secretariat here in New York, for their assistance during the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The outcome of the mission's work confirm the timeliness and value of the visit by members of the Security Council to Kosovo and Belgrade, which had been proposed by Russia. It held substantive meetings of great importance with the UNMIK and KFOR leadership; the leadership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's Committee on Kosovo; the representatives of Albanian and Serbian communities in the province; and with delegations from other Kosovo minorities. I note in particular the importance of the substantive talks between the mission and President Kostunica of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and other Yugoslavian leaders in Belgrade.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">The main result of the visit was a clearly stated demand to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, the Kosovo Force and all Kosovo political leaders that they ensure the full and comprehensive implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, primarily with respect to the security of minorities.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">One very important event was, in our opinion, the meeting between the Security Council mission and the President of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir Putin, on 17 June at the headquarters of the Russian contingent in Kosovo. At that meeting, what was particularly stressed was the need to isolate extremists on both sides in Kosovo and to prevent them from driving a wedge into the position held by members of the international community on a settlement in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">Today, first and foremost, we must put an end to violence, terrorism and drug trafficking in and around Kosovo, ensure security and equal rights for all communities in the province without exception, and create appropriate conditions for the return to the province of refugees and internally displaced persons. Further serious efforts are essential to complete the disarmament of combatants and to eliminate their illegal armed units. We must step up the battle against crime, smuggling and illegal deliveries of weapons into the province, in violation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1160 (1998)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">The recent steps taken by the UNMIK leadership against the illegal possession of weapons, the illicit crossing of the administrative and other borders of Kosovo, and terrorism create additional opportunities here.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">One of the key issues now is the preparation of the Kosovo-wide elections. Our position on the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government in Kosovo is well known. Too many concessions have been made to the radicals. The document has a whole range of substantive shortcomings, to which Russia has frequently drawn attention. First of all, the Constitutional Framework contains no reference to the need for full compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, including its basic provision of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. We regard as hasty the rushed adoption of the Constitutional Framework by the head of UNMIK and the declaration that province-wide elections would be held this autumn. Truly democratic and representative Kosovo-wide elections require careful preparation and -- I would stress this point -- the active involvement of Belgrade. We believe that in order to hold the elections, security conditions must be established that would guarantee that the genuine will of all ethnic communities in the province is respected and that they can all participate fairly in the new bodies of self-government. In this regard, it is important that even before the elections, the steady process of the return of refugees and displaced persons should begin.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa10">We have often said -- and we would like once more to stress the point -- that haste in holding the elections would only strengthen the mono-ethnic nature and the radical and nationalistic mood of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa11">We would like again, to warn very seriously against any attempts to impose coercive measures under the pretext that the status quo is unacceptable and that the situation in Mitrovica needs to be resolved before the elections. Solving the problem of Mitrovica is inseparable from imposing order and security throughout the territory of Kosovo. Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno spoke of this. Only when the Serbs can feel safe everywhere can one start establishing a normal multi-ethnic life in Mitrovica. We agree with the opinion that was expressed at the meeting between the Security Council mission and the municipal administrator of Mitrovica, Mr. Rogers, that the status quo is preferable to extremist scenarios. Any acts of violence here would be fraught with the most dangerous consequences: a flare-up of violence throughout northern Kosovo, the involvement of Albanians in it, and then Serbs being forced out of that part of the province, which in fact would mean that they would be driven completely out of Kosovo. The solution can only be a political, comprehensive and carefully monitored one, and the basis for it must be a strengthening of trust between the Serb and Albanian communities.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa12">We note the work done by the Secretary-General's Special Representative in Kosovo, Mr. Haekkerup, and the Mission that he heads as they try to establish normality in the province. We welcome steps to develop a dialogue between UNMIK and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In particular, we welcome the recent visit by Mr. Haekkerup to Belgrade. We are counting on further development of such cooperation on all matters relating to implementation of Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, and not just in those cases where UNMIK comes up against problems that require it to count on assistance from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We would like to emphasize once more that unless there is solid involvement with Belgrade, the Mission will not be able to discharge its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa13">In this connection, I would like to note in particular the importance of fully taking into account in the work of UNMIK and KFOR the proposals made by President Kostunica in his meeting with the Security Council mission on specific steps by the international presence there to ensure that real progress is made in enhancing the level of security for Serbs and other minorities. We confirm the need for signing with Belgrade a status-of-forces agreement for UNMIK and KFOR. As was stressed by President Putin of the Russian Federation, in order to speed up stabilization in the Balkans it is necessary to coordinate the efforts of the international community in countering terrorism and extremism and to ensure strict implementation, without any exceptions, of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1994).pdf" class="nolink">resolution 1244 (1994)</a> and the Dayton Peace Accords on Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa14">The aggressiveness of the terrorist and extremist groups is extending to new areas, threatening further territorial spillover and undermining general security in the whole region. The main source of instability is still Kosovo. Any attempts to appease the terrorists will simply worsen the current explosive situation and expand it to include the entire Balkan region. This applies fully to what is happening today in Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa15">All of this confirms yet again that in order to stabilize the situation in the Balkans we need approaches based primarily on the political will of the States in the region and active assistance from the international community. That was the thrust of President Putin's proposal to convene a Balkan summit so that States of the region could conclude a legally binding agreement setting forth their mutual commitments to comply fully with the basic principles of inter-State relations, including, primarily, the inviolability of borders, sovereign equality, respect for territorial integrity, non-intervention in one another's internal affairs and non-use and non-threat of force.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa16">The signal from the international community must be clear and unambiguous. There can be no further redrawing of borders in Europe, including in the Balkans. It is necessary to establish a solid, effective barrier to extremism, national intolerance and religious fanaticism. People who try to solve extremely complex problems of a national and religious nature by force of weapons are not worthy of support from the international community.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">I will keep my remarks very brief, because I think the report of the Council mission basically says it all. As Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno noted in his comments, the mission sent clear messages to its interlocutors. In my view, and in the view of my authorities, it was very useful. I want to commend you also, Mr. President, on your leadership and your effort to get so much into such a short period of time. It really was quite useful. It was particularly useful, I think, that we had the occasion to meet with Presidents Putin and Kostunica during the visit, because it I think it helped all of us understand better the context that we are working in.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">I just wanted to emphasize a couple of key points from the United States point of view. We strongly support the efforts of Mr. Haekkerup and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), including on the importance of moving to elections and improving security in the region. It was very clear that they have ambitious plans in that regard, and we support that wholeheartedly.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">I also want to repeat, very simply, that the United States, as we go through this process, will support all those who favour dialogue in the political process and will oppose those who continue to incite violence, and we condemn violence from whatever quarter it comes.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa01"> I thank the representative of the United States for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Lee</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa01">First, Mr. President, we too would like to express our appreciation for your able leadership of the Council's mission to Kosovo. We also express our thanks to the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-565.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/565</a>), which we found very useful as background to the mission. We further thank the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Guéhenno, for his analysis of the key issues relating to the situation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa02">Singapore's participation in the mission to Kosovo gave us a better understanding of one of the more complex United Nations peacekeeping mission, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). We were impressed with what has been achieved in the two years that the United Nations has been involved with Kosovo, and we commend Mr. Hans Haekkerup for his outstanding leadership and his fine work since taking up the post of UNMIK head in January 2001. We also commend the staff of UNMIK for their efforts and their achievements in rebuilding Kosovo in all aspects: security, socio-political and economic, to name just a few.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa03">However, much more needs to be done. The involvement of the United Nations in Kosovo and the strict implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> must continue despite the great difficulties facing UNMIK. The political status of Kosovo is clear in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>; that issue should not be allowed to create further divisions in Kosovo, with all their adverse regional implications. In a statement made in January of this year by the Foreign Minister of Singapore, His Excellency Mr. S. Jayakumar, we outlined three critical areas which we felt needed to be addressed in Kosovo to bring it back to normalcy.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa04">Today I would like to reiterate what we believe to be the most critical of them at this time: the urgent need for reconciliation amongst the Kosovar ethnic communities. That, of course, is easier said than done. But we have learned from our own experience that promoting ethnic tolerance is the key to bringing together all ethnic communities. In 1964 two waves of racial riots broke out in Singapore. A third wave of riots occurred in 1969, about four years after we attained independence as a republic. Many Singaporeans were killed in those riots. Although they were not on the scale of what has happened in Kosovo, the riots shook our nation badly. Singapore is a multi-ethnic society where different races have lived and worked together for more than three decades. It was recognized at an early stage in our history that the very existence of Singapore would depend on maintaining racial and religious harmony among our people. Thus, the Government of Singapore has adopted and continues to promote a policy of multi-ethnicity and multiculturalism. Each Singaporean is taught from an early age to respect other races, religions and cultures.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa05">We therefore associate ourselves with those who have spoken out to condemn the continuing violence against members of ethnic minorities, in particular ethnic Serbs, in Kosovo. We also welcome the recent establishment of the first pillar and the initiatives taken by UNMIK to tackle terrorism and organized crime. We urge that all necessary measures be taken to improve the security environment in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa06">It is essential that the United Nations be clear on the goals for Kosovo, in order to ensure that they are achieved. Besides reconciliation, there are other important goals. We note that the initial economic reconstruction measures that have been taken and the progress that has been achieved in the economic arena have produced encouraging results to spur economic development in Kosovo. We support the continued emphasis on developing economic sustainability. Economic growth is a strong incentive for the Kosovars to work towards a peaceful, stable and secure environment, which, in turn, is essential for the further building of the economy.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa07">However, progress in reconciliation and economic development depends on the preparedness of the Kosovo political leadership, as they take on the responsibility of self-government, to build a democratic multi-ethnic society and a sustainable market economy in Kosovo. We also associate ourselves with those speakers who stress the importance of the full participation and engagement of all the ethnic communities in Kosovo in developing substantial autonomy.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa08">In that regard, we support the position that Kosovo-wide elections should be held only when all the necessary conditions are in place. It is crucial to the success of the elections that all communities, including refugees and displaced persons -- who should be encouraged to return -- participate both in registration and in the elections themselves. Rebuilding public administration capacity is also crucial to bringing Kosovo back to normalcy. In that regard, the uniqueness of UNMIK as a United Nations peacekeeping operation, like that of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, stands out. UNMIK is an interim administration in every sense of the word, and its task must therefore be to develop Kosovo's ability to administer society as part of the peace-building process.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa09">It is clear that, while UNMIK has made significant progress, Kosovo's return to normalcy is likely to take many more years. The priority tasks that have been outlined today require the United Nations and the international community to continue to be actively engaged in Kosovo. It is imperative that the United Nations, having taken on such a major undertaking, not terminate it prematurely.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa10">Allow me to say that we welcome the improving relations between UNMIK and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We should continue to encourage it. In that regard, the establishment of the UNMIK Office in Belgrade was a step along the right path. Direct dialogue between Kosovar political leaders and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should also be encouraged. We share the view that continued dialogue with the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is important for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Shen Guofang</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">At the outset, the Chinese delegation thanks the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Guéhenno, for his analysis of the situation in Kosovo. The Chinese delegation wishes also to express appreciation to Ambassador Chowdhury for his introduction of the report of the Security Council mission to Kosovo (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-600.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/600</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Under Ambassador Chowdhury's outstanding leadership, the mission completed its task in a most efficient manner, and was successful in sending to all sides an important message on rejecting violence and terrorism, and on the need to respect the rights of minority communities. The report of the mission is balanced and frank, and points the way for the future work of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR); it also sets out clear demands. In the next phase, whether or not those demands are met will provide a benchmark for evaluating the work of UNMIK and of KFOR. In that sense, the mission's visit played a positive role.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">As the report notes, since his appointment to lead UNMIK, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, along with UNMIK under his leadership and KFOR, have done a great deal towards carrying out their tasks, and have achieved some positive results in a number of areas. We appreciate their hard work.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Yet the security situation in Kosovo needs to be further improved. We note that the security of minority ethnic communities, particularly Kosovo Serbs, has yet to be guaranteed; they have returned in very small numbers, and their reintegration into society and their participation in the UNMIK-led political process has been minimal. The Chinese delegation has always stressed that, without broad participation by all ethnic communities, the outcome of elections cannot be fair but will, to the contrary, only further exacerbate inter-ethnic tension. In that connection, we note that the report indicates that the top priority now is to encourage all Kosovo communities, particularly the Serbs, to participate in the process. It also underscores the importance of dialogue and cooperation with the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That is crucial. We encourage UNMIK to continue and further enhance its cooperation with the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and to create a mechanism for regular dialogue, so as to ensure that the views of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are fully heard and that its reasonable proposals are accepted.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">They should together foster a multi-ethnic, multicultural, richly diverse society in Kosovo, a society characterized by equality and mutual assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">At the same time, we hope that the minority communities in Kosovo will actively participate in the general elections. Needless to say, the precondition is that the security situation must be fundamentally improved and the plight of the minority communities, as well as the question of their property, must be satisfactorily addressed. In this regard UNMIK and KFOR should take further steps, including combating extremism, encouraging moderates on all sides, establishing inter-communal confidence, facilitating economic development and promoting stability, so that the findings of the mission may be translated into concrete action and so that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> may thus be fully and effectively implemented.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the accomplishment of national reconciliation in Kosovo will be a long, ongoing process and will require sustained and indefatigable efforts on the part of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">However, the international community cannot remain passive in the face of attempts to undermine national reconciliation. Any efforts to nudge Kosovo towards independence, or attempts to condone extremist forces that advocate the dissolution of other ethnic communities, are extremely dangerous and will lead to new upheavals in the Balkans, whose ultimate victims will be the peoples of that region.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">The Security Council is duty-bound and, with the rest of the international community, must endeavour to stem this tendency so as to avoid history repeating itself.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">Here I should like to emphasize that our efforts to resolve the Kosovo question must be taken in the context of the situation in the entire region. The political situation in Macedonia is very unsettling. The situations in Kosovo and in Macedonia are closely interrelated, and they will impact on each other. We hope that the Security Council will closely follow developments in the entire region.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Let me start with words of gratitude to the Bangladesh presidency and to Ambassador Chowdhury personally for the fruitful efforts in leading the Security Council mission to Kosovo and Belgrade. I am also grateful to Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno for his comprehensive and very informative briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">Both reports -- that of the Secretary-General and that of the Council mission -- give us a clear picture of the situation on the ground. Thus I will briefly highlight our major comments.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Ukraine welcomes the progress made by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> in the two years since its establishment. We believe that the recent UNMIK efforts in pursuit of the goals of holding Kosovo-wide elections, implementing a constitutional framework and setting the stage for self-government and economic viability will lead to a more stable and secure Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">But the alley of trees planted by UNMIK will be a blind alley unless a security environment for the elections and the participation of all Kosovo communities, refugees and displaced persons, is ensured. The engagement and political presence of the Serb community is of utmost importance, and my delegation fully supports the recent statements of Yugoslav authorities encouraging Kosovo Serbs to register for elections.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">As for interim institutions, we pay special tribute to the activities of the Interim Administrative Council and the Kosovo Transitional Council. The involvement of all communities in these structures is yet another vital element to further the democratic processes in the region, and we call upon UNMIK to redouble its efforts to promote this goal.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">Without a doubt, the establishment of a new police and justice pillar of UNMIK, aimed at strengthening the fight against ethnic violence and crime, is commendable. The general criminality in Kosovo is one of the most dangerous security challenges, and we are encouraged by the robust measures UNMIK is taking to combat it and to bolster a legislative basis for prosecuting terrorism and organized crime.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">My delegation is satisfied with the important work done by UNMIK in the area of media regulation and development. The establishment of an independent Radio Television Kosovo, and promising results in the field of media development in the minority communities do strengthen our positive impressions. At the same time, let me express our deep concerns about the reported expressions of support for extremism and terrorism by some Kosovo local press. We are confident that any public manifestations of inter-ethnic hatred and support for violence should not be tolerated.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">May I quote the words of an important personality who said that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg009-bk02-pa09">"Men stumble over the truth from time to time, but most pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing happened."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Upon the return of the Security Council mission from Kosovo, I quote these famous words by Sir Winston Churchill in order to pay particular attention to, in our view, a highly important question -- whether or not the Council belongs to those who hurry off.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">In fact, the truth is very difficult. After the two years that have passed since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, the security, inter-ethnic and humanitarian situation in Kosovo remains tense. We share the view that the level of violence and crime in the region, especially against ethnic communities, is unacceptably high. Moreover, a general increase in tensions in Mitrovica, Gnjilane and Pristina, as well as brutal attacks on individuals, vividly prove that the philosophy and practice of violence are still very much alive.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa12">It is our strong conviction that the only way to change the psychology of war lies in the more intensified and concerted efforts of the Security Council, European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Yugoslav authorities and those Kosovo political leaders who really believe in a democratic, multi-ethnic Kosovo. We hope that the principal findings of the mission will encourage the Council to hurry in, in order to improve the situation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa13">We agree that there is need for a further coordinated approach, particularly provided by UNMIK, to overcome the dangerous challenges, including inadequate physical, social and economic security for the ethnic communities in Kosovo, alongside a lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa14">My delegation is in favour of the mission's recommendation that a formal request should be sent to the Kosovo Force (KFOR) to regularly provide detailed information on the origin, type and quantity of weapons seized in the region. The work of the Security Council committee established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1160 (1998)</a>, should also be intensified. Let me also share our strong belief that UNMIK must continue and enhance its dialogue with the authorities of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, ensuring the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa15">Concluding my remarks in a broader context, I would like to welcome the unilateral demobilization by ethnic Albanian armed groups in south-east Serbia and the peaceful completion of the return of Yugoslavia security forces to the ground safety zone. Ukraine highly appreciates this achievement, which was made possible by the European Union, the North Atlantic Alliance and the Yugoslav leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa16">We would also like to align ourselves with a position of the European Union declared at a recent summit in Goteborg, on recent developments in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to reaffirm our commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ryan</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Following our mission to Kosovo under your efficient leadership, Mr. President, and the most recent report of the Secretary-General, this meeting enables us to assess developments in Kosovo and to focus on the way forward. I am grateful to Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his comprehensive introductory comments.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">As Ireland fully associates itself with the statement that will be delivered later by the Permanent Representative of Sweden on behalf of the European Union, I will highlight only a few issues of particularly pressing concern.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">Despite the progress made, we see clearly the difficulties that remain in Kosovo, and we see clearly also the deep-rooted divisions between the different communities. As President Putin said to us last Sunday, the task assigned to Special Representative Haekkerup is "Herculean". However, we have no doubt that the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) will achieve their mandates to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, and we support fully their work in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">It is clear that the only possible future for all the people of Kosovo is a multi-ethnic society based firmly on respect for minority and human rights. As part of the Security Council mission to Kosovo, I urged the communities' representatives to develop the special courage to participate in the process towards achieving this. In so doing, I drew parallels between the Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement and the Constitutional Framework in Kosovo -- both of which provide for multi-ethnic structures, without prejudicing the character of an eventual, final constitutional status. Of course, both processes require courage, perseverance and generosity of spirit on all sides.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">Ireland understands very well the profound concerns expressed by the Serbs about the security situation in Kosovo. Most of those who remain in the province live in ghettos. Their freedom of movement is severely restricted, and they exist in a climate of constant fear. We welcome the recent decision by the Special Representative to establish a new police and justice pillar, and the promulgation of three UNMIK regulations. It is essential to make further early, quantifiable progress in the security area, including regarding the illegal importation of and trafficking in weapons and the recovery of existing illegally held weapons. During the course of the mission, we told the ethnic Albanian representatives in the clearest terms that all terrorist activity must cease. We must sustain and reinforce that message so that they can be in no doubt whatever as to the refusal of the international community to countenance any form of extremism.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">While we welcome the opening of the UNMIK office in Belgrade, and the various meetings between the Special Representative and President Kostunica, we believe that the Mission must liaise even more closely with the administration there, including on conditions which could lead to the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">President Kostunica has already accepted the Constitutional Framework and has encouraged Serbs to register for the elections. It is now essential that he encourage them to vote. Like many Council members, I was impressed by the honesty and realism displayed by the President, Foreign Minister Svilanovic and Interior Minister Zivkovic, and I have no doubt that they will use their influence wisely and positively. In the interim, all parties must work to develop the essential components of a positive climate for Serb participation in the elections. Those components were discussed frankly with us by President Kostunica.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">I agree strongly with Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno's earlier statement that Mitrovica plays a central role in the political dynamics of Kosovo as a whole. A comprehensive strategy which includes political, social and religious elements is essential to address the situation there. The parallel structures in northern Mitrovica must be removed. The economic situation and the high level of unemployment -- which serve to fuel extremism -- also need to be improved systematically and steadily, as they need to be elsewhere in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">The lack of progress in relation to missing persons is clearly a source of great contention for both communities, for whom it is a cause of common suffering and disquiet. During the mission we delivered messages to the relevant parties about this and about the need to release remaining political detainees.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">We believe the mission had a useful, practical effect in that it underlined the full support of the Security Council for UNMIK and KFOR; it sent strong and unambiguous messages to all sides; and it imparted an important signal from the Council as to the importance of the high priority of sustained contact and cooperation with Belgrade.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Doutriaux</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">The Permanent Representative of Sweden will state the European Union's position later, and France of course endorses that position. I will simply make a few comments in my national capacity on points that we would like to stress.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">As members of the Council all noted during the mission that you, Sir, led last week to Kosovo and Belgrade, it is absolutely essential that the political process currently under way in Kosovo continue. A continuation of the status quo is neither acceptable nor sustainable. In this regard, Mr. Haekkerup's promulgation of the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government, and the announcement that general elections would be held on 17 November, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, have opened up a political prospect that is essential to stability in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">It is essential to prepare carefully for the elections so that they assist the democratic process in Kosovo, and so that all the communities, in particular the Kosovo Serbs, are able to participate. Everything must be done to ensure that every community -- and, to begin with, the Serb community -- is included. This is crucial to the future of Kosovo. It is up to the Kosovo Serbs to shoulder their responsibilities. It is in their interest and in the interest of other communities to participate in the elections and in the institutions of provisional self-government that will be set up. The provisions in the Constitutional Framework for the representation of minorities and the defence of their interests will enable them to exercise their rights and to play their rightful role in the future of Kosovo. We urge them to register and to vote.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">In addition, I would like to voice our full support for the vigorous measures taken by Mr. Haekkerup to ensure law and order in Kosovo. The Special Representative's promulgation of a regulation on unauthorized border/boundary crossings and an anti-terrorism regulation -- as urged by the Contact Group in particular -- are steps in the right direction. The strengthening of border and boundary controls by the Kosovo Force (KFOR) is part of this effort. The Special Representative's establishment of the new police and justice pillar will make more effective the fight against organized-crime networks and the pursuit of extremists and will help suppress violence in Kosovo. This is why we strongly support the request for a new Assistant Secretary-General post to head this new pillar. More generally, the new structure must be urgently given both the financial and human resources it needs to discharge its mission.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Improving security for everyone, particularly minorities, is crucial, given the upcoming elections. Extremists should not expect any indulgence from us. Isolating them is in the interests of everybody. Everyone, including the members of the Albanian community, must strongly condemn violence and isolate extremists who remain in or around Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">In Mitrovica, in order to encourage coexistence of the communities, we must define and implement a comprehensive and lasting strategy including economic, political and security measures. I am glad that following the Security Council's visit to Kosovo, UNMIK stated that it intended to prepare such a strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">One recommendation in the report of the Council's mission relates to stepping up the dialogue between UNMIK and Belgrade. We wholeheartedly support this. We welcome President Kostunica's call to the Kosova Serb community to register for the general elections of 17 November, and we welcome the increase of contacts between Mr. Haekkerup and the Yugoslav authorities, as well as the official opening of the UNMIK office in Belgrade. The Special Representative has offered the Belgrade authorities proposals to encourage the organized return of displaced Serbs to Kosovo. This is a step in the right direction. We believe strongly that closer cooperation between the United Nations and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on matters of common concern will be helpful.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mejdoub</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">Allow me, Sir, first of all, to congratulate you once again for the manner in which you led the Council mission to Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to follow up on and assess development in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">From the outset, I would like to say that this mission, like all those the Council has taken to the field, was a complete success because it was able to observe first hand the level of commitment of the various parties with regard to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and also of obstacles perceived by the parties in the implementation of the relevant provisions of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">The meetings of the mission with President Putin and President Kostunica were of particular importance because they enabled members of the Council to hold a fruitful exchange of views on the requirements of the particularly sensitive phase through which the entire subregion is currently passing. The meetings the mission held with the various Kosovar communities enabled those groups to express their concerns. They also enabled the Council members to convey to them a clear message to the effect that multi-ethnicity is a sine qua non for lasting peace, not only in Kosovo but in the entire subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">At this stage of my statement I would like to thank Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the Under-Secretary-General, for the excellent analysis that he has just presented to the Council on the report of the Secretary-General on Kosovo. The Tunisian delegation feels that there is no alternative in that country to tolerance and cohabitation. It goes without saying that establishing lasting confidence-building measures among the various communities is the foundation of a future multi-ethnic Kosovo. There are of course a number of both structural and circumstantial reasons that underlie the breach of trust and continue to fuel mistrust and mutual rejection. This, in my delegation's opinion, is a predicament to which an urgent remedy must be found, because any settlement of this question basically depends on the support by the parties of a shared vision of a common future.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">In this context we are gratified that the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has focused its activities in the field and among all the parties concerned on the basic prerequisite of coexistence among the various communities and has kept them closely channelled within the framework of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. With the help and support of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the civilian police unit, UNMIK has achieved significant success in the implementation of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">The operation's present critical phase requires stronger political and financial support for UNMIK so that it can be sure of providing the follow-up to and implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, which in the opinion of my delegation remains the perfect instrument for the resolution of the Kosovo question.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">Tunisia feels the time has come for the Kosovar parties themselves to undertake a direct and responsible dialogue on the many issues of contention that they raised in their meetings with the Security Council mission to the region. In this context it must be made quite clear that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> is not negotiable, for it constitutes the international guarantee for a durable peace in Kosovo and among all Kosovars.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">The recommendations in the mission's report are also unanimous messages that the Council is sending to all the parties concerned. The political process in Kosovo must indeed proceed in conformity with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, and all the parties, in particular the Kosovo Serbs, must take an active part. Remaining on the sidelines will certainly not make it any easier for that community to assert its concerns about security and other issues.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">The promulgation of the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government and the decision to hold elections throughout Kosovo on 17 November are two important stages that must be supported by all the parties concerned. We are gratified that President Kostunica has launched a pressing appeal to the Kosovo Serb community in Kosovo, calling on them to commit to the electoral process. We are convinced that it is only by supporting this process that the Serb community in Kosovo can assert its views and concerns and find its place in society.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">The establishment of Pillar I by the Special Representative is an additional guarantee promoting justice and an end to impunity. Financial means are necessary for justice and the police system to continue to contribute to allaying fears and establishing security for all.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">It is essential that the question of the return of the refugees and displaced persons be handled rapidly, preferably before the forthcoming elections. The same applies to persons who have disappeared or are in detention. Finding solutions to the humanitarian aspects of the question will promote reconciliation among the various communities in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">The situation in Mitrovica demonstrates the breadth and depth of the gulf between the Albanian-speaking and Kosovo-Serb communities. Just as that city embodies that rift, and the paranoia and even distrust of what the international community is undertaking for Kosovo, so must the international partners in Kosovo maintain their efforts rapidly to re-establish trust between the main communities of the city and encourage interaction between them in the various spheres of social life.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa13">The international programmes for the economic recovery of that iconic city can be seen as a tool for consolidating the interdependence of the two communities. The experiment begun in that context by the European Union has proven effective and should be stepped up. It has the merit of helping ethnic divisions to be healed through co-existence, which in turn will become a condition for the stability and prosperity of all ethnic groups. This will ultimately prove to Kosovars of all ethnicities that it is up to them and them alone to create the conditions to guarantee lasting reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa14">In conclusion, I wish to pay a ringing tribute to Mr. Hans Haekkerup for his commitment to the mission with which he has been entrusted. His outstanding leadership of UNMIK and his sense of restraint have made him a respected interlocutor of all Kosovo communities. My delegation also wishes to congratulate the Commander of KFOR and all the men and women who serve under him, as well as the civilian police elements of UNMIK, for their selflessness and devotion to the cause of peace.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Eldon</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">We thank Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for what I thought was an outstandingly thoughtful briefing this morning and one that we found very useful indeed.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">As others have said, the representative of Sweden will speak later on this morning on behalf of the European Union, so I will keep my statement very brief and make only a few points that I would like to highlight.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">The first is that the United Kingdom strongly endorses the findings of the Security Council following its mission to Kosovo. I think the mission's report is a very useful contribution and I hope it will be helpful to the wider membership as well.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">Secondly, I should like to endorse the point that Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno made about the need for a clear message from the authorities in Belgrade to the Serb community about the importance of participation. It is in the interest of all communities in Kosovo to participate in the elections and in the structures being put together by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in order to secure their place in the shaping of Kosovo's future. I therefore think it vital that this message of encouragement should get across from Belgrade, particularly now that some progress is being made on the return of refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">A similar consideration applies to Mitrovica, where normalization would clearly be in the interest of all the people of the city. This, too, is an area where we would look to Belgrade to use its influence positively to help resolve the situation. I noted what Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno had to say about the importance of confidence-building measures and I take his point.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">Finally, extremism and organized crime are at the heart of the problems in Kosovo and in the wider region. We fully support the work being carried out by UNMIK and the Kosovo Force to tackle these issues. It would be helpful to have a progress report from the Secretariat on funding for the new Pillar I, including funding for additional judges and prosecutors. It is crucial that sufficient resources be made available quickly and, as we have said before, the United Kingdom stands ready to provide candidates for the posts of international judges and prosecutors.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Neewoor</span> <span class="nation">Mauritius</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa01">We consider today's public meeting on Kosovo to be most appropriate, following last weekend's visit of the Security Council mission to the area. We thank you, Sir, for organizing this important meeting. We also thank Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his briefing this morning. As a member of the mission to Kosovo, I wish to place on record my warm and sincere appreciation and thanks to you, Sir, for the quality of leadership you provided to the mission, which was the first ever to include all 15 Security Council members.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa02">The report of the mission in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-565.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/565</a> broadly sums up the important work accomplished by the Security Council mission during the brief three-day visit to Kosovo and Belgrade. The visit not only provided us with the opportunity to see first hand the actual situation on the ground in Kosovo, but also gave us clearer insight into the deep-rooted issues that have bedevilled the territory and its people. We have come back better informed as a result of the discussions we had with the various parties, including the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup; officials of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK); the Commander of the Kosovo Force (KFOR); members of the Interim Administration; representatives of the Albanian and Serb communities; civil society; and, in Belgrade, with President Kostunica and members of his Cabinet. We hope to be able to contribute more substantially to the efforts of the Security Council and the Secretary-General to restore peace and stability in the area.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa03">The Kosovo crisis has been a real human tragedy of our time. The lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people have been completely shattered. Although the conflict is largely over, the people of Kosovo continue to live in a situation of bitter ethnic divide, mutual hatred and fear. The minorities, both Serbs and Albanians in many communities, remain confined to their homes due to fear. Employment opportunities are extremely scarce, depriving people of the means to earn their livelihood, and hundreds of thousands of people are living outside their normal homes, either as internally displaced persons or as refugees. Worst of all, children, having lived through the trauma of death and devastation in the civil conflict, are unable to attend school unless accompanied by KFOR soldiers.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa04">In such difficult circumstances, UNMIK and KFOR are valiantly engaged in maintaining peace and security and they deserve to be not only commended, but also fully supported by all of us in all that they are doing in Kosovo to restore confidence among the people, to engage them in a political process, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, and to rebuild a society based on multi-ethnicity and the rule of law and justice for all. This task is as daunting as the situation is complex. The immediate and most important challenge before UNMIK is to organize elections with popular participation for the administration of Kosovo as an autonomous region within the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The election has to be inclusive in order to have the credibility required in today's difficult situation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa05">In this regard, we have two important concerns. First, the security situation must improve in order to facilitate the full participation of all eligible Kosovars -- Albanians, Serbs and other minorities -- in the process. Secondly, every effort must be made to ensure that voters, in particular Serb voters, both inside and outside Kosovo, have the opportunity to register to vote without any hindrance. The other important challenge before UNMIK is to initiate the process of economic reconstruction in Kosovo. While some work is already being done to rebuild infrastructures, it is necessary to start a number of small projects which can provide employment to job-seekers from both the majority and the minority communities. We appeal to the international community to extend all possible assistance for the economic reconstruction of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa06">Our visit to Belgrade and the discussions we had there with President Kostunica, the Minister of Interior and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have convinced us that Yugoslavia is not only prepared to fully cooperate with the Security Council and UNMIK, but that it is already doing so, for example, by officially encouraging the Serbs to register to vote, in spite of its serious reservations on certain provisions of the recently adopted legal framework for Kosovo. We appreciate this positive attitude of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa07">We call upon all the people of Kosovo - Albanians and Serbs alike -- to shed extremism, which has already brought so much misfortune and suffering to them. The future of Kosovo lies in the multi-ethnic coexistence of all communities, and that should be the goal they must work for together. Indeed, almost all nations of the world, including mine, Mauritius, have multi-ethnic societies that have learned to live in harmony. There is no reason why Kosovars should not be able to do the same.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01"> I thank the representative of Mauritius for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Touré</span> <span class="nation">Mali</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to congratulate Ambassador Chowdhury of Bangladesh, President of the Security Council, on his the excellent leadership during our visit to Kosovo and Belgrade. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report of 7 June 2001 on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), and Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, Under-Secretary-General, for his very detailed introduction of the report.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">This morning's open meeting offers an opportunity to reiterate Mali's full support for Mr. Hans Haekkerup, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of UNMIK, for all of his team and for all of the international personnel who have been working tirelessly for two years now to attain the goals of peace, security and sustainable development in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">Despite the many political, economic and security problems facing UNMIK, we must recognize that considerable progress has been made in the implementation of its mandate. While we welcome this tangible progress, my delegation strongly supports the sustained efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) Commander in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and thus to establish democratic and multi-ethnic institutions in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">In view of the information given us by Mr. Guéhenno and what I was able to see and hear during our very important visit to Kosovo, I shall focus on the following few highlights. First of all, at the political level, my delegation is grateful to Mr. Haekkerup and all UNMIK personnel for the promulgation of the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government in Kosovo and the declaration that elections would be held on 17 November this year.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">It is true, however, that during our visit we were able to see that the Constitutional Framework was not the subject of consensus among the political actors in Kosovo. Nevertheless, we think that the Constitutional Framework, which in no way prejudges a final settlement for Kosovo, provides the people of Kosovo with an opportunity to manage their daily life and encourages moderates to advance the political process, while keeping the extremists on the margins. Because it is the outcome of cooperation among UNMIK, the Joint Working Group, the political leaders of Kosovo, international experts and the international community, my delegation calls on all inhabitants of Kosovo to participate actively in the structures already established and in the future government of the territory.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">Regarding the Kosovo-wide elections to be held on 17 November, my delegation believes that the electoral process can strengthen the democratic process in Kosovo and stability in the region. Thus, we urge all the peoples of Kosovo to participate massively in the elections, which are essential to combat intransigent extremism and to encourage all kinds of moderates to take a decisive role in the affairs of the territory. Because the wholehearted participation of all communities is crucial to the election process, my delegation supports UNMIK's initiatives to establish a multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. We believe that the full and responsible participation of all sectors of Kosovar society in drawing up a reliable electoral roll can help ensure the free participation of all ethnic groups in the elections. We must do everything possible to ensure that the vote is held in conditions of security and that the return and participation of refugees and displaced persons is guaranteed. All communities, particularly Kosovar Serbs, must participate in the elections and the institutions of provisional self-government to be established. This is a major challenge that the international community, UNMIK and KFOR must take up.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">Secondly, in the area of security, my delegation is deeply concerned over continuing ethnic and political violence and organized crime in Kosovo. Without any doubt, violence against minorities in the province is the greatest obstacle to achieving the international community's goals of peace, democracy and prosperity in Kosovo. During our visit to Kosovo, this kind of blind violence as cited time and again as the main obstacle to the return of refugees and displaced persons and their participation in the democratic structures in Kosovo. My delegation welcomes the Special Representative's establishment of Pillar I, and legislation against organized crime, illegal weapons possession and terrorism. We hope that these measures will lead to considerable improvements in security conditions in Kosovo. We also support specific measures taken by UNMIK and KFOR on monitoring boundaries in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">Thirdly, at the economic level, we are still concerned over the very high unemployment rate in Kosovo and the disastrous state of the economy. Yet we welcome the establishment of tax collection points along Kosovo's borders, where duties are levied on some goods. Economic development is a major element of stability, and my delegation recommends that the international community make available additional funds for the Village Economic Rehabilitation Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa09">Fourthly, a source of concern for my delegation in the humanitarian sphere is the situation of the thousands of Albanian-speaking refugees from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia who have been in Kosovo since 3 May because of clashes between Macedonian forces and Albanian extremists. The international community must come to their assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa10">The question of individuals who have disappeared and of detainees remains crucial for my delegation. This continues to be a major obstacle to reconciliation among the communities. We encourage UNMIK to make further progress in this key area, and we urge the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities to release those who are still languishing in Serbian prisons.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa11">Fifthly, my delegation welcomes the close contacts between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and UNMIK and KFOR. The opening of the UNMIK Office in Belgrade will foster communication and cooperation between UNMIK and the Yugoslav authorities. We thank the Yugoslav authorities for their willingness and determination to cooperate with UNMIK to improve inter-communal relations, in Mitrovica in particular, and throughout Kosovo. The cooperation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities is crucial if minorities, especially Serbs, are to participate in the 17 November elections.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa12">Finally, my delegation understands the immensity of the task facing UNMIK, and we pay tribute to Mr. Hans Haekkerup for his steady hand as leader of UNMIK; we thank all the local and international personnel of UNMIK and of KFOR for their determination and for their commitment to implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We call on the international community to step up its efforts to help UNMIK at this crucial stage of its involvement in Kosovo to enable it to attain its objectives: peace, security and sustainable development.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdivieso</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">My thanks go to the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, for his presentation. The varied support of Mr. Guéhenno's department, including the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-565.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/565</a>), made a most significant contribution to the success of the Security Council's mission to the region.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">We share the voiced in the report of the Secretary-General that effective law and order is a high priority in UNMIK's work. We are pleased to see that the police and justice pillar of the Mission has been erected. With the cooperation of the Kosovo Force (KFOR), this will enhance UNMIK's effectiveness. We endorse the planned appointment of a deputy special representative of the Secretary-General to head that structure.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">Open meetings on Security Council missions are very useful for us, enabling us to join with all other States Members of the United Nations in assessing the fulfilment of mandates and in hearing first-hand views of the consequences of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">I thank Ambassador Chowdhury and congratulate him on the excellent way in which he led the mission. Thanks to his dedication, the mission attained its goals in record time. The 15 members of the Security Council reviewed compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and, with the various actors, assessed at close hand UNMIK's achievements and the challenges facing it, including through meetings with President Putin and with President Kostunica. The breadth of our meetings enhanced our understanding of the conflict and gave us a better perspective for taking the decisions that the Council will have to adopt in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">Let me make a few specific comments about the mission. I want to highlight the work of UNMIK and to acknowledge KFOR's valuable contribution. The responsibility and commitment shown by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, and his team as they work to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> are admirable and deserve our full support. UNMIK's achievements over the past two years are obvious, and constitute a realistic option for attaining the coexistence that is necessary in a multi-ethnic society.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">Considerable challenges face UNMIK and the international community. It is necessary, first of all, to guarantee the participation of all communities in the 17 November elections. We understand the concerns voiced by Kosovo Serbs, both those remaining in Kosovo and those who have taken refuge abroad, and we consider that a priority for UNMIK and KFOR in the coming months is to put in place security guarantees that will provide that community with freedom of movement within Kosovo and that will permit the return of refugees and displaced persons. In any event, they must be afforded full participation in the electoral process.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">We believe that the problem of detainees and of individuals who have disappeared demands priority attention. Its resolution is among the key elements in building trust among the parties.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">Another of the greatest challenges for the future is the problem of the city of Mitrovica. Here we need full cooperation from the Belgrade Government. Necessary prudence must not stop us from resolving the present social fragmentation and hostility. That city is a mirror of all the problems of Kosovo. What happens there will send a clear signal about the possible future of the rest of Kosovo. UNMIK must continuously work with KFOR to ensure that decisions are coordinated and that they do not yield conflicting effects. We call on the Belgrade Government to take a more active and constructive position in finding solutions for Mitrovica.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">It is urgent that the population of Kosovo speedily and fully understand the key role they must play in their own present and future. In other words, "kosovarization" must take place, to use a neologism spawned by this conflict. As the findings of the mission make clear, "the status quo is unacceptable" (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2001-600.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/600</a>, para. 30</i>). The responsibility of the international community is limited, but it will be even more limited without the support and cooperation of the population. We therefore appeal to all Kosovars to participate in the activities of the international community, to reject all violence, and to participate in the democratic process, especially the forthcoming elections, which will help create the conditions necessary for reconciliation, stability and progress in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">The attainment of those objectives will be enhanced by improved relations and dialogue between UNMIK and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which the Security Council must continue to promote.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">Let me thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open meeting to discuss the report of the Security Council mission to Kosovo and Belgrade, which took place from 16 to 18 June 2001. I wish also to thank the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Guéhenno, for his introduction of the report of the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-565.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/565</a>, and to say how much we appreciated that report, because it provided a very useful input during my delegation's preparations for the Security Council mission.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">I wish also to express my personal appreciation to you, Mr. President, for the impressive and effective leadership you provided for our short but intense mission as we sought to fulfil the terms of reference provided by the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">Coming just more than a year after the first Security Council mission to Kosovo, the recent mission provided us with an opportunity to assess the critical role played by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) over the past two years in promoting peace, reconciliation and stability, and in creating viable democratic institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">As the report indicates, the mission, in its meeting with local leaders, conveyed a strong message on the need to eschew violence and extremism and to focus on inter-ethnic reconciliation and inclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">Our visit to Belgrade also provided an opportunity to engage with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to listen to their concerns and to obtain their support for progress towards a multi-ethnic Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">As my delegation entirely supports the findings of the mission, I will only make brief comments on some issues which are of particular concern. These include the volatile security situation, efforts to enhance law enforcement, the return of refugees and the issue of missing persons and of detainees.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">As we were able to witness first hand, there has been considerable progress in the area of peace and security. While the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has tried to develop a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving the quality of life for all communities, the security situation for Kosovo's minority communities, particularly the Kosovo Serbs, remains of great concern. This is particularly true of Mitrovica. Unless the security situation of Kosovo's minority communities improves, peace and reconciliation are doomed to fail, and this will, in turn, reduce the possibility of the return to their homes of substantial numbers of refugees and displaced persons and our ability to provide sustained economic growth and sustainable development for the people of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">We were, therefore, pleased that the initiative recently undertaken by UNMIK to establish Pillar I to improve the coordination of police and justice matters is having success. In this regard, we welcome the promulgation of regulations pertaining to illegal border crossings and to the possession of illegal weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">We wish to emphasize the appeal made by UNMIK for an increase in the number of international judges and prosecutors and for additional funds to increase detention capacity. My delegation views these as crucial to improving the law and order situation, especially in the light of comments that perpetrators may have had to be released from detention due to the lack of proper detention facilities.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">I wish to take this opportunity as the Chairperson of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1160 (1998)</a> to draw attention to paragraphs 25 and 33 of the report (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-600.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/600</a>) and their importance to the process of maintaining law and order in Kosovo. These paragraphs highlight the discussions held between members of the mission and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) on the strengthening and monitoring of the arms embargo imposed pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1160 (1998)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">We were pleased to have had very fruitful discussions and we wish to thank the Commander of KFOR, Lieutenant General Thorstein Skiaker for his cooperation. We particularly appreciate the promise of detailed information on the origin, type and quantity of weapons seized.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">We were also informed by the UNMIK Police Commander about the quantity of weapons being seized and the attempts being made, some successfully, to disarm the population where appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">My delegation was pleased with the political progress being made on the preparations for elections to be held in November. We wish to reiterate the importance we attach to close collaboration between UNMIK and the authorities in Belgrade, particularly in regard to the registration and the participation of minority communities in the electoral process itself. For us, it is important that all communities participate in the governance of Kosovo, as only in this way will we be able to provide full participation in the democratic institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa14">One issue on which all communities again, pleaded for assistance, as they did last year, is missing persons. We believe that further progress can now be made on this issue with the use of DNA in the forensic work being carried out by UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa15">We also wish to encourage UNMIK to continue to promote conditions conducive to the return of refugees and displaced persons and to commend them for the progress already made in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa16">The report indicates that one of the greatest challenges is the promotion of multi-ethnicity. We believe that there is no simple or speedy solution to this problem. With the elections approaching, these issues become even more important, and we unreservedly support the emphasis in the report on the need for multi-ethnic initiatives in the social, economic and religious areas to start building confidence between the communities.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa17">At your initiative, Mr. President, a representative group of Kosovo women's non-governmental organizations met with members of mission, and during this meeting a number of issues of concern were raised. The representatives underlined the need to involve women in peace negotiations and in the political decision-making process in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. The importance of the international community's support for the economic empowerment of women, tackling discrimination and providing employment and equal opportunities, were identified as equally important. Emphasis was placed on the need for regular dialogue and enhanced cooperation between local women's groups and UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa18">We are grateful for the opportunity which, at your request, Mr. President, was provided to meet with the representatives of the non-governmental organizations because of the importance that we attach to civil society and the role that they play in the reconciliation efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa19">On the surface there has been improvement in Kosovo's economic situation. We saw reconstruction; we saw improved agricultural activity; we saw economic activity taking place throughout Pristina. Nevertheless, the economic situation continues to be of great concern, with high levels of unemployment, particularly among the youth, and the need to resolve issues relating to property rights, which could provide an enabling environment conducive to attracting foreign investment.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa20">It is important that these and other issues be addressed, as these problems can influence the return of refugees and displaced persons who are reluctant to return where there is no viable source of income.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa21">In conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity to express my delegation's appreciation to Mr. Hans Haekkerup, the Secretary-General's Special Representative, and to his staff, to the KFOR Commander and his staff, and to the men and women of UNMIK for the tremendous assistance provided to the mission during its stay in Kosovo.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01"> I thank the representative of Jamaica for the kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kolby</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">I, too, would like to thank Under-Secretary--General Guéhenno for his briefing and for the Secretary-General's report. I would also like to thank you, Mr. President, for leading our mission efficiently and for presenting our report. We found our meetings useful and important, not least our interactions with President Kostunica and President Putin.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">For two years now, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has made good progress in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. Norway commends UNMIK, led by Hans Haekkerup, and the Kosovo Force (KFOR), led by Thorstein Skiaker, for their efforts, together with our partners in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the European Union pillars, to create conditions for a multi-ethnic democratic Kosovo. Our overall aim must be to promote peace and stability and to stop disintegration and extremism in the Balkan region. And much remains to be done.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">As a major provider of personnel and assistance to Kosovo, Norway has a strong interest in the successful implementation of self-government in Kosovo, based on the Constitutional Framework and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The single most important challenge is the security situation. As made clear in the Secretary-General's report and during our mission, minority communities, in particular Kosovo Serbs, continue to suffer from ethnic violence and major crimes. Neither do extremists shun violence against fellow ethnic Albanians to advance political or criminal interests.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">We therefore firmly support the Special Representative of the Secretary-General's initiatives to improve law and order, including through a new police and justice pillar and three new regulations directed against extremists. Reports from Kosovo indicate that the weapons amnesty programme has been a success.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">Ongoing programmes providing for assessment and destruction of small-arms stockpiles should be expanded to other parts of the region. Norway welcomes the endeavours of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe in this regard. A main concern is the trafficking in such weapons. Cross-border police cooperation must be enhanced. The Macedonian crisis shows the need for a comprehensive approach. Plans for regional police training with a focus on all kinds of trafficking are being developed in the context of the Stability Pact's police cooperation and training initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">We welcome the willingness of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Government to cooperate with the UNMIK police in addressing illegal trafficking, as expressed to the Council mission. We look forward to hearing from UNMIK about the follow-up and results.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">It is clear to us that closer cooperation with Belgrade is needed on a range of issues facing UNMIK in the time leading up to elections. We count on -- and expect -- Serb leaders in Belgrade and Kosovo to support UNMIK's endeavours to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. Norway welcomes the positive attitude of President Kostunica regarding Kosovo Serb registration. Closer cooperation between UNMIK and Belgrade is also crucial to resolve the fate of missing persons of all communities, as well as the release of remaining political and other prisoners. Judging by our constructive meetings in Belgrade, we believe that UNMIK can work with Yugoslav authorities to achieve progress in the five areas highlighted by President Kostunica, in order to encourage full Kosovo Serb participation in the election process.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">We expect Kosovar Albanian leaders to shoulder their share of the responsibility for improving the security situation so that a real process of return of displaced persons can commence.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">We will do our share and fulfil our commitments to Kosovo. But this is a two-way street. All involved must do their part. Creating security and conditions for return cannot be left to the United Nations and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) alone. It is up to Kosovar leaders to demonstrate in deeds the political will to create a multi-ethnic society that is ready for meaningful self-rule in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We did not support a community which had suffered repression and violence only to see members of that same community inflict suffering on others. Those who fought for their own rights must now stand up for the equal rights of others.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">There are obviously mutual links between, on the one hand, Kosovo Serb security and the return of Kosovo Serbs, and, on the other hand, Kosovo Serbs' participation in the interim institutions. Therefore, Belgrade leaders, for their part, should further promote Serbs' interests by helping UNMIK identify and influence interlocutors committed to the integration of Serbs in Kosovo. This is not least the case in Mitrovica, which is a major challenge. Norway supports the comprehensive and balanced strategy outlined by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General during our visit: a persistent political process, involving close cooperation with Belgrade, to replace parallel structures in Mitrovica with confidence-building measures and security provided by KFOR, UNMIK police and the Kosovo Police Service, with Serb participation. This must be carefully conducted, and another exodus must be avoided by ensuring that Mitrovica Serbs have at least the same sense of security as they have now.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">We welcome KFOR's efforts to deal with the regional security situation, as outlined by the KFOR Commander. This includes the increased efforts to prevent ethnic Albanian extremist activities across the Macedonian border, as well as KFOR's contribution to the positive developments in southern Serbia. The international community's successful cooperation with Belgrade in the Presevo valley shows that more can be achieved through political means and confidence-building measures than by the use of force.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Norway for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">I will now yield and, instead of making a statement in my national capacity, give the floor to the countries that have been invited under rule 37. First on that list is the representative of Sweden. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Schori</span> <span class="nation">Sweden</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated countries Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European Free Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area, Iceland and Liechtenstein, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">The EU would like to thank the presidency of the Security Council for the report on the Security Council mission on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We also thank the Secretary-General for his report on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), dated 7 June, and Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his briefing here today.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">The European Union reiterates its strong support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, in his efforts to ensure the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We welcome the promulgation by Hans Haekkerup of the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government in Kosovo and the announcement of Kosovo-wide elections to be held on 17 November of this year. The Constitutional Framework is a landmark step in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and constitutes a decisive move towards the establishment of meaningful and democratic self-government in Kosovo. We urge all individuals and communities in Kosovo to participate actively and constructively in the election process and in the future provisional institutions of self-government. The EU welcomes the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Government's support for the registration of Kosovo Serbs, and calls upon Belgrade to continue to cooperate with UNMIK in order to ensure their participation in the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">The EU supports the mission's findings that there is a need for intensified efforts on issues such as increased security for all communities, in particular for the Kosovo Serbs; freedom of movement; the fate of missing persons; and the return of refugees and displaced persons. We welcome the efforts made by UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in this regard and agree with the Security Council mission's assessment that there is a need for continued and enhanced dialogue between UNMIK and Belgrade in order to ensure the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">Both the report of Security Council mission and the report of the Secretary-General point to the fact that the level of violence and crime in Kosovo, in particular that directed against ethnic minorities, remains unacceptably high. Concerted efforts to enhance the overall security situation in Kosovo are of vital importance to the stability of the province and the entire region. We support recent measures taken by UNMIK and KFOR to counter illegal border crossings and the illegal possession of arms, as well as the adoption of a regulation to help combat terrorism in Kosovo. The EU welcomes the timely establishment of a new UNMIK pillar intended to provide greater focus and coordination in the field of police, security and justice. We are convinced that the new pillar represents an important instrument in combating violence and crime in Kosovo, and look forward to a comprehensive UNMIK strategy for the justice sector. The EU also supports efforts to develop a strategy to defuse tensions and resolve the complex situation in northern Kosovo, in particular in Mitrovica.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">The EU welcomes the unilateral demobilization by ethnic Albanian armed groups in south-east Serbia and the peaceful completion of the return of Yugoslav security forces to the ground safety zone, and in this context expresses its appreciation for the constructive efforts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Government. The European Union has worked closely with other international organizations, in particular the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to bring the parties together and reach a peaceful solution to the crisis. The EU encourages the Belgrade authorities and ethnic Albanian representatives to make rapid progress on the implementation of necessary confidence-building measures, including the establishment of a multi-ethnic police force, the return of all displaced persons and the integration of the ethnic Albanian population into local political, economic and social structures. The European Union Monitoring Mission will retain its presence in the area in order to contribute to this process.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">The EU remains deeply concerned about the serious security situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. At its recent summit in Gothenburg, the European Council reaffirmed its strong attachment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the need for a political solution to the crisis. It is important that KFOR maintain a robust border control and take a firm stance against ethnic Albanian extremists operating from Kosovo. The EU calls on ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo and political leaders in Albania to use their influence to isolate extremists and prevent the spread of violence, which constitutes a threat to the stability of the whole region.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">The European Union fully supports the intensified dialogue on inter-ethnic relations launched by President Trajkovski, and stands ready to engage further in facilitation of the political dialogue. To this end, the EU has decided to appoint a representative, resident in Skopje, who will act under the authority of the High Representative, Mr. Javier Solana, who is now in Skopje himself.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">The EU is firmly committed to continuing its efforts, in close cooperation with all main partners and organizations, to promote stability, democratic development and prosperity in the region.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01"> I now give the floor to the representative of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sahovi</span> <span class="nation">Yugoslavia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank you, personally, Mr. President, and all members of the Council for your efforts to bring about the mission whose results we are discussing today. I am also grateful to Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his analysis and presentation.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">We view the discussions that the mission had in Yugoslavia, in Kosovo and Metohija and in Belgrade as very useful. The visit provided an opportunity for all members of the Council to acquire first-hand information on the situation on the ground and assess challenges that the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) is facing in the very complex period that is ahead of us. This kind of active involvement of the Council is, we believe, important and very helpful for the process of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">Another equally significant aspect of the mission is the Council's visit to Belgrade. The exchange of views with President Kostunica, Minister Svilanovi and other members of our Government was in our assessment detailed, open and constructive. Yugoslavia is committed to continuing to cooperate with the international community, particularly with the Security Council, UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in resolving difficult problems in Kosovo and Metohija.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">We support the position of the Security Council mission that the political process in Kosovo and Metohija has to be further promoted in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. That indeed requires substantial additional efforts by UNMIK, KFOR and UNMIK police, as well as the full attention of the Security Council. We also agree with the assessment that basic obstacles to the creation of a multi-ethnic Kosovo and Metohija are the lack of physical, social and economic security for the population, as well as the lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services. Furthermore, we recognize the importance of the establishment of the new Pillar I and UNMIK's recent measures to combat organized crime, illegal weapons possession and terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">Yugoslavia has repeatedly emphasized that it supports in principle the elections in Kosovo and Metohija and the creation of interim institutions in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, especially its provision regarding respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. Therefore, we have called on the Serbian community to take part in the registration process for the election.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">However, whether Kosovo Serbs will actually go to the polls will depend on whether the conditions for free and fair elections really exist at that time. Unfortunately, so far these conditions have not been created: there is no minimum physical safety, particularly for the non-Albanian population; the remaining Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija cannot go from one place to another without an armed escort. In such conditions, we find it difficult to expect to even hold an election campaign, let alone vote.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">It is difficult to contend that participating in an election is a precondition for a life in safety. On the other hand, in the absence of safety, there are no conditions for democratic elections. Minority protection is not contingent upon the will of minorities to take part in self-governing institutions, but their safety will enable their meaningful participation in these institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">As the situation stands now, Kosovo and Metohija is on the way to being totally transformed into a mono-ethnic community. Two thirds of the Serb population and many members of other ethnic communities have left for other parts of the country. Pristina has been practically cleansed: of its 40,000 Serbs only 200 have remained. The process of the return of displaced persons to Kosovo and Metohija has not yet started. Actually, flight out of the province continues on a daily basis. The return of internally displaced persons should begin immediately, at least to certain areas of Kosovo and Metohija where that can be achieved in safety. Such a step would be completely in line with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, which calls for the return of all forcibly displaced persons without any additional or special conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">I will not elaborate on the issue of the Constitutional Framework. Our position is well known, and it was summarized in the letter I addressed to you, Mr. President, earlier this month. It is our view that relevant legislation should be enacted to improve the content of the Framework and that additional confidence-building measures be put in place to offer the Serbs and other non-Albanians protection so that they can live side by side with others in the province.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">It is necessary to ensure institutional links between Kosovo Serbs and the authorities in Belgrade. In this context, we call for the establishment of cooperation in the fields of education, public health and in particular the protection of cultural heritage. Furthermore, we believe that tax collection points should be set up farther inside the territory of Kosovo and Metohija, since their maintenance at the administrative boundary with Serbia would create an impression that Kosovo and Metohija is actually an independent State.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">Finally, we are of the view that taking into account the good and useful cooperation existing between the Yugoslav Army, the Yugoslav Ministry of Interior and KFOR in southern Serbia, there is no reason why similar cooperation concerning Kosovo and Metohija should not be ensured. I should also like to reiterate once again my Government's readiness and commitment to further intensify cooperation with UNMIK. In this connection, a status-of-mission agreement regulating Federal Republic of Yugoslavia-UNMIK cooperation is urgently required. It would significantly facilitate cooperation and would be in line with established United Nations practice for missions of a similar nature.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa12">In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the willingness of Yugoslavia to do everything in its power to contribute to the improvement of the situation in Kosovo and Metohija, for the benefit of all its inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01"> The next speaker is the representative of Albania. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nesho</span> <span class="nation">Albania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your excellent leadership and the strong commitment that you have shown as the President of the Security Council this month. The Albanian Government highly appreciates the two missions of the Security Council to Kosovo headed by you, which have been successful and have assisted in the policy of the international community for peace and stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">On 12 June 1999, the first international peacekeeping troops of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) were deployed in Kosovo, together with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Since then, the Albanian Government has followed with great attention and interest the developments in Kosovo. We think that there has been a lot of progress in Kosovo, which is reflected in the promotion of the democratization process, the return of refugees, improved security, economic reconstruction and other equally important achievements. On this occasion, we would like to commend the great work of UNMIK and KFOR and stand ready to support it and to make our own contribution to this process.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">The holding of the first-ever free municipal elections in the history of Kosovo was a very successful undertaking of the international community and the political forces of Kosovo. Those elections testified to the fact that the Albanians of Kosovo are fully determined to embrace democratic values and standards. With these elections, Kosovo undertook an important step towards building institutions and the democratic process.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">The Albanian Government fully supports the holding of general elections in Kosovo. These elections will create the central institutions and increase the responsibility of the Kosovar Albanians in the process of self-governance. The United Nations and the political forces in Kosovo should work together in preparing the appropriate steps which will contribute to building confidence and the achievement of a multi-ethnic Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">First, efforts should be stepped up to resolve the issue of missing persons and the release of all prisoners, a problem that continues to be an impeding factor against the process of reconciliation among the ethnic groups in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">Secondly, the international community and the Belgrade regime should try to influence the Serb community in Mitrovica to abandon the policy of cantonization and the isolation of Mitrovica. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> aims at creating a free and democratic society in Kosovo in which all members are free and equal. The solution to the problem of Mitrovica will not only eradicate a source of tension and conflict, but also serve to create a feeling of responsibility among the Albanians of Kosovo for respecting all of the democratic rules and for living in equal co-existence with the other ethnic groups. We welcome the recommendation of the Security Council mission regarding the situation in Mitrovica on the need for multi-ethnic initiatives in the social, economic and religious areas with the objective of rebuilding confidence between the communities, in particular in the field of economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">Thirdly, in order to achieve the necessary confidence and reconciliation in Kosovo, the Albanians should work further to respect the rights of the minorities. At the same time, the minorities, in particular the Serb minority, should understand that only by participating in the process of democratic institution-building and in the upcoming general elections will they contribute to the goal of a multi-ethnic Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">We think that there can be no discussion on the final status of Kosovo without having in place the central institutions, including the Government and the Assembly of Kosovo. Only these bodies will have the legitimate right to negotiate with the international community on this very important issue. The will of the people of Kosovo should be respected as a fundamental element of the right to self-determination.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">We support the continued presence of UNMIK and KFOR in Kosovo, which are guarantees for preserving peace and stability there. Evaluating the situation and the great efforts of the United Nations to achieve its goals, we believe it important that this Organization remain in Kosovo as a guarantor of the process in the future. As a neighbouring country, Albania would like to establish broad cooperation with Kosovo with the objective of Kosovo's becoming a model for the entire region. It is in this context that the Albanian Government has proposed and asked for financial assistance to the structures of the Stability Pact for the reconstruction of the road from Durrës to Pristina.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">The issue of Kosovo is as old as traditional European policy towards the Balkans -- a policy of creating zones of influence and of solving the problem by the imposition of force and dominance -- embodied in international treaties and agreements over the past two centuries. The tendency of some countries today to solve the issue in the traditional way, without respecting the new reality in the Balkans, will surely provoke insecurity and tension and keep the region unstable. We think that only the continuation of the democratic process and the integration of Kosovo into the European Union is the right perspective for peace and stability in the Balkans. We believe that the contribution of the international community in Kosovo will soon yield the necessary result of strengthening peace and stability in the region. This process will always be easier and fair when the will of the people corresponds with the interests of the international community.</p>

Bangladesh agrees fully with the findings of the mission, as contained in paragraphs 29-39 of the report in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-600.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/600</a>. We expect that these findings will prompt concrete actions by all concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa04">My delegation, which also joined the first mission to Kosovo in April 2000, was impressed by the marked improvement in overall economic activity in the area, particularly in Pristina. I will touch on three points: a multi-ethnic Kosovo, democracy and the role of civil society in general and women's groups in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa05">On the first point, we believe that a peaceful future in Kosovo -- or, for that matter, in the greater region -- hinges on the greater tolerance and mutual accommodation of different ethnic entities. Although some progress has been made in the last two years, wounds are still open, mistrust is widespread and ethnically motivated violence active. The only practical way out of this is to significantly improve the environment so that all communities feel safe and secure, which will contribute much to confidence-building and thereby lay the foundation of a truly multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. In this context, Bangladesh emphatically reiterates its earlier assertions that the resolution of the issue of missing persons and detainees is crucially important for the healing process to begin.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa06">The Security Council mission to Kosovo last week very appropriately carried a strong message urging the communities to do their utmost to create such a society. Broad participation in the political process is a crucial step towards the creation of a multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. The Kosovars should not allow the past to pull them back and should look ahead to the potentials of the future. Promoting a culture of peace and non-violence, particularly focusing on the children and young people, is crucial to the success of these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa07">My second point is on democracy. The democratic process in Kosovo had a hesitant, but positive start with the holding of municipal elections in Kosovo last year. Some success has been achieved in the representation of different communities in the interim institutions, although the political engagement of the Kosovo Serbs has remained a challenge. The authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have an important role to play in this engagement. The encouragement by President Kostunica of civil registration for the Kosovo-wide elections in November of this year has already had a positive effect. The difficulties being faced in organizing broad participation in the upcoming elections must be pursued with all earnestness. The Council mission last week left with the impression that it was unacceptable to continue on the basis of the status quo.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa08">The third point relates to the role of civil society in general and women's groups in particular. Bangladesh is very pleased that it was possible for the mission members to meet with the representatives of women's non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Kosovo. We believe that the international community should increase its support to enable NGOs and women's groups to reach across the ethnic divide. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> provides for greater participation in peace negotiations and in the political process by women. Such involvement of women's groups and networks in Kosovo needs to be ensured by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). We hope that UNMIK will take immediate steps to work closely with these groups which are committed to the broader objectives of the United Nations in their work. Bangladesh strongly believes that civil society in Kosovo has played a significant role in enhancing the objectives of a multi-ethnic society and that it will continue to be an effective ally of UNMIK and its work.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa09">Let me conclude by paying tribute to all those who are working in Kosovo, with dedication and enthusiasm, as part of a difficult and complex United Nations mission. Also, Bangladesh commends the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Hans Haekkerup, for his determined leadership as the head of UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa10">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa11">There are no further speakers inscribed on my list. The Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
