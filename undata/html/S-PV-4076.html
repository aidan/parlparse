We are grateful for the assistance and understanding that members have rendered to the presidency throughout this month, for the moral support and for the great spirit in which the Council worked in the month of November.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa02">We are particularly grateful to Mr. Stephanides and Ms. Blenman and their team for the very efficient support and assistance which has been ever available to the President of the Security Council. They have helped greatly in overcoming a variety of technical and other obstacles to the work of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">I would like to express today our particular admiration for the interpreters, who have been with us for many long hours, showing great patience and professionalism. They have made our agreements and differences perfectly understood. This has helped us in our work.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa04">We are grateful to the entire staff of the Secretariat, all the document officers, technicians, conference room officers, security officers and others who make the operation of the Security Council possible. The Security Council is a complex mechanism, and without all this support it would not be able to organize its work.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa05">This has been an interesting and exciting month. I believe that the Council has taken several important decisions. I think that we can conclude this month with a certain degree of satisfaction.</p>
