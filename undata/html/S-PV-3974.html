	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the escalating violence in Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It underlines the risk of a further deterioration in the humanitarian situation if steps are not taken by the parties to reduce tensions.

The Council demands that the parties should accept their responsibilities and comply fully with these decisions and requirements, as with its relevant resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for international efforts, including those of the Contact Group and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Kosovo Verification Mission, to reduce tensions in Kosovo and facilitate a political settlement on the basis of substantial autonomy and equality for all citizens and ethnic communities in Kosovo and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Kosovo Albanians and other communities in Kosovo. It reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council will follow the negotiations closely and would welcome members of the Contact Group keeping it informed about the progress reached therein.</p>
