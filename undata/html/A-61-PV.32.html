	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">The five outgoing non-permanent members are the following: Argentina, Denmark, Greece, Japan and the United Republic of Tanzania. Those five States cannot be re-elected. Their names, therefore, should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in the year 2007 the following States: the Congo, Ghana, Peru, Qatar and Slovakia. The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">Of the five non-permanent members that will remain in office in the year 2007, three are from Africa and Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: two from Africa and Asia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean and two from Western Europe and other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa06">In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to be elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa and one from Asia.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa07">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa08">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>

For the two vacant seats from among the African and Asian States, there are three candidates, namely, Indonesia, Nepal and South Africa. Of those three candidates, South Africa is an endorsed candidate. For the one vacant seat from among the Latin America and Caribbean States, there are two candidates, namely, Guatemala and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
