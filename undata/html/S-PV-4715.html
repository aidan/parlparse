<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guéhenno</span> <span class="non-nation">Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I welcome this opportunity to introduce to the members of the Security Council the special report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Before presenting the report, however, I wish to formally express the Secretariat's regret and sadness at the news of the tragic loss last week of five UNMISET Blue Helmets from the Republic of Korea. As Council members may be aware, those young soldiers lost their lives when they were swept away in a swollen river in the Oecussi district. Three of them drowned as a result of their brave efforts to rescue their compatriots. This tragic accident reminds us of the perils that our dedicated peacekeepers face every day; it reminds us of the tremendous sacrifices that they and their families make and of the enormous debt we owe to them. I should like once more to express our sincere condolences to the Government of the Republic of Korea and to the families of the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I should now like to turn to the report and to examine its key recommendations and their underlying logic. In much of the information that we have communicated to the Security Council over the past three and a half years -- first on East Timor and then on Timor-Leste -- we have been able to cite remarkable successes. Those have included the establishment of a public administration, two peaceful elections and Timor-Leste's independence nearly a year ago.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Unfortunately, the report before the Council today has a different focus. This is not a general report on progress towards implementation of the mandate; that report will be forthcoming at the end of April or beginning of May, as UNMISET's first year draws to a close. This is, rather, an effort to sound an alarm at a critical time, to indicate to the Council a number of worrisome developments and to recommend, in good time, what we consider realistic and prudent adjustments of UNMISET's troop-reduction plans so as to reflect a situation on the ground that has changed and to protect the considerable investments that the international community has made in Timor-Leste.</p>

<div class="italicline-spokein" id="pg002-bk09">
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01"><i>spoke in English</i></p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guéhenno</span> <span class="non-nation">Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">The report of the Secretary-General notes that the success story in Timor-Leste appears to be threatened by two types of developments in the security environment. First, there have been threats and incidents of civil disturbance, the most significant being the destructive riot in Dili on 4 December last year -- although there have been other riots, including one in Baucau in November. Secondly, there has been a rise in armed groups in rural areas, particularly in the west of the country. Prominent activities carried out by such groups are the killings in Ermera on 4 January and in Bobonaro on 24 February. Much about these groups remains unclear, but they appear to be driven by a blend of political and criminal motivations and to be drawing on a variety of sources of support.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The report then identifies obstacles to increased reliance upon the Timorese capacity to address such threats. These kinds of tasks are not best suited for the Timor-Leste defence force (Falintil-FDTL) in terms of its mandate, its equipment or its present training. Nor is it realistic to propose that the Timorese police (PNTL) assume a substantially greater role in addressing these most difficult types of security challenges for another year. Seeking to rely upon these agencies prematurely, or in ways that are inappropriate, could compromise their training, set bad precedents and harm their standing in the community.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">At the same time, the downsizing plans that were prepared nine months ago, at a far more peaceful time, would make it increasingly difficult for UNMISET to give the Timorese agencies the time they need to develop fully.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">According to the original plans for the operation, further downsizing in the middle of this year would see the removal of around 750 infantry, primarily those located in the south-west. With only 2,580 infantry in the military component at present, this is a reduction of around a third in the very capacity needed if UNMISET is to respond effectively to armed groups.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">This would make it difficult to maintain the regular and frequent presence in rural areas that is crucial to obtain information on evolving threats. It would inhibit UNMISET's ability to concentrate its forces in response to threat groups. It could force the Mission to make undesirable choices; thus, if the military had to assist in dealing with a further riot in Dili next August, this would likely require relocation of forces from the west that would open the door to infiltration by threat groups on an opportunity basis. This is assuming that the level of problems stays the same; it does not factor in the risk that such downsizing could in itself encourage greater problems, by sending the wrong signal to potential troublemakers.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">As for the international police, it currently has no remaining crowd-control capability. At the same time, it lacks the specialized training capabilities that are required to ensure the most effective, rapid and thorough development of its Timorese counterparts.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">For these reasons, the report to the Security Council includes two kinds of recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">First, the report proposes an enhancement of the Mission's ability to support development of the Timorese police. This will entail recruitment of personnel with the ability to train in such areas as crowd control, police administration, finance, logistics, forensics, tactical operations, border security and community policing, and a renewed emphasis on human rights training. It suggests retaining a higher number of police advisers in districts where Timorese police have assumed responsibility for patrolling. Furthermore, UNMISET police, in coordination with donors, will also be working with the Government to develop its strategy to follow up recommendations of the report of the Joint Assessment Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">At the same time, as a short-term measure to strengthen the Mission's operational capacity to deal with the threat posed by armed groups, the report proposes a delay in the downsizing of the military component and its reconfiguration in key areas, including increasing mobility. It may be useful to note that the last time the peacekeeping operation faced significant armed activity was nearly a year ago, when the operation included over 5,000 troops. The report also underlines the importance of the reduction of restrictions on military components by troop-contributing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">Finally, the report suggests deployment of a formed police company, which would help the Mission to deal with civil disturbance and crowd control.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa11">I would like to note that the report does not propose deferring the operation's withdrawal date, nor does it propose a new overall strategy; this remains the establishment of a sustainable Timorese structure that can maintain security after UNMISET leaves. But a premature downsizing of the Mission could imperil that strategy, as the security situation could rapidly deteriorate, and the development of Timorese capacity could suffer.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa12">While my remarks today have necessarily focused on the problems that remain, I wish also to draw to the Security Council's attention a major positive development. This is the conclusion of the agreements and legislative processes in Timor-Leste and in Australia that should pave the way for exploitation of mineral resources in the Timor Sea. The development of these resources is of cardinal importance for Timor-Leste's economic future. But the hope that this progress implies could be undermined unless security issues are resolved.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa13">The decision before the Security Council is a difficult one. As I mentioned, much about the new threat groups in Timor-Leste -- their scale, sources of support and motivation -- remains ambiguous. But it is already apparent that they exceed the capability of regular police -- either international or Timorese.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa14">Furthermore, the information that we continue to receive has generally increased, rather than allayed, our concern. This included the information obtained since the report, during UNMISET's efforts to find the attackers in Bobonaro, when peacekeepers came across a campsite with considerable military equipment, including firearms, nearly 1,000 rounds of ammunition and military packs.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa15">We are here seeking to provide the Council with the information it needs, and with recommendations that we believe appropriate. In the light of past experience, we would urge that the Council consider the following key questions.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa16">In a fragile but unclear situation, should the international community continue to seek a more "minimalist" approach, which was first mooted in the more optimistic pre-independence period?</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa17">Or, as is strongly supported by military expertise here and in Dili, should the international community lean towards prudence and make the additional effort suggested here?</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa18">These recommendations are presented on the premise that it is easier and less expensive to pre-empt a problem than to try to fix a problem after it has occurred. The cost that is implied would be modest compared to the $1 billion to $2 billion that the international community has spent in Timor-Leste over the past three years. However, we believe that this additional effort could help secure the much larger investment that has been made to date.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa19">Members of the Security Council, together with troop contributors and other Member States, have already made an outstanding contribution to Timor-Leste. We hope that, in the midst of competing demands, the Security Council can continue to ensure that Timor-Leste gets the resources and attention that it needs and can bring to fruition the extraordinary efforts it has made to date.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Guéhenno for his briefing.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdés</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on the outstanding manner in which you have been guiding our work this month. I should like also to thank you, on behalf of the delegation of Chile, for having convened this meeting to consider the report of the Secretary-General dated 3 March on the situation in Timor-Leste. We would like also to extend our gratitude to Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, for his presentation this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">We wish also to offer our condolences to the Government of the Republic of Korea regarding the sad and tragic accident that took place on 6 March in which five of its nationals -- members of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) -- lost their lives.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Last November an open meeting of the Security Council was held to discuss the progress made during Timor-Leste's first six months as an independent country, and we welcomed those achievements, although we identified the challenges that lay ahead. However, we saw the situation begin to change radically as of 4 December 2002. The very serious civil unrest and subsequent violence have changed the security outlook in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">That is why we have considered with particular attention the references made to these events in the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General. The events that took place in the town of Atsabe in January, in which five pro-independence workers were killed, and the attack on a bus in the Bobonaro district, in which two people were killed and five injured, are certainly alarming.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">We also share the concern about the possible resurgence of militia activity and armed groups, which are establishing bases within Timor-Leste with the intention of undermining stability in that country. We also recognize that the situation of the more than 28,000 refugees remaining in Indonesia is an added factor for instability. In that context, we are interested in the resettlement initiatives that the Indonesian Government has described.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">We also understand the importance of delineating and demarcating the border and to that end we urge the Joint Border Commission between the Governments of Timor-Leste and Indonesia to accelerate the implementation of their work plan.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">We share the view that an effective national police force that is reliable and well-regarded by the population is indispensable. We therefore appreciate the work done by UNMISET that has allowed the Timor-Leste national police to station 2,530 personnel in six of the 13 districts of the country. We understand, however, that this is an ongoing process and that the national police is in no position to contend with the more serious threats to security that are now arising.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">That is why we believe that the proposed changes are very valid. These include the addition of an international police unit for one year; the ongoing intensive training of the police force; emphasis on human rights and the rule of law in the context of the development and certification process; and an enhanced monitoring and advisory presence in districts where responsibilities have already been assigned.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">In the military sector, taking into account the current limitations of the Timor-Leste defence force -- its extremely small personnel, its lack of presence in the Western sectors of the territory and the need to improve its mobility by air and land, inter alia -- we believe that the two-phase adjustments to the military strategy and configuration, as proposed by UNMISET, are relevant.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">That is why we consider it very important, on the basis of the Secretary-General's report, to consider and discuss these issues in-depth in the Council, particularly in light of the experience of members with troops in the area, so that we may agree on consensus-based mechanisms to address the current security situation in Timor-Leste. We agree with the proposal that the plans under development should be kept under constant review and that the Council should be advised in a timely fashion about any improvement or worsening of security conditions, including recommendations to allow us to adopt measures adequate to the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">Our concern over the situation in the country cannot prevent us from acknowledging the efforts that have been made by President Gusmão since assuming the reins of Government in May. We value his leadership and initiatives on foreign policy, as well as his support for and work within the United Nations system since his country's accession to membership in September. We were also glad to learn of the signing of economic agreements between Timor-Leste and Australia to exploit Timor-Leste's available natural resources.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">In that context, we wish to avail ourselves of Mr. Guéhenno's presence to ask him about work undertaken in the past few months in the various areas of the national development plan. We know that progress has been made on the scheduled tasks.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I should like at the outset most particularly to thank the Secretary-General for his report on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor. We also wish to thank Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, for his briefing on the report and on the latest developments in the situation in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The international community has played an important role in ensuring peace and stability in Timor-Leste. We are all duty-bound to preserve our achievements. Developments over the past three years have shown that the path on which that country has embarked has led to even greater success and will guarantee its development, progress and independence.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The Secretary-General's report -- the second submitted since Timor-Leste's accession to independence -- is of special importance in its reference to certain key issues. In the military and security context in particular, it refers to concerns over the security situation in that country. We share the Secretary-General's concerns in that regard. The report's conclusions and recommendations on adjusting the Mission's plans are therefore especially important.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">In this connection, we particularly support the Secretary-General's request regarding adjustments to the Mission and the downsizing of its personnel. We support the revised military strategy to adjust the military component and to implement a simplified two-phase programme for the redeployment of personnel, to conclude in May 2004. We also support the revised strategy for the police component and believe that, pursuant to the report, there is a need for another year to ensure further progress before the Timor-Leste police is able to tackle all its responsibilities. We feel that this is a wise and well-rounded idea.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">We should also like to express our gratitude for the ongoing cooperation between Timor-Leste and Indonesia to which the report refers. We await the delimitation of the border, scheduled to be completed by June.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">In discussing progress in Timor-Leste, we must refer to the importance of the economic factor in development and of the provision of necessary resources to ensure economic and social development. We therefore urge all donors to continue to provide constant assistance to enable that country to move beyond the current phase of reconstruction and to help the Government in its efforts to ensure the implementation of its national development plan.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tafrov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, you were right to choose the present format for this meeting on the special report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>) as the situation in Timor-Leste is cause for concern, as Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno has just said -- and I thank him for introducing the report. It is quite natural for the Council to meet to discuss the proposals put forward by the Secretariat in the special report.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">I would like to welcome the presence of José Luis Guterres, Permanent Representative of Timor-Leste. I would also like to inform the Council that on 20 January, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, Solomon Passy, and Ambassador Guterres signed an act establishing diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">I would also like to express my country's condolences to the Government of the Republic of Korea on the loss of five of their soldiers who took part in UNMISET.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">As Jean-Marie Guéhenno said just now, until now we were used to speaking of Timor-Leste in an optimistic tone. Unfortunately, events in recent months with respect to the security situation in that young country no longer encourage such optimism. We believe that the Security Council must take note of the worsening security situation and act cautiously.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">Previous speakers mentioned the incidents in Dili on 4 December 2002 and those in the region of the city of Atsabe on 4 January, as well as the incidents in the region of Bobonaro, which had several victims. Those incidents jeopardize the efforts of UNMISET and the forces of order of Timor-Leste, which seek to normalize the situation in the country. It is important that those incidents be investigated and that their perpetrators be brought before the courts. Appropriate measures must be taken with respect to threats from former militia personnel and armed groups in remote areas, as well as to fight crime.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">UNMISET is an invaluable instrument in normalizing the situation in Timor-Leste. We take this opportunity to thank the men and women of UNMISET for their excellent work.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">The special report of the Secretary-General envisages modifying the strategy of UNMISET in the light of the events of recent months. It seems to us that the report's conclusions are logical, and we support them.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">At the bilateral level, my country is attempting to contribute to the normalization of the situation in Timor-Leste, a young country of which the United Nations is rightly proud. We are trying to develop assistance programmes for weapons, which the nascent armed forces and police urgently need.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">The donor community must continue its engagement on Timor-Leste. Any withdrawal by donors would have a terrible effect on the stability that has been achieved at the cost of significant efforts by the international community.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">This is the first time that my delegation is speaking in the Council on the subject of Timor-Leste since the independence of that country last May. At that time, the Secretary-General summed up the sentiments of the entire United Nations membership when he said to the people of Timor-Leste:</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">"You should be very proud of your achievement. That a small nation is able to inspire the world and be the focus of our attention is the highest tribute I can pay to you."</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">The Secretary-General added: "While your determination ensured the success of your cause, you have also been helped by friends from all over the world".</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Indeed, Pakistan is proud of its modest contribution to the emergence of Timor-Leste as an independent State. One of our most distinguished diplomats and my predecessor during Pakistan's last tenure on the Security Council, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker, served as the Secretary-General's Personal Representative on East Timor. Ambassador Marker conducted critical negotiations which facilitated the way for the independence of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Pakistan is also proud to have been one of the largest troop contributors to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, which oversaw the transition of the country to an independent State. We are pleased to be still present in Timor-Leste, as part of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). Our commitment to the peace, stability and independence of Timor-Leste remains undiminished. We are also proud of Pakistan's role over the years as a leading advocate of the right of peoples to self-determination. We have upheld this right often at a time when the world has forgotten the promises it has made to peoples struggling under foreign occupation and alien domination. Pakistan has helped to keep the flame of freedom and self-determination alive, especially within the United Nations over the last 50 years.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">We are therefore gratified to see the realization of the aspirations of the people of Timor-Leste. Let us take this opportunity to remind the Council of its other promises which have not been realized and to appeal to the Council to show consistency, and not selectivity, in its decisions. Let us work also to resolve the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council and the promises of the Council to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">In this context, I would like to quote a remark about Kashmir made by one noble fighter for freedom:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg006-bk02-pa08">"They have now been waiting 50 years for a chance to express their own resolve in a plebiscite mandated by the United Nations shortly after the Indian-Pakistani partition. ... It is thus time, before this conflict ignites an even greater tragedy, for all parties to take pause and finally endorse the will of the Kashmiri people, the United Nations and the founding fathers of these two great nations. I therefore urge everyone wishing to bring peace, democracy and social justice to this troubled region to join in supporting a free, fair and binding plebiscite for all the people of Kashmir, so that the world may finally know and abide by their long-deferred aspirations."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">Those are not the words of a Pakistani; they are the words of His Excellency José Ramos-Horta, Nobel Peace Laureate, now Foreign Minister of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">Timor has been a triumph for self-determination. It is rightfully referred to as one of the success stories of the United Nations. For that reason we share the concern which has been expressed in this Chamber about recent events. Pakistan has always advocated that no peacekeeping operation should be terminated if it has not achieved its mandated objectives. While we are confident that the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) will indeed complete the tasks assigned to it, the security situation in Timor-Leste has now become its priority consideration. We feel that the scheduled downsizing of UNMISET at this stage would not be desirable. Therefore, Pakistan, both as a member of the Council and as a troop contributor to UNMISET, fully supports the recommendations of the Secretary-General to delay the downsizing until December 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">We also support the adjustments in the military and police compositions, as proposed by the Secretariat. Pakistan further believes that the international community, especially the donor community, as well as the neighbours of Timor-Leste, must help the Government and people to improve their economic situation. The economic recovery of the country is essential in order to restore hope and generate stability. Pakistan welcomes in particular the growing institutional cooperation between the Governments of Indonesia and of Timor-Leste. We strongly believe that the growing ties between those two countries is the surest guarantee for peace in Timor-Leste and for prosperity for the region as a whole. We urge both countries to continue to strengthen their bilateral relations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">In closing, I would like to recall that, in Dili last year, the Secretary-General made a commitment, on behalf of all of us, to the people and the Government of Timor-Leste. He said,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg006-bk02-pa13">"Let me assure you that independence will not mean the end of the world's commitment to you. The United Nations will stay. Your friends around the world will continue to help. We will all work together to ensure that the first years of independence are years of stability and progress."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa14">Pakistan would urge that we abide by that commitment.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Thomson</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I would like first of all the thank Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his briefing and to express gratitude to the Secretary-General for the report on which it was based. We think that it is right for the Secretariat to sound a warning bell, as Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno put it, when it judges that to be necessary. Whether or not we agree with the conclusions is a different matter, but it is quite right to express concern about the situation when the Secretariat judges it to be necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">I should like to concentrate my remarks on the country of Timor-Leste, specifically the recommendations in the Secretary-General's report for the military and police configuration there. But before I do so, I should like to join others in expressing condolences to the Government and the people of the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Like previous speakers, the United Kingdom fully recognizes the importance of ensuring that the investments that the international community has made and the achievements that the Timorese people and Government have accomplished are not undermined. We agree with the Secretary-General's report that recent security problems in Timor-Leste, and the way in which they were handled, have lent weight to the argument in favour of adjustments to the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), and we agree that changes should be made. We therefore broadly support the measures outlined in paragraph 22 of the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">I listened carefully to Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno's description of the current security situation, but we continue to be unconvinced that the security problems in Timor-Leste, as they stand at present, warrant maintaining peacekeeping force troops at the present level all the way to December 2003. We feel that under current downsizing plans there would still be sizeable numbers of troops to deal with the acts of the small armed gangs. Nevertheless, we would be willing to explore the feasibility of rescheduling the downsizing of the peacekeeping force in a less radical manner than is proposed in the Secretary-General's report, and we look forward to exploring that further.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">On the proposals for a revised policing strategy, we agree that improving the capability of the Timorese police should be the priority. We are willing to consider favourably the Secretary-General's recommendations for rescheduling the downsizing of the United Nations police operation, subject to some clarifications of some of the recommendations. We will pursue those clarifications with the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">In the same framework, we would also like to pursue further information on the budgetary implications of the Secretary-General's proposals.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pujalte</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I should like first of all the thank the Secretary-General for the special report on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) and to express gratitude to Mr. Guéhenno for having introduced it to us.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">Before talking about the report, however, I should like to offer the condolences of the people and the Government of Mexico to the people and the Government of the Republic of Korea for the loss of the five United Nations peacekeepers.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Turning to the report, I would like to point out that it notes the importance of the Security Council's remaining vigilant with regard to developments on the ground and alert to the danger of creating unrealistic expectations that could undermine what has, to date, been a success story for the United Nations. Over the past few months, we have noted the violent incidents that have somewhat affected the progress of Timor-Leste in its efforts to consolidate its status as a nation. Mexico, however, is convinced that the Timor-Leste authorities, under the leadership of President Gusmão, and with the support of the international community, will be able to deal with and overcome those obstacles in the best possible manner.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">My country would like once again to express its gratitude for the work done by UNMISET. We would also like to extend our support to Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma, head of UNMISET, in fully carrying out his mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Mexico shares the goals of consolidating security throughout all of Timor-Leste, improving coordination between international police and the country's security bodies, and strengthening the operation of the national police in responding to civil disturbances.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">It is important to strengthen security during the post-conflict reconstruction phase in order to guarantee a climate conducive to the country's development. As the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>) appropriately points out, unemployment and a lack of training and prospects make it easier to recruit young people to commit acts of violence. Mexico believes that security could be strengthened in the following areas, inter alia: creating an effective local police force, establishing an independent justice system, strengthening the rule of law and national institutions, and promoting and protecting human rights and basic freedoms.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">Cooperation between Timor-Leste and all its neighbours, particularly Indonesia, is of fundamental importance. Finalizing the agreement on the demarcation of borders and dealing with the situation of former militia and Timor-Leste refugees still in West Timor are priorities. In addition to other measures, addressing those issues will serve to improve the situation along the border, where the majority of violent incidents have taken place.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">Given the structural weaknesses that still exist with regard to security -- particularly in the border region -- it is necessary to establish whether the acts that have taken place over the past few months are motivated by political considerations, whether they are connected, whether they are part of an orchestrated campaign, or whether they are the desperate acts of persons trying to regain former perquisites and influence or who perhaps view armed attacks as a booming business.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">In that regard, the opinion shared by the Governments of Timor-Leste and Indonesia to the effect that the acts of violence are not part of any official policy is a positive element. That opinion also holds that in any case such acts involve Indonesian or Timorese individuals acting alone, something that the detention of armed persons in Liquica appears to have confirmed.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">Given all that, Mexico will in good time analyse proposals to strengthen the response capacity of the bodies responsible for security in Timor-Leste, bearing in mind the ultimate goal of ensuring the effective hand-over of responsibilities to the Government of Timor-Leste and strengthening the capacities of the new State so that its viability is guaranteed.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">We are concerned by the mention in the report of the Secretary-General of terrorist threats in Timor-Leste. We would like to know whether that is a concrete threat and, if so, what measures have been taken to confront it. Whatever the case, we must bear in mind the obligation incumbent upon all States -- and therefore upon forces under the command of the United Nations -- to protect the human rights of all persons in the fight against terrorism, as established in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-219.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 57/219</a>, adopted last December.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa12">The international community must maintain the commitment thus far shown towards Timor-Leste. For its part, the United Nations must continue to support the authorities of the new State in this process. It is therefore indispensable to clearly define the responsibilities and competencies of UNMISET's military and police components and those of the police and defence forces of Timor-Leste and to coordinate their activities. It is also important for the United Nations to reaffirm its commitment to the administration of justice in Timor-Leste, as well as to reaffirm its full support for the work of UNMISET's Serious Crimes Unit. Mexico believes that combating impunity must be a priority.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa13">Finally, I would like to reiterate the support of Mexico's Government and people to the Government and people of Timor-Leste. We also express our confidence that this will continue to be a success story.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Williamson</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno for his useful presentation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Before I turn to the proposals we have just heard, let me say two things. First, the United States adds its voice to the condolences expressed to the Republic of Korea over the tragic drowning accident that claimed the lives of five of its peacekeepers in Timor-Leste last week. The Korean contingent has done an outstanding job in the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), and we mourn the loss of those good men. Secondly, on a more positive note, we congratulate the Governments of Timor-Leste and Australia for successfully concluding negotiations on a revenue-sharing agreement for gas and petroleum resources in the Timor Sea. That achievement bodes well for both countries, and it is a very encouraging step for Timor-Leste's economic future.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Like our colleagues in this Chamber, the United States is committed to helping Timor-Leste as it continues its journey to become a viable, secure, sustainable and prosperous State. That is why the United States Government has contributed $82 million in bilateral assistance to the people of Timor-Leste over the last three years, and $400 million to the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor and its predecessor operation in the same period. The United States wants Timor-Leste to succeed, and the United States Government is dedicated to doing all that is required to help that happen. Notwithstanding the isolated incidences of violence, there has been a great deal of progress in Timor-Leste, as reviewed in the Secretary-General's November report (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2002-1223.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1223</a></i>) and as noted this morning by Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno. In particular, we note that the growing cooperation between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is especially encouraging.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">We have carefully reviewed the recommendations made in the Secretary-General's thoughtful report of 3 March (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>). We share the concern of others over the violent incidents that have occurred in the last three months, and we are saddened by the resulting deaths of over 10 people. Violence such as that is always worrisome. We agree that the security situation in Timor-Leste has changed to some degree. The report cites two recent shooting incidents, involving a total of about 40 armed men. Those events are troubling, though we take some comfort from the fact that they are relatively small in scale.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">We are aware that there are rumours of more gunmen lurking in the bush, but those reports, fortunately, seem speculative. We note that UNMISET's mandate gives police, not peacekeepers, the prime responsibility to handle internal security incidents like those witnessed recently. That is the proper division of labour. It is the job of the police to address domestic violence. Peacekeepers can provide backup to the police, but our goal should be for that to happen as a last resort, not as a matter of course. We do not see a compelling case for a peacekeeping draw-down pause, a pause that would actually add 1,000 peacekeepers beyond current draw-down levels. We have difficulty seeing why a peacekeeping force of 2,780 -- the force level by July 2003, per the current drawdown -- would be incapable of helping the police to handle small numbers of bandits or ex-militia members. If a compelling case were made, we could be open to a more modest adjustment in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">It would be welcome if numbers of peacekeepers alone could solve this problem. It would be nice to believe that to pause the drawdown would solve the isolated security incidents. It is tempting to believe that the prudent answer to the isolated incidents of violent activity is to be found in numbers. Numbers, however, do not seem to be the real issue. Recent incidents have occurred with the present level of 3,900 troops in place. There is no reason to believe that keeping this same number will end such incidents. If we freeze troop levels when incidents occur but incidents are still taking place in December, will we not hear the same case made that troop levels should stay at 3,900?</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">We would support a reorientation of the peacekeeping force to better meet the current threat. Units could focus more on tracking down the gunmen behind recent attacks and could redeploy from low-risk to high-risk areas. Some efforts have been made in that regard, but more could be done. Moreover, the United States believes that greater focus should be given to strengthening the capacity of the police. The peacekeepers will ultimately leave Timor-Leste, but the country's police will stay. Relying on peacekeepers as a crutch does nothing to directly strengthen East Timor's own capabilities. It would not be prudent or wise to pretend otherwise. If the police are considered incapable of handling their duties, then let us concentrate on making them capable. That is our challenge; that is the mission of UNMISET.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">We note that the report contains suggestions with regard to adjusting the timing of the transfer of police executive authority and to revamping police training. Another good idea is to consider freezing the drawdown of the United Nations civilian police (CIVPOL) contingent. These proposals on UNMISET's police component are very helpful, but little detail or explanation has been provided by the Secretariat. It would be helpful to have further details on what is wrong with the current CIVPOL programme, on what would be entailed in a restructuring programme and on how much changes would cost.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">We would like to request that the Secretariat come back to the Security Council with a revised proposal that focuses on strengthening the police. The report could also include recommendations on reorienting the peacekeeping force and perhaps on a modest adjustment to peacekeeping troop levels. In considering any changes to UNMISET's way forward, we must be guided by the Mission's fundamental purpose. It is worth reminding ourselves that the goal of UNMISET is not to ensure that Timor-Leste is problem-free, but to ensure that Timor-Leste has the capacity to handle its own problems. Its independence and self-reliance are a proper objective.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">Let me reiterate that the United States strongly believes in Timor-Leste and its future. The Government of the United States is committed to helping the people of that young country enjoy the privileges and responsibilities of their hard-won independence. We will continue to support their efforts to develop a free, secure and prosperous society, and, among our other contributions, we are committed to working through UNMISET towards that end. We share the objectives of the report so thoughtfully presented by Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno today. The international community, the Security Council and UNMISET must remain committed to helping Timor-Leste. Our difficulty is not in the objectives, but in how to achieve them. We believe that the best response to recent developments is a greater focus on strengthening the police.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I should like to join other delegations in expressing my condolences to the Republic of Korea on the occasion of the tragic events of last week.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">I should like to thank the Secretary-General for his latest report on the situation in Timor-Leste (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>) and Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his presentation. We commend the excellent work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, Kamalesh Sharma, and his staff, and we congratulate the people of Timor-Leste and its representatives for the positive achievements in Timor-Leste thus far. Furthermore, Germany welcomes and supports the efforts of the Government of Timor-Leste, under President Gusmão, assisted by the United Nations, to consolidate the still-fragile political institutions and to ensure and uphold democratic institutions and the rule of law while building the new nation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">In spite of the achievements of the past three years and continued progress, there are still major tasks to be accomplished in the months and years ahead. One of the most challenging issues is the building of the Government of Timor-Leste's own capabilities in the field of the military and the police. The urgency of that task was underlined by the rampage in Dili on 4 December last year.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">I think we all agree that the security situation in Timor-Leste remains of major concern for the Government and for the international community, as highlighted in the Secretary-General's report. Our own assessment is that the security situation has indeed deteriorated to some degree in the past three months. However, such incidents have been of a comparatively rather small scale and have involved only a limited number of perpetrators. Furthermore, we are aware of rumours suggesting that former militias and armed groups may be trying to undermine the stability of the new nation, but so far, there seems to be little evidence for those rumours.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">We have given careful thought to the recommendations made in the Secretary-General's report, in particular the proposal to maintain the current strength of the peacekeeping contingents through December 2003 in response to the recent problems in the security sector. I should like to point out that the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) gives the police -- not the peacekeepers -- the prime responsibility for handling internal security incidents. We are not convinced as to the value of that proposal and, for the time being, would rather stick to the plan as provided in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1410 (2002)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Under the UNMISET mandate, peacekeepers should function only as a backup if police capabilities are insufficient or exhausted. We are not convinced that that is indeed the case today. We should therefore like to raise a question as to whether it would not be possible to focus all our efforts on the strengthening of the capabilities of the police force of Timor-Leste by, inter alia, reorienting the police training programme in the light of the new challenges that have emerged in the past months. In that context, we are prepared to consider a recent proposal for a pause in the planned drawdown of the police component. However, we should like first to have a broader discussion on the shortfalls of the current police training programme, and we should like to learn about the possible additional costs involved in that.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">Furthermore, with regard to the peacekeeping force itself, we wonder whether it would not be possible to reorient the force to better meet existing challenges instead of maintaining the number of troops at a higher level than had originally been planned for. Peacekeepers could, for example, be redeployed from low-risk to high-risk areas, and their mobility could be increased.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">In conclusion, we are not convinced whether it is already necessary at this point to leave the path decided upon in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1410 (2002)</a> last year. We should like further to discuss and analyse the situation and see all alternative avenues explored before we change existing resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">I should like to emphasize, however, that our clear objective remains a stable and democratic Timor-Leste, independent of international assistance. We must therefore keep our strategy under constant review in order to ensure that the success story that is so close will materialize.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Konuzin</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like at the outset to join in the condolences that have been expressed with regard to the death of peacekeepers from the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">We are grateful to Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for the presentation of the special report of the Secretary-General and for the additional information he provided on the latest developments in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">We wish to express our concern over the worsening security situation in that country. The increase in the number and scope of violent incidents represents an alarm signal, and information to the effect that former combatants are forming armed groups, creating bases and setting up clandestine arms caches, with a view to undermining stability, is deserving of immediate and very careful investigation. If such information is confirmed, the military and police components of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), together with the Timor-Leste defence force and police force, will have to take urgent and appropriate measures in order effectively to neutralize the threats that have arisen. We are concerned also that the increased activity on the part of armed groups is possibly being caused by politically motivated elements.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">We agree with the report's conclusion that the high level of unemployment, especially among young people, and the continued and unsolved problem of refugees are key destabilizing factors that are having a negative effect not only on economic development but also on the security situation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">In this connection, we call on the civilian component of UNMISET to do its utmost to assist the Timorese authorities in the implementation of an enlightened social and economic policy aimed at creating employment, eliminating poverty and restoring the infrastructure.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">Of major significance here is also the continuing assistance of the donor community. We hope that, through joint efforts, Indonesia and Timor-Leste, with the support of the United Nations Mission, will in the near future be able to resolve the problem of the remaining 28,000 refugees on Indonesian territory.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">We are prepared carefully to consider the views contained in the report on the reconfiguration and redeployment of UNMISET and on a review of the timetable for downsizing its military component and enhancing its police component. We believe, however, that it could be useful to take another look at whether we have the additional reserves to enhance the effectiveness of the activities of all the component parts of the Mission, with a view to ensuring security and to providing training and assistance to the Timorese law-enforcement structures.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Belinga-Eboutou</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">I, too, would like to thank the Secretary-General for the excellent quality of his special report on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), which has just been submitted to us.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">I should like also to say how much we appreciate the clear and detailed briefing given by Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno as well as his eloquent testimony. I should like also to welcome the presence here this morning of the Permanent Representative of Timor-Leste, Ambassador Guterres. I am pleased that our two countries have decided to establish diplomatic relations, a decision that will be formalized in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">Like previous speakers, I should like to extend the condolences and sympathy of Cameroon to the Republic of Korea for the tragic loss of five of its nationals who were part of the Korean contingent of UNMISET.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">The report of the Secretary-General is a timely one. I should like to state unequivocally that Cameroon agrees, without any reservations, with the recommendations contained in paragraphs 19 to 34 of section III of that report.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste was a protégé of the United Nations; it is a source of pride for the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">We have on several occasions emphasized the fact that security and stability in this young democracy are a prerequisite for its economic and social development. The many challenges faced by the new Timorese authorities - in the areas of education, reconstruction and economic recovery, in the combat against the endemic unemployment affecting the country and in terms of capacity-building - can be met only if internal and external security is ensured and if democratic institutions can successfully overcome any attempt to destabilize them.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">It is obvious today that the former militia still have a great capacity to do harm and that they have in recent months begun to rebuild clandestine networks that have the clear objective of jeopardizing Timorese democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">We welcome the measures advocated by the Secretary-General, especially those aimed at suspending the drawdown of the military component of UNMISET until December 2003, in order to facilitate the massive redeployment of these forces to the border with Indonesia. Similarly, the establishment of an international anti-riot police unit is an extremely wise decision, given the demonstrations that took place in connection with the events of December 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">It is also clear at this stage that the Timor-Leste police force still urgently needs high-level technical assistance. My delegation supports the proposal to raise the number of high-level experts from 100 to 200.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">The strengthening of security cooperation between Indonesia and Timor-Leste is an important aspect of UNMISET strategy. We encourage both countries quickly to finalize the demarcation of their common border. Above all, we support the plan of the Indonesian authorities to move Timorese refugees to other provinces, far from the Timorese border.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">My country appeals to the bilateral and multilateral donors to support this initiative forthwith. The refugee camps are fertile ground for militia, where they go to recruit people whom they exploit to perpetuate insecurity in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">As I have already stressed, the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste is one of the greatest success stories of the Security Council and the United Nations. Let us see to it that this success endures and that Timor-Leste shall live in peace within secure borders and that it may undertake the immense task of reconstruction and development that will allow it to assure economic and social progress for its people.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa13">Lastly, my country wishes to reaffirm its support for UNMISET, Special Representative of the Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma and his entire civilian and military team. In these difficult times, we offer our encouragement to the Timorese authorities, especially President Xanana Gusmão and Prime Minister Marti Alkatiri.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Duclos</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I wish in my turn to thank Mr. Guéhenno for his very comprehensive briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">I also offer our condolences to the Republic of Korea for the loss of five of its peacekeepers attached to the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET).</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">We have considered the Secretary-General's report with keen interest. We agree with him that vigilance is essential. The situation remains precarious, but we must clearly identify the true nature of the threat if we are to respond adequately. Within the country, there is a genuine risk that confrontations, such as those of December 2002, may break out again in Dili or that lesser such incidents may occur in the provinces. As for the external borders, however, we feel that the new State of Timor-Leste is not genuinely threatened. Its relations with Jakarta have been normalized. The militias in West Timor seem to us in general to have demobilized.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">On the basis of this analysis, the best response is undoubtedly to strengthen Timorese peacekeeping capacities. The Secretary-General's recommendations in that context are particularly welcome and we support them fully. As a priority, we should intensify the training of Timorese police. Could the Secretariat give us more information about recruitment and training policies for the Timorese police?</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">As the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany have said, the matter of adjusting the military component of UNMISET is another matter entirely. We have questions about revising the timetable for its downsizing from 2,780 today to 1,750 staff members by the end of the year. The mission of the peacekeepers is not to maintain order; that is a job for the police and, to the extent possible, for the Timorese police. We trust the Commander of UNMISET to redeploy his personnel as effectively as possible from the calmer areas to those where the situation is more sensitive -- in particular, to the limits of the Tactical Coordination Line. This, we feel, should make it possible to protect what has been one of the United Nations greatest successes.</p>

	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">Before I begin my formal statement, I wish to convey our condolences to the Republic of Korea for the loss of five of its peacekeepers and to the bereaved families.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">The Chinese delegation thanks the Secretary-General for his special report and Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Since Timor-Leste achieved its independence, the overall developments there have been encouraging. The Government has conducted nation-building in all its aspects in an orderly manner. On the domestic front, it is trying to achieve broad-based democratic participation; on the diplomatic front, it has actively established and developed friendly relationships and cooperation with all countries of the world, especially those of the region. China is pleased to note that Timor-Leste and Indonesia are seeking to enjoy good-neighbourly relations that will have a positive effect on the long-term stability of the country and the region.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">China expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) for its supportive role. We will continue to support its work.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">In the past few months, however, violence and armed attacks have erupted in Timor-Leste, threatening the national security situation of that young country and raising the concerns of the international community and the Security Council. In his report, the Secretary-General indicates that these incidents and developments are having an alarming effect on the country, which is in the early stages of its political and economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">China expresses its concern over this situation. Security and stability are preconditions for nation-building and development. The ongoing economic and social reconstruction of Timor-Leste, in accordance with the aspirations of the international community, will depend on the creation of long-term stability and a continually improved security environment. In the final analysis, this will depend on the efforts of the people of Timor-Leste themselves. However, as experience in other countries and other regions shows, the international community and the United Nations must provide the necessary assistance in this process if the situation is to be stabilized and if the country is to build its capacity. These are of vital, even indispensable importance.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">Under the Security Council's mandate, UNMISET has played a positive role in helping the authorities of Timor-Leste to undertake capacity-building. After a careful analysis of the Secretary-General's recommendations, China agrees if necessary to reconsider with a flexible attitude the downsizing plans and appropriate adjustments so as to establish the conditions for UNMISET to fulfil its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">The international community has contributed to the independence of Timor-Leste. It has also made commitments to helping that young country pursue its reconstruction and sustainable development. While we are proud of the progress made to date, we should also continue responsibly to honour our commitments to helping Timor-Leste to address the challenges it faces. China has long supported the independence of Timor-Leste and will continue to support its people in their efforts to maintain national stability. We will also continue to provide assistance within our ability to do so.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gaspar Martins</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">Let me start by thanking Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for presenting this report (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>) and saying that I am very pleased that you, Sir, have timely sounded the warning on the changing situation. I would also like to join my colleagues in offering my condolences to the Republic of Korea on the loss we have registered in the peacekeeping force in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">Less than a year ago, the international community celebrated with joy the birth of a new nation. After many years of struggle, the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste was finally born as an independent political entity, with United Nations as its patron, in a demonstration of the power of the international community when it decides to uphold the right of reason against brutal force and inequity. I am pleased to see seated to my right the Permanent Representative of Timor-Leste, my good friend Ambassador Guterrez.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">We all were, and still are, immensely confident in the future of Timor-Leste despite the worrying news that has come recently from that country. In fact, we believe that nobody expected things to proceed without any more problems, or that peace and stability would prevail undisturbed, as it seems is not the case.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">We believe that the international community should continue to assist Timor-Leste with the same commitment and, by doing so, allow the people of Timor-Leste to further consolidate their hard-won freedom and independence. That the international community can continue to cherish Timor-Leste is a great success of its collective will.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">The special report of the Secretary-General on Timor-Leste submitted to the Council gives cause for great concern, given the deteriorating security situation in Timor-Leste. The relative fragility of the security forces and of their ability to restore order is indeed a cause for concern. The activities of the former militias and the credible evidence revealed in the report are indeed disturbing. We believe that the neighbouring countries bear a special responsibility in controlling and curbing such activities, as they might become a source of the most undesirable developments. We urge the Governments of Timor-Leste and Indonesia to promote a good-neighbourly relationship.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">The situation now prevailing will eventually force the Security Council to adjust the downsizing plans that were expected to take place in the near future. However, this must be done with caution and prudence. In this connection, the Angolan delegation fully supports the proposals presented in the report to the Security Council that we are considering. In fact, the recent developments fully justify our choice.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">The proposed adjustment plan contains sensible steps to promote stability and to provide the time required for the Timorese security agencies to become ready to assume their tasks. In fact, the report proposes a revised policing strategy, with the development of a professional police force in Timor-Leste as an essential factor for the consolidation of the democratic State. We are satisfied with the progress achieved so far in building a credible Timorese police force, and we fully understand the concerns behind the proposal: the necessity of further training, the promotion of the force's ability to contain civil disorder in urban areas, and the strengthening of the police's ability to address threats from criminal and armed groups in rural areas and in the region of the Tactical Coordination Line. We deem particularly worrying the situation along the Tactical Coordination Line and the degree of influence that former militia maintain in such a sensitive zone.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">It is my delegation's belief that the United Nations should do its utmost to help Indonesia to resettle as soon as possible the greatest number possible of those former refugees who constitute a dangerous menace to peace and stability in Timor-Leste. Moreover, we believe that the Indonesian authorities should do their utmost to curb anti-Timorese activities in the border region and inside West Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">To conclude, we reiterate our support for the conclusions contained in the report of the Secretary-General. We also deem extremely important the additional commitment of the international community to Timor-Leste in order that the great political and human investment made so far is not lost. We fully support the proposals for the postponement of the downgrading plan until we are assured that the security situation in Timor-Leste can be handled by the Timorese themselves and that its neighbours have a more proactive role in curbing destabilizing activities against the new country. We join the appeal of the Secretary-General for bilateral support to supplement the efforts of UNMISET, including in the vital areas of defence, police and justice.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">Finally, we reiterate our full confidence to the people of Timor-Leste, with the conviction that as they have done in the past, with international help and solidarity they will be able to overcome their difficult moments.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Menéndez</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">At the outset, we express our condolences to the Government and people of the Republic of Korea on the loss of the lives of citizens of their country who served in the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UMMISET).</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">We are thankful for the special report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>) and for the briefing by Mr. Guéhenno on the question of the adjustment of the programme envisaged for downsizing the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">We regret the quantitative and qualitative increase in the violent incidents in recent months. Such actions appear to have various origins, but all underline the importance of creating in Timor-Leste police and armed forces capable of maintaining the country's security and stability and of ensuring respect for the rule of law. It is crucial that the Governments of Indonesia and Timor-Leste cooperate with one another and with UNMISET in all aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">Several issues continue to be fundamental and will contribute to the creation of an environment of greater security. First, agreement on the demarcation of borders should be reached by 30 June. Second is the issue of the repatriation and resettling of the refugees who are currently located in Indonesia. Thirdly, all those responsible for serious crimes need to be brought to trial.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">We believe that the downsizing plan for UNMISET must be readjusted in keeping with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1410 (2002)</a>, as proposed by the Secretary-General, in order to protect security in the short term in an effective manner and to prepare the institutions of Timor-Leste for full responsibility in the future. We therefore support the revised two-phase military strategy proposed by the Secretary-General, which will conclude with the handing over of the responsibility for defence to the Timor-Leste defence force in May 2004. Finally, we also support the revised strategy for police activities, as described by the Secretary-General, to ensure that the handing over of competencies takes place in such as manner as not to endanger stability, while respecting the legitimate wish of the Government of Timor-Leste to take over responsibility for security issues at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Guinea.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">I should like first of all to extend my delegation's sincere condolences to the Government of the Republic of Korea and to the bereaved families for the tragic loss of the five Korean soldiers from the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET).</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">I should like to express my delegation's support for the report of the Secretary-General and to thank Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno for his excellent introduction of the report.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">The birth of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on 20 May 2002 offered us a glimmer of hope for a better future for the people of Timor-Leste, who had for so long been victims of the vicissitudes of history. The many armed incidents and the public unrest in the country since last November have unfortunately tempered our optimism and undermined the hope that had been engendered. The seriousness of those events should urge the Council to consider the steps that can be taken to avoid jeopardizing the valuable achievements of three long years of arduous efforts on the part of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">The anxiety that has taken hold of the people at a time when the country is going through a crucial stage in its political and economic development is extremely disturbing. In this connection, my delegation believes that appropriate investigations should be urgently conducted so as to determine the origins of the climate of instability and to find the right solution. We believe that the very first step should be rapidly to ensure the necessary capacity for maintaining security so as to preserve and strengthen the achievements of the past three years.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1410 (2002)</a>, which the Council adopted unanimously on 17 May 2002, gave UNMISET the specific mandate to ensure, on an interim basis, the implementation of laws and public security; to contribute to the development of the national police force; and to provide assistance for the maintenance of the internal and external security of Timor-Leste. Given the growing threat to the stability and security of the country, that mandate should be supported vigorously now more than ever.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">That is why we fully agree with the recommendations of the Secretary-General, in particular with regard to the simplified two-phase deployment plan for the military component until May 2004 and the strengthening of the operational capacity of the UNMISET police with a view to enabling it to cope with civil disorder and improve the ability of the Timor-Leste police to contain such disorder.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">We agree, however, that we should not exclude the possibility of such plans being revised in the event either of a significant improvement or of a deterioration in the overall security climate. Furthermore, my delegation would like to emphasize the need for the leaders and the people of Timor-Leste fully to promote the implementation of the necessary measures with a view to dealing with that challenge. We also encourage the Indonesian and East Timorese parties to continue negotiations to conclude a final agreement on border demarcation so as to prevent friction in the future and to strengthen relations of trust between the two countries.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">Finally, my delegation would like to reiterate the appeal made to donors for increased support to Timor-Leste in basic areas such as defence, the police, justice and crime reduction. We are convinced that that will help to consolidate the activities of UNMISET and contribute to the establishment, in the near future, of peace and stability, which will be the basis for the sustainable development of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa11">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Timor-Leste, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guterres</span> <span class="nation">Timor-Leste</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">My Government congratulates you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council. We would like to thank you for having convened this open meeting and for having given us the opportunity to speak here today.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Timor-Leste would like to commend the Secretary-General for his timely and comprehensive special report on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>). We thank the Secretary-General for his commitment to ensuring that the intent and goals of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1410 (2002)</a> are fulfilled within the time-frame which it set forth.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">We would like to express our deep gratitude to the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, for the comments that he made this morning. We would also like to express our gratitude for the leadership and advice of Special Representative Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma, as well as to the Deputy Special Representative, who is here with us today. Their work has been invaluable at every level, in particular with regard to the development and strengthening of infrastructures, public administration and law-enforcement capabilities.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">We join other delegations in expressing our profound condolences to the Government and the people of the Republic of Korea for the very recent loss of the young soldiers in Oecussi.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">We note in particular that the Secretary-General's proposals for adjustments to the downsizing schedule do not alter UNMISET's broad concept of operations, its withdrawal date or its ultimate goal of aiding the viability and adequacy of Timor-Leste's security capability.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Timor-Leste reiterates its appreciation for the support, understanding and patience of the Security Council, UNMISET and the donor countries. Because of their aid and support, we have indeed accomplished much in just a few months. We continue to count on their support in all areas, in particular in providing financial and technical support to our defence and police forces.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">It is not necessarily surprising that various pro-militia and anti-Timor-Leste groups from across the border continue to agitate and provoke strife and violence in Timor-Leste. Our independence struggle was difficult and lasted for decades. Some former militia, unhappy with independence, democracy and freedom, whether in Indonesia or in Timor-Leste, have not given up. Their terrorist attacks in the border area in January and February of this year reflect a coordinated plan to destabilize Timor-Leste and to destroy a nation created with the help of the Security Council and the international community. Only yesterday, the Timorese people in the Atabae region captured another former militia member armed with an SKS rifle. Nevertheless, the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste remains absolutely confident that such terrorism and outside criminal interference will not prevail. The Council of Ministers is currently in the process of considering counter-terrorism conventions, which will help us comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">The Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>) takes note of the significant progress being made in bilateral relations between Timor-Leste and Indonesia. Strengthening relations with our neighbours remains a top priority. We are grateful for the continued cooperation and good will of the Government of Indonesia. We expect to remain on track with our border negotiations and on addressing refugee and other issues. Relations with Indonesia today are fraternal and excellent.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">A few weeks ago, the Serious Crimes Unit, created during the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor indicted some key Indonesian former military leaders. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, President Xanana Gusmão and Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri sent a high-level delegation led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Mr. Ramos-Horta, to convey to the Indonesian authorities the concerns and the official position of Timor-Leste. As in any democratic country, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed in Timor-Leste. While respecting the decision of the judiciary in Timor-Leste, the Government is also seeking, with the Indonesian Government, better ways to attain justice and truth. We reiterate our firm conviction that reconciliation and healing will positively impact relations between Timor-Leste and Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">Timor-Leste is also continuing its good relations with Australia. The difficult negotiations on petroleum and gas development in the Timor Sea are nearing a successful outcome. More globally, Timor-Leste continues to develop good relations with all nations. We are indeed honoured to be a member of the community of nations. We became a member of the Non-Aligned Movement last month at Kuala Lumpur.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">Internally, Timor-Leste is working hard to develop and establish the legislation, laws and democratic institutions necessary to ensure justice and security. We are only a few months old. We do need more trained judges, lawyers, corrections personnel and facilities, as well as professional police and military personnel. However, we remain confident that the drive, democratic commitment and will of the Timorese people will keep us moving forward in that regard. Moreover, we know that we can count on the continued help of the international community in achieving those goals, both bilaterally and through the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">Timor-Leste appreciates the wisdom shown by Security Council members in having <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1410 (2002)</a> provide for a constant reassessment of security needs and for a scheduled downsizing. The Secretary-General is continuing to re-assess the implementation of UNMISET's downsizing process to ensure that it realistically relates to the situation at hand. In particular, we believe that the adjustments in downsizing will maximize the effectiveness of UNMISET in helping Timor-Leste to face very serious ongoing security threats. The Government of Timor-Leste wholeheartedly endorses and supports the re-assessment, recommendations and proposals contained in the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa13">The Government of Timor-Leste is consciously working, within its own resource constraints, towards the objective of providing a secure and stable environment for the future development and stability of the country. The contribution of UNMISET towards that process is significant and must continue at the required levels while Timorese security forces develop to their fullest capacities.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa14">Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri recently discussed the contents of the special report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council with Special Representative Kamalesh Sharma and expressed his full support for the proposals contained therein. The Prime Minister highlighted in particular the crucial importance of the proposals related to the strengthening of police capacity through enhanced training and the provision of additional equipment. He thanked the Secretary-General for the proposal to deploy an international formed unit to provide the time required for those actions to bear fruit. The Prime Minister also fully supported the proposal for a pause in the draw-down of UNMISET's military component and for the enhancement of its capacities to undertake operations against incidents of the type observed in Ermera and, recently, in Atabae.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa15">The proposals put forward in the Secretary-General's report represent a proportionate, considered and well-balanced response to emerging perils threatening to destabilize the security situation in the country. Those threats could jeopardize the significant investments made in the past by the international community and the Timorese Government.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa16">The Prime Minister has also promised to find, with the help of donor countries, the budgetary support required for the accelerated development of the national police force through the recruitment and training of 500 additional police officers who, upon completion of training, would be the points of contact with armed groups. Obviously, those officers would need to be equipped in a manner that would enable them to effectively counter the nature and range of weapons of the type used by armed groups. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste will take the necessary actions in that regard at the appropriate time.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa17">On the one hand, there is the clear requirement to ensure that the draw-down in UNMISET's military component and the lack of required capacities in the police do not lead to a premature testing of capabilities by armed groups. At the same time, it is also of the utmost importance that Timor-Leste be adequately equipped for and protected against the strong possibility that the security preparedness of the nascent State will be tested by armed forces after the departure of UNMISET. The present proposals contained in Secretary-General's special report, along with the actions that will be undertaken by the Government of Timor-Leste, provide for both requirements in a balanced manner.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa18">I would like to conclude by respectfully requesting the support of all Security Council members for the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's special report. We would like once again to reiterate our firm commitment to the promotion of sustainable development, stability, security, the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Timor-Leste for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Santa Clara Gomes</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">First of all, allow me to express my condolences to the Government and people of the Republic of Korea over the tragic death of five soldiers in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">Thank you for convening this open meeting of the Security Council to examine the quarterly special report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-243.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/243</a>). The report allows Member States to follow recent developments closely and to remain informed of progress in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1410 (2002)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">Thus far, Timor-Leste has been a success story for the United Nations and for the international community. In the past three years, we have witnessed a dramatic change in the country, and the devastation produced by conflict has given way to peace, to institution-building and to the laying of the foundations for future prosperity. Timor-Leste is now a proud member of the United Nations, after having benefited from its support for nation-building.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">It was never envisioned that that support would be of unlimited duration. On the contrary, it was intended from the beginning that the United Nations would perform within a reasonable time frame the tasks that it assumed in the country. We are glad that the Secretary-General, in his report, considers that the mission can be completed within the period of time envisaged. It is a welcome confirmation that, despite all of the unforeseen circumstances -- which no amount of planning can ever completely cover -- the considerable international effort deployed so far is producing the expected results.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">But this encouraging conclusion of the Secretary-General, based on a careful examination of the country's evolution, should lead us to pay attention to all of his recommendations. However successful its story, Timor-Leste is still fragile, and unfortunately we see a sharp increase in the frequency and the magnitude of security-related incidents, some of them of a terrorist nature. That was not originally foreseen, and the proposed downsizing planned for UNMISET did not take such developments into account. Keeping the envisioned handover date of May 2004 in place, the Secretary-General now proposes a reconfiguration of the military component and adoption of a revised phased approach to prepare the new country to better face existing threats. He also proposes enhancement of the operational capability of the international police component. These are short-term measures to promote security and, simultaneously, to increase the effectiveness and speed of the training of the Timorese police.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">As a country that is a major troop contributor to UNMISET, we support these recommendations, which seem entirely reasonable to us in the light of a changed situation. We also support them because they aim at preventing any backward movement away from a positive trend of which we are proud and in the conviction that, if we were to lose momentum, it would be costly for the country and for the United Nations to restore the situation. Finally, we must note that the additional financial resources required are quite modest compared with the large-scale investment that we have all made over the past few years.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">As in the past, Portugal will remain committed to the consolidation and development of Timor-Leste and to United Nations efforts towards that end. I am confident that the Security Council will not hesitate, in this final stage, to ensure through its decisions a happy end for this story, which has been one of success so far.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dauth</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">First of all, as this is the first time I have met with the Security Council this month, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council in this difficult month. It is a good thing for all of us that the presidency is in such steady and reliable hands. In addition, I should like to express the condolences of my delegation and of Australia to the Republic of Korea with regard to the sad losses that it has sustained in East Timor in recent days.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">Thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open meeting on an issue of fundamental interest to my country. I want also to thank my friend Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his briefing today on the current security situation and on the proposals for a freeze in the peacekeeping force of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET).</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">In addition, let me express my gratitude for the kind references made in today's debate to the recently concluded negotiations between my Government and the Government of Timor-Leste to open the way for development of the valuable petroleum resources in the Timor Sea. As Council members are aware, under the provisions of the Timor Sea Treaty, Timor-Leste will receive 90 per cent of Government revenues from the Joint Petroleum Development Area. That, of course, will be a crucial element in promoting the long-term stability and prosperity of Timor-Leste, to which -- needless to say -- my country is deeply committed.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">We are, however, seriously concerned by the recent security incidents in Timor-Leste. They indicate that Timor-Leste's transition to self-reliant statehood remains a difficult path that requires the continued attention and support of the United Nations and of interested States. It is our assessment that these incidents have been driven primarily by criminal motivations and by internal political, economic and social factors. Some incidents have involved individuals and groups taking advantage of spontaneous events for their own purposes. Some have had a political motivation and have involved the use of violence for political purposes. Others are likely to have involved the settlement of old scores. Poor law-enforcement capacity has allowed some incidents to spin out of control.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">These are all issues for law enforcement, both preventive and investigative. We have no concrete evidence of an external direction in the commission of recent incidents, although indications are that some of the individuals involved were West-Timor-based ex-militia members. We note that senior members of the Government of Timor-Leste have rejected the notion of an external direction in these incidents. Australia is strongly of the view that the United Nations police (UNPOL) and the Timor-Leste police service -- not the peacekeeping force -- should be the primary actors in responding to internal security matters.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">It is in that context that Australia does not consider that recent internal security developments in Timor-Leste warrant a freeze in peacekeeping force numbers at this time. We are concerned that a freeze would not address, and might deflect attention from, the more urgent issue of developing Timor-Leste's law-enforcement capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">It is imperative that UNMISET address the shortfall in Timor-Leste's policing capabilities and UNPOL weaknesses. The recent security incidents make clear that law enforcement will be a continuing challenge for Timor-Leste, including beyond the period of UNMISET's mandate. We would therefore support a temporary freeze in UNPOL numbers and an amended schedule for the handover of policing authority from the United Nations to Timor-Leste. That would allow a major reorientation of UNPOL's approach and a redirection of resources to focus seriously and systematically on capacity-building within the Timor-Leste police service.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">We also consider that the final report of the joint assessment mission on policing, which was released publicly last week, provides the framework for a renewed United Nations-led effort in police development. Australia is willing to make a strong contribution to these efforts, and we encourage other interested countries to do likewise.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">While Australia does not support a freeze in the peacekeeping force drawdown, we accept that security is an ongoing challenge. We would not wish the international community to unintentionally signal to elements within Timor-Leste that our focus on and commitment to security in Timor-Leste are wavering.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">Australia therefore supports a slower drawdown of the peacekeeping force than envisaged to ensure that the international community's commitment to Timor-Leste's security is well understood. We would welcome a further United Nations proposal on a less sharp adjustment to the phasing and numbers of the peacekeeping force drawdown. However, we reiterate that this approach will work only if it is accompanied by a vigorous and sustained effort to address the shortfalls in Timor-Leste's policing capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">Australia recognizes the importance of ensuring that the significant achievements made by the United Nations in Timor-Leste are not undermined by a deterioration in the security situation. At the same time, we are concerned to ensure that UNMISET and interested countries implement appropriate responses to address these current problems. Australia, for its part, remains committed to assisting the United Nations and the Timor-Leste Government in responding effectively to the current challenges, in order to ensure Timor Leste's transition to a secure and self-reliant statehood.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Australia for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Indonesia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Percaya</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">Since this is the first time that my delegation has taken the floor this month, let me begin, Sir, by congratulating you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for March 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">Let me also convey my Government's condolences to the Government of the Republic of Korea for the tragic loss of five members of the peacekeeping force in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">My delegation takes note of the Secretary-General's report describing the recent changes taking place in, and the challenges faced by, the Government and the people of Timor-Leste, particularly with regard to security-related issues.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">However, permit me first to underline the significant improvements in our bilateral relations with Timor-Leste since last year. The convening of a trilateral meeting between Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Australia, as well as the first Ministerial Meeting of the Southwest Pacific Dialogue, have already laid the foundations of a cooperative framework which promises to strengthen and build our relationship. Since the first meeting of the Joint Ministerial Commission for Bilateral Cooperation, in October 2002, several follow-up technical meetings and contacts, including both official and private-sector visits, have greatly served to boost our relationship on the basis of reconciliation, mutual respect and a forward-looking stance.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">In addition, we see the opening of the Embassy of Timor-Leste in Jakarta as a concrete step towards further facilitating consultations and cooperation between our two countries. This initiative should go a long way towards promoting, on a lasting basis, our existing friendly relations and our ongoing mutual cooperation. For its part, Indonesia will reciprocate this positive development in the very near future. As a result, I would like to underline the fact that the relationship between Indonesia and Timor-Leste has indeed been flourishing at all levels. I therefore firmly believe that this deserves the strong support of the Council and of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">My Government would like to express its deep concern and sympathy to the Government and the people of Timor-Leste concerning the security incidents that have occurred over the past few months. Indeed, it is our view that we should deal with them in a meticulous and vigilant manner. It is also of critical importance that we seek to avoid any terminology or references that do not fully reflect the situation on the ground and that we not reach any conclusions based on such sketchy foundations. Indeed, such an approach serves only to aggravate the situation and could eventually play into the hands of certain groups or parties that want to take advantage of it. That does not work towards the greater good of both countries and our growing relationship, which is based on mutual respect and a progressive outlook.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">I can assure the Council that the reconciliation process that has been propelling our positive bilateral relations over the past year is an ongoing one. Therefore, we are disappointed to note that the report of the Secretary-General still refers to the involvement of "supported militias" in the incidents that occurred in Timor-Leste. Indeed, the blame should go to UNMISET for its deliberate ignorance in the way that it seeks to protect the people from criminal elements.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that these unfortunate incidents should not be allowed to disrupt the growing and promising relationships between Timor-Leste and its neighbouring countries. Indonesia continues to support the building of a strong, united and democratic Timor-Leste.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Indonesia for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haraguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, I would like to thank you for convening this meeting on the situation in Timor-Leste. I would like also to thank Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno for his introduction of the special report of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">Let me join previous speakers in expressing my sincere condolences to the families of the five peacekeepers from the Republic of Korea who lost their precious lives last week in the course of their service to the cause of peace in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">I will focus my statement today on the question of the adjustment to the downsizing plan for the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). Up to now, international involvement in Timor-Leste has been a success story. A great deal of effort has been expended, and much has been achieved in keeping the peace and building the nation. It is important that we continue to make steady efforts towards the successful completion of UNMISET's mandate by June of next year, as scheduled.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">The Government of Japan is concerned, however, as is the Secretary-General, over some changes we have come to witness in the internal security situation in Timor-Leste since November and December last. We also recognize the need, in general, to adjust the configuration of the peacekeeping mission to changes in the security environment, both for the successful achievement of its mandate and for the safety and security of the peacekeepers.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">As for the observations and proposals contained in the special report of the Secretary-General, my Government shares his assessment that the Timorese police force still lacks the capacity to cope effectively with civil disturbances or incidents by armed groups of such magnitude as recently erupted in Timor-Leste. We therefore consider it desirable to take special measures in the police sector, and we support the proposals for enhancing the international civilian police presence and for increasing assistance to the Timorese police force.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">On the other hand, there are apparently different views among the Governments concerned on the proposed measures relating to the military component of UNMISET. Such differences seem to arise from the disparate assessments of the recent incidents and the security situation in the border area, as well as the possible roles that the Timorese defence force may play. If the downsizing plan is to be modified as proposed, troop-contributing countries will have to adjust their deployment schedule. This will not be an easy task, and it will require a considerable amount of time and effort on their part. Should the international involvement in the field be prolonged longer than necessary, it would not only be undesirable for the international community, but could also impede the self-reliance of Timor-Leste. My Government hopes that an early decision which takes these factors into consideration will be made in a manner acceptable to all concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">My Government fully supports the recommendation that UNMISET should promote better relations with the people of Timor-Leste and greater public information capabilities in order to enhance understanding of the military component's role and to counter potential misinformation campaigns. In this context, I wish to note that the Japanese engineering unit has endeavoured to establish good relations with the Timorese people through various civil assistance efforts, public information events and training for the local population. We will continue such efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">Lastly, I would like to stress that, as the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out, lasting stability depends on the strong political commitment of the Timor-Leste leadership to the rule of law and on its continuing efforts to strengthen governance. So long as the leaders of Timor-Leste make such earnest efforts on their own, it is incumbent upon the international community to continue to assist them. The Government of Japan, for its part, is determined to continue to extend as much assistance as it can to the consolidation of peace in Timor-Leste.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I shall now give the floor to Mr. Guéhenno to respond to comments and questions raised.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guéhenno</span> <span class="non-nation">Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">I will first answer two specific questions that were put to me by the Ambassador of Chile and the representative of Mexico.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">The Ambassador of Chile asked about the national development plan. I would say that this plan continues to provide the road map for Timor-Leste's development and for support by development partners. Every month, there is a meeting chaired by the Vice-Minister of Finance with the development partners to monitor the progress of the implementation. Apart from those monthly meetings, there are specific special meetings that take place to look at the strategy. Most recently, the Government met with development partners in Dili in December. That meeting focused on and supported a number of programmes that support stability in the long and short terms.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">These programmes include reconstruction plans, with an emphasis on the employment of ex-combatants and of unemployed youth. Further national capacity-building programmes will focus on justice, on police and on public administration. The next major meeting of development partners should take place in June. I would stress that, over the past three years, $580 million have been provided by development partners for the development of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">At the same time, it has also to be noted that Timor-Leste remains one of the least developed countries, with less than $500 per capita income per year. We very much hope that the development of mineral resources -- about which we had good new this morning -- will open a new era. In the meantime, continued support by Member States remains essential to the stabilization and development of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">The representative of Mexico asked about the situation of terrorism with respect to Timor-Leste. The United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) is working with the Government of Timor-Leste and with the relevant specialized branch of the United Nations to assist the Government in strengthening its ability to address terrorism. At the same time, I have to stress that further assistance from Member States will be essential, including in the sharing of information and in developing training capacities. As we all know, in the matter of terrorism, intelligence gathering is of critical importance and Timor-Leste needs the support of the international community in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">As for the situation today of the international terrorist threat with respect to Timor-Leste, while we do remain concerned about the risk of terrorism, we have not seen evidence that suggests imminent specific threats, although a considerable level of heightened alert is being maintained, particularly in Dili. We think that, for the future, what is important, again, is that any relevant information be immediately shared with the Timorese authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">Let me now turn to the questions and remarks raised by several delegations, both on the analysis of the situation and on the recommendations we are making.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">Of course, we did not ignore the good news. This morning, I referred to the conclusion of the agreements between Australia and Timor-Leste. I could also have reiterated what the report says on the good relations that have developed between Timor-Leste and Indonesia and which were confirmed by the representatives of the two countries. This is indeed a very important element that can help in the future, including in addressing potential threats.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">Nevertheless, we feel it is our duty to look at all aspects, including the bad news. Nobody likes to revise their own plans, and if the Secretary-General decided to put the report before the Council it is because we felt that it was indeed necessary to put all the facts before the Council. I think the first consideration for us -- and I would like to stress this -- is to close a window of vulnerability while the Mission draws down and Timor-Leste builds up. This is not an open-ended commitment; this is not an open-ended freeze. It would be the closure of a window of vulnerability that we see opening with changed security circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">The point was made that the issue is more of a police issue than a military issue. In our view, actually, there are two distinct threats. There is, indeed, a problem that has to be dealt with by police means. Nobody challenges the need -- and I will come back to this in a minute -- to strengthen our efforts to build the capacity of the Timorese police. At the same time, when, in the follow-up to the latest incidents, our troops found 1,000 rounds of ammunition in the midst of the jungle at an abandoned camp site, we do not see that as a police operation. We see that as definitely of a military nature. Our concern is that the two threats can combine and our duty is always to provide for the worst-case scenario. The two threats can be mutually reinforcing and we see our efforts with respect to the police, on the one side, and the military on the other as not exclusive, but also mutually reinforcing.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa11">We have been asked for more details on what we plan for the police. I think, on that, we will be prepared, if the Council so wishes, to have another meeting of police-contributing countries to brief them in detail and to answer any questions that they might have on what we plan for the police. Let me just say in this Chamber that what we are doing at the moment is less ambitious, although we believe quite professional, than what has been done in other missions -- for instance, in the Balkans. At the moment, the Timorese police get three months in the police academy, three months of in-service training and then six months of thematic training. One of the modules is crowd management and control. We get some bilateral support in those various activities. In that respect, I would like to mention the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Programme (ICITAP), the United States bilateral initiative that assists very actively in all modular training initiatives. All that is important, necessary and useful. We are not sure that at this stage it has really built the capacity in a way that allows the Timorese to deal with the range of contingencies with which they may be confronted.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa12">To conclude, I would just like to note that the figures that are being discussed should be compared to what is being done in other theatres of operation. When I think that the present military force in Timor-Leste is approximately one sixth of the force that NATO deems prudent to keep in Kosovo, I think that the adjustments that we are suggesting reflect just a prudent approach to a situation where some elements remain murky. The size and nature of the threat will require further, continued review. Nevertheless, we believe that is our duty to always plan for the worst case and that the recent developments in Timor do warrant the adjustments that we have put before the Council.</p>
