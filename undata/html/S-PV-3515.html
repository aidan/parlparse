	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Tajikistan in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the following documents: <a href="../pdf/S-1995-225.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/225</a>, letter dated 27 March 1995 from the Permanent Representative of Tajikistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General; and <a href="../pdf/S-1995-283.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/283</a>, letter dated 10 April 1995 from the Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the escalation of military activities on the Tajik-Afghan border which resulted in grave loss of life. In this context, the Council reminds the parties of their obligations to ensure the safety of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy and all other United Nations personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Council strongly believes that armed activities by the Tajik opposition in violation of the cease-fire Agreement of 17 September 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1102.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1102</a>, Annex I) jeopardize the inter-Tajik dialogue and the process of national reconciliation as a whole. Noting also recent violations of the 17 September 1994 Agreement by Government forces, the Council calls on the Tajik opposition and the Government of Tajikistan to comply strictly with the obligations they have assumed under that Agreement and calls on the Tajik opposition in particular to extend it for a substantial period beyond 26 April 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Council fully supports the appeal of the Secretary-General to the Tajik parties and other countries concerned to exercise restraint, to do their utmost to continue the political dialogue and to hold the next round of talks as soon as possible. It welcomes the agreement by the Government of Tajikistan and the Tajik opposition to the proposal of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy to hold an urgent high-level meeting of their representatives in Moscow. It calls upon the countries of the region to discourage any activities that could complicate or hinder the peace process in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"Reaffirming its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-968(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 968 (1994)</a> of 16 December 1994, the Council once again urges the parties to reconfirm through concrete steps their commitment to resolve the conflict only through political means. The Council reiterates its call on the parties to hold the fourth round of the inter-Tajik talks without delay on the basis as agreed during the previous rounds of consultations."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-16.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/16</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
