Throughout both times of relative stability and times of change and crisis on the ground, the knowledge and insights Mr. Guéhenno has shared with the members of the Council have been invaluable. For that we are immensely grateful. In saying farewell to him, we wish Mr. Guéhenno all the best for his professional and personal well-being.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest possible terms the attack on 8 July 2008 on an African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) military and police convoy in Um Hakibah by 200 fighters on horses and in 40 vehicles, using sophisticated weaponry and tactics, which resulted in the deaths of 7 peacekeepers and a further 22 United Nations/African Union personnel being wounded. This unacceptable act of extreme violence is the largest attack on UNAMID since the transfer of authority from the African Union Mission in Sudan on 31 December 2007. The Council is particularly concerned that the attack was premeditated, deliberate and intended to inflict casualties.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the United Nations investigation under way and the Government of the Sudan's statement to assist the United Nations investigation. It calls on the Government of the Sudan to do its utmost to ensure that the perpetrators of the attack are swiftly identified and brought to justice. The Council underlines its determination to take action against those responsible after hearing the outcome of UNAMID's investigation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its condolences to the Governments of Rwanda, Ghana and Uganda for the deaths of their peacekeepers and to the victims' families. It commends the dedication of UNAMID personnel. The Council stresses that any attack or threat against UNAMID is unacceptable, and demands that there be no reoccurrence. It underlines that attacks on United Nations peacekeepers during an armed conflict can constitute war crimes under applicable international law and calls upon all parties to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council calls on all parties to agree to a cessation of hostilities, to engage fully and constructively in the political process under the leadership of the new United Nations/African Union joint Chief Mediator, Mr. Djibrill Yipènè Bassole, and to cooperate fully with the deployment of UNAMID and respect its security and freedom of movement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council further calls on the United Nations and all parties to facilitate the rapid and complete deployment of UNAMID and on capable Member States to contribute the helicopter and transportation units necessary to ensure the successful implementation of UNAMID's mandate."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-27.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/27</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
