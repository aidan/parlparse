<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on Haiti, <a href="../pdf/S-2004-698.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2004/698</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council extends its appreciation to participating countries of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), and hopes that those countries that have pledged to contribute troops and civilian police will do their utmost to expedite the early deployment of their personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council notes that, while the overall situation in Haiti has improved since last February, challenges by illegal armed groups to the authority of the Transitional Government are undermining stability and security in some parts of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council condemns attempts by some illegal armed groups to perform unauthorized law enforcement functions in some Haitian cities. The Council underscores the need for the Transitional Government to extend its control and authority throughout the country. It stresses the need that MINUSTAH actively assist the Transitional Government's security institutions in addressing the activities of all illegal armed groups in accordance with the mandate provided in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1542(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1542 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council stresses the urgency of disbanding and disarming all illegal armed groups. It calls upon the Transitional Government to complete without delay the establishment of the required structures and the adoption of the required legal framework for the implementation of a national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. It notes that MINUSTAH will assist the Transitional Government in these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council underlines that stability and security remain key to the political and economic reconstruction efforts of the Transitional Government and the international community. It stresses the importance of building the capacity of an effective and professional national police in Haiti. It reiterates the importance of effective coordination and cooperation between MINUSTAH and the Haitian National Police. It also underlines the urgency of improving the situation of human rights in the country, including women's rights.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council underlines that only a comprehensive and inclusive dialogue in Haiti can lay down the foundations of a peaceful and democratic political environment. It calls upon all Haitian political actors to participate in the national dialogue, as well as in the transition and in the electoral process to occur in 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council welcomes that the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) has marked the start of the electoral process in Haiti by holding a broad dialogue on the preparation of elections. The Council encourages the United Nations and the Organization of American States to finalize a Memorandum of Understanding outlining election responsibilities of each organization as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council reiterates that an end to impunity is key to national reconciliation in Haiti. The Council stresses that justice should apply equally to all citizens in that country and be carried out by an independent judicial system with the support of a reformed correctional system. The Council expresses its strong concern at reports of double standards in the administration of justice. The Council welcomes the intention expressed by the Transitional Government to cease travel restrictions without judicial justification in place against former civil servants and politicians. It urges the Transitional Government to end such restrictions without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council welcomes the results of the donors' conference held in Washington, D.C., on 19 and 20 July and urges for a timely disbursement of the funds pledged. The Council looks forward to the follow-up implementation meeting to be held in Port-au-Prince from 22 to 23 September, taking into account the priorities identified by the Haitian Government's Interim Cooperation Framework.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council reiterates its support for the establishment of a Core Group to maintain the mobilization of the international community, to increase the consultation among major stakeholders to enhance the coordination and effectiveness of the assistance for Haiti, and to contribute to the definition of a long-term development strategy aimed at the promotion of lasting peace and stability in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council welcomes the appointment of Mr. Juan Gabriel Valdés as Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of MINUSTAH and commits its full support to his work."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-32.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/32</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
