	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council expresses deep concern over the looting and burning of houses by the HVO forces in the area of Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo, which have continued for some time, and it also notes with concern that similar acts have been committed by Bosnian Serb forces in other areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council is also deeply concerned by reports that the HVO is moving mine laying equipment into the Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo areas.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council considers that such actions are dangerous and detrimental to the spirit of confidence essential for the implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-999.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/999</a>, annex).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council demands that all such actions be stopped immediately and stresses the need for all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to demonstrate the cooperation essential for the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-60.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/60</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
