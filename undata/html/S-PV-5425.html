	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of members to <a href="../pdf/S-2006-256.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2006/256</a>, which contains a letter dated 13 April 2006 from the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council transmitting a letter of the same date from the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and African Integration of Chad.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's briefing on 18 April 2006 on Chad/Sudan relations and endorses his deep concerns over the political and security situation and the instability along Chad's borders with the Sudan, as well as over the possible spillover effects of these crises on neighbouring countries and the entire region. The Security Council encourages the Secretary-General to continue his consultations with relevant parties, in particular the African Union, on the matter and requests him to closely follow the situation and continue to keep the Security Council informed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the fact-finding mission dispatched by the African Union in Chad and looks forward to its conclusions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council fully endorses the statement by the African Union Peace and Security Council of 13 April 2006 in which it strongly condemned the rebel attacks against N'Djamena and the eastern town of Adre and reiterates that any attempt to seize power by force, pursuant to the 1999 Algiers Declaration of the Organization of African Unity, would be regarded as unacceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council calls for political dialogue and a negotiated solution to the continuing crisis within Chad.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council also reaffirms the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Chad and of the Sudan, as well as of all States in the region, and calls on all Members to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council calls upon on States in the region to cooperate in ensuring their common stability.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council notes with deep concern the deteriorating relations between Chad and the Sudan and urges the Governments of the two countries to abide by their obligations under the 8 February 2006 Tripoli Agreement and to urgently start implementing the confidence-building measures which have been voluntarily agreed upon. Both the Sudan and Chad must refrain from any actions that violate the border.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council is concerned about the situation of the refugees from the Darfur region of the Sudan and from the Central African Republic, as well as the situation of the thousands of internally displaced persons in Chad. It therefore notes the decision by the Government of Chad not to expel the Sudanese refugees and urges the Government of Chad to continue supporting the efforts of humanitarian and relief agencies in the country in accordance with international principles governing the protection of refugees. The Security Council further reaffirms the right of all displaced persons who wish to do so to return to their homes. It reminds all Governments in the region of their obligation to respect international humanitarian law. In this regard, the Security Council calls on donor countries to provide additional resources to respond to the emergency humanitarian situation in both the Sudan and Chad."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-19.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/19</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
