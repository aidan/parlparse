	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union; the candidate countries of Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey; the countries of the stabilization and association process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries Iceland and Norway, members of the European Economic area, align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa02">We wish to highlight the importance of the Capital Master Plan to the European Union and our intense disappointment that it proved impossible for the Fifth Committee to agree on a resolution at this session. Nevertheless, we feel that the preparatory work for the draft resolution that we have undertaken has been essentially meaningful. We have had a good dialogue, and the motivations and objectives of delegations and groups have been discussed on this vital issue. We regret that the key elements of our proposal did not get the approval of the host country. We obviously will come back to all these issues in the fifty-ninth session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa03">At the plenary meeting of the Fifth Committee earlier this month, I made a statement on behalf of my group regarding the Capital Master Plan. In that statement, we have set out the clear messages we wanted to include in the draft resolution, including the responsibility of the host country and the need for more financing and construction options for the Capital Master Plan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa04">The European Union believes that the provisional offer of an interest-bearing loan does not meet our expectations of the host country responsibility and requests the Secretary-General to study all options, including a more substantial offer from the United States, that would allow us to proceed with the Capital Master Plan in the most cost-effective manner. The European Union continues to be firmly committed to the capital master plan and we are ready to cooperate, both with the Secretariat and with delegations to take a decision on United Nations DC-5 in the fall.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Stoffer" nation="United States" language="">
	Mr. Stoffer (United States)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa01">My delegation wishes to clarify a few points with respect to the Capital Master Plan and the provisional United States financing offer.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa02">We fully agree with all those voices urging that the Capital Master Plan move forward as quickly as possible so that we can respond to the safety and security deficiencies of the United Nations Headquarters complex and make sure that they are addressed as quickly as possible. We need to keep the Master Plan project on track. In February of this year, the President of the United States of America submitted his fiscal year 2005 budget to the United States Congress for approval, including an offer to finance the entire $1.2 billion estimated cost of the Capital Master Plan. During our negotiations on the Capital Master Plan in 2002, the United States never put forward any specific financing mechanism, certainly not an interest-free loan offer, since we could not know at that time what the President would include in his fiscal year 2005 budget presentation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa03">The United States financial commitment to the United Nations was first demonstrated in the 1940s by providing an interest-free loan for the construction of the present Headquarters complex. The Rockefeller family donated the land on which the United Nations now stands. We are now at the beginning of the twenty-first century and the United States is prepared to make a strong commitment once again. This time our resources will be contributed for the renovation, reconstruction and modernization of the 60-year-old Headquarters of the most important international Organization in the world. The federal level of the United States Government is offering an interest-bearing loan to cover the full cost of the project. We will pay our share of principal plus interest. We believe our proposed interest rates are advantageous and will remain so over the next 30 years. Member States will need to consider how best to repay the loan over as many as 30 years, or less, as Member States decide. The interest rates will vary directly with the length of the loan repayment, with the lowest rate available for the shortest repayment period. It is a fair and reasonable offer.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa04">The United States donates well over $1 billion a year to the United Nations in voluntary contributions, in addition to its assessed contributions. We made our financial offer for the Capital Master Plan so that the project can move forward expeditiously. If other financing offers were made available, we would welcome their introduction and consideration in tandem with, or in lieu of, our offer.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa05">I want to add one final point that often gets overlooked in our discussions of the Capital Master Plan. The city and state of New York have made related offers to construct a new 37-story building at 42nd Street and First Avenue, which will be used as swing space during the renovation phase of the Capital Master Plan. Subsequently, that building will serve as a new addition to the United Nations Headquarters complex, to consolidate the many United Nations operations now located in commercial rental spaces in the vicinity of the United Nations. Over 25 years, the United Nations will pay rents at rates well below the market value for such office space. After that period, the United Nations will not only receive the keys to the building but be given the use of the land on which it stands in perpetuity. The federal, state and city offers represent a package of financial commitments to the United Nations that, taken together, are a substantial demonstration of America's support for the United Nations and its continued presence in New York in a modern, safe and secure Headquarters.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa06">We will welcome a constructive and informed discussion of this issue during the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. While we did not have time during the current session to conduct a detailed and creative review of all the steps that will be needed to bring the vision of the Capital Master Plan to fruition, we look forward to that discussion in the autumn.</div>
