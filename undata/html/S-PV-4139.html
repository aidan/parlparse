<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">First of all, let me welcome the Secretary-General, who has joined us for our discussion on the situation in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">The Security Council is meeting in response to the requests contained in the letter dated 10 May 2000 from the Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of Eritrea, and in the letters dated 11 May 2000 from the Chargés d'affaires ad interim of Mali and Namibia, documents <a href="../pdf/S-2000-408.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/408</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-2000-409.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/409</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2000-410.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/410</a>, respectively.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">I would like to emphasize the urgency and importance of the matter before the Council. Since the deterioration of the situation in Sierra Leone, the Security Council has heard regular briefings from the Secretariat and had a number of very useful consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">I call on the Secretary-General.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I commend the Council, and other Member States represented here, for the sense of urgency they are showing in dealing with this grave crisis in Sierra Leone. This is entirely appropriate, given the very serious challenge which that situation now presents to all of us in the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">As of this moment, several hundred United Nations peacekeepers -- the great majority of them Zambians -- are still being detained against their will in various parts of Sierra Leone. These are soldiers who came to Sierra Leone not as enemies but as friends and peacemakers, under the terms of an agreement negotiated and signed by both parties, including Corporal Foday Sankoh on behalf of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). The United Nations peacekeeping mission was asked, under the agreement, to manage the disarmament process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">It is deplorable and unacceptable that the same RUF should now not only interfere with the disarmament process but arbitrarily detain members of the United Nations mission. Once again I would remind Mr. Sankoh that he is responsible for the action of forces under his command. He will be held accountable for their actions, and for the safety and well-being of all those who have been detained.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">I demand the immediate and unconditional release of all United Nations personnel, and I thank all those, in particular the leaders of neighbouring countries, who are working to secure that outcome. I am glad to confirm that two United Nations military personnel were released earlier today.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">But it must go without saying that our concern is not limited to the safety of United Nations peacekeepers. It must embrace the plight of all those they are there to help, namely, the people of Sierra Leone, now threatened with yet another round of fighting and inevitably fearful that the atrocities of past years will be renewed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">It is vital that the world should not now abandon the people of Sierra Leone in their hour of greatest need. They are entitled to expect not only humanitarian assistance -- which United Nations agencies are continuing to provide -- but also some protection.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">Let me remind the Council that our mission was configured as a peacekeeping force. It was neither designed nor equipped to be an enforcement operation. And it was attacked by one of the parties that had pledged to cooperate with it, before it had been properly deployed. Given that new situation, we have to consolidate and reinforce our troops so that they can defend themselves and their mandates effectively, and so that they can help stabilize the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">I am glad to say that additional troops are on their way, including units with battle experience and with combat equipment, such as artillery and helicopter gunships. I thank the troop-contributing countries for making these units and equipment available more rapidly and in greater numbers than had been anticipated. In fact, when all these troops have arrived, the military component of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) is likely to exceed the maximum authorized by the Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1289(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1289 (2000)</a>. I hope that, in the circumstances, the Council will be willing to set a new and more generous limit.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">That said, the logistical difficulties we face should not be underestimated. Our logistics staff is working very hard. They have arranged at very short notice for some 120 to 150 flights into Freetown's Lungi airport, using a variety of aircraft to bring troops, equipment and supplies from several different countries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">While most of these flights will use United Nations-chartered aircraft, we are very grateful to those Member States that are assisting us with this effort. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has made an invaluable contribution by securing the airport. The presence of British troops, even for a limited time and with a limited mandate, is a very important stabilizing factor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">I am also greatly encouraged by the willingness of subregional leaders, expressed at their meeting in Abuja on Tuesday, not only to contribute more troops to Sierra Leone but also to re-engage themselves politically in the quest for long-term peace and stability. We must cooperate with them in reassessing the political situation and in finding ways to reactivate the peace process. The new troops could perhaps form the nucleus of a rapid reaction force, which I remain convinced would be the best way to provide UNAMSIL with the combat capability it needs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">I know that West African leaders, among others, have also called for a revision of UNAMSIL's mandate, to give it a clear enforcement role. I am not necessarily opposed to that, but whatever mandate is decided, the first priority for the Council must be to ensure that we have the capacity to carry out the tasks that its mandate implies. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) offer of troops is very important in this respect, but it is contingent on financial and logistical support from other Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">I hope -- I should like to say, "I trust" -- that that support will now be forthcoming. A degree of regional or subregional specialization in handling security issues is quite natural and healthy, but it cannot and must not be seen as a substitute for the overall responsibility of the United Nations, and of this Council in particular. It is a refrain that the Council has heard from me before, but it has never been more pertinent than it is tonight. Africans are facing up courageously to the appalling problems of their continent. They rightly look for help to the rest of the world, especially to its more powerful and prosperous States, and most especially to the Council, which began the year with such a strong reaffirmation of its commitment to Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">This Organization has made a commitment to the people of Sierra Leone. We now face a test of our resolve to abide by that commitment. More than that, the plight of Sierra Leone and its people has become a crucial test for the fundamental solidarity between peoples, rising above race and above geography, which is the most basic guiding principle of this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">Mr. President, I plead with you: let us not fail Sierra Leone; let us not fail Africa. This time, in this crisis, let us back words with deeds, and mandates with the resources needed to make them work.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the Secretary-General for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Algeria, who wishes to make a statement on behalf of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">First of all, I should like to thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this important meeting on Sierra Leone in these particularly grave circumstances. On behalf of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and on my own behalf, I should like to congratulate you warmly on your assumption of the presidency of the Council. I should also like to wish you well in your difficult and noble mission. I congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Robert Fowler of Canada, on having so ably presided over the work of this Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute on this solemn occasion to those countries that have contributed troops to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and to convey the sincere condolences of Algeria and the OAU for the lives lost during the tragic events that have taken place recently in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Today, our Organization faces an extremely grave challenge. It is threatened as never before, in body and in soul, in its role as the last bulwark against injustice and arbitrary action, and in its action and will to preserve peace and security and to ensure that reason prevails.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Over the past few days, we have witnessed an unprecedented explosion of violence in Sierra Leone caused by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, whose principal target was the United Nations Mission in that country. Today, according to the information we have received, more than 230 UNAMSIL troops are still detained by the rebel movement, and an equal number are still missing. The people of Sierra Leone, who have undergone the worst of horrors and suffered enormously over the past eight years, are once again faced with the murderous madness of the men of Mr. Sankoh, whose commitment under the Lomé Agreement was supposed to make him into a positive actor in the rebuilding of a new Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Faced with this unacceptable challenge, the United Nations must be extremely firm and act with all the determination that the seriousness of the situation requires. Clearly, it must demand and obtain the unconditional release of all UNAMSIL personnel currently in the hands of the RUF, and it must hold that movement responsible for their safety and well-being.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">It must also, as soon as possible, regain its prestige and credibility and restore its image, which has been so seriously damaged by the criminal acts of a band of outlaws.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">In Africa, we see these indescribable actions by the RUF as a serious setback to the cause of peace -- which, thanks to work of our pan-African organization, had seen significant progress in past months -- and as an unacceptable affront to the United Nations and an even more serious affront to the very concept of the maintenance of peace in the world in general and on our continent in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Faced with this challenge, our Secretary-General has actively sought to find ways and means of ensuring an appropriate reaction by the international community so as to establish a rapid reaction force that could reverse the events in Sierra Leone, and I pay him special tribute for doing so. We also know that he has constantly been in touch with African leaders, in particular the current Chairman of the OAU, in an attempt to find a way out of the crisis. President Bouteflika has, for his part, spared no effort since the beginning of the crisis, maintaining frequent contact with the leaders in the region, particular the leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in order to cope with the challenge of the actions of the RUF.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">In this context, in a message to the summit meeting of countries members of the ECOWAS follow-up committee, which met in Abuja on 9 May, he condemned the acts of violence and hostage taking against United Nations personnel, calling them intolerable attacks against UNAMSIL and against the commendable efforts of the international community to promote the implementation of the Lomé Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">What is happening today in Sierra Leone is one of the most serious crises ever to face the United Nations, at a time when it is just beginning to find its feet in a constantly evolving world in which it is called upon to become increasingly involved in the continent.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">Our Organization's credibility is being seriously challenged, and it is in danger of having its authority reduced and its role in conflict settlement and the maintenance of international peace and security challenged.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">After the tragedies of Rwanda and Bosnia, the United Nations cannot afford another failure today. Images of Blue Helmets taken hostage, used as human shields or stripped of their weapons and uniforms by gangs of bandits are not acceptable. They are the very negation of all of the values that this world Organization personifies and a signal to the enemies of peace that the United Nations is not an institution that must always be respected or, if necessary, feared, but that it is a mere scarecrow, unable to make itself felt and to command respect.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">Less than a year ago, after much effort, ECOWAS was able, thanks to Togolese mediation and the spirit of compromise demonstrated by the legitimate Government of Sierra Leone, to see the Lomé Peace Agreement concluded. This welcome development was to put an end to years of devastating civil war, a cycle of particularly brutal violence that reached its nadir in January 1999, when rebels attacked Freetown. Sacrifices made by the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) force allowed it, at a difficult moment, to repel the attackers and protect people who had already been so sorely tried against further horror. Here, I would pay a well-deserved tribute to that force, whose work was a decisive factor in making the RUF rebels and Johnny Paul Koroma's partisans sit at the negotiating table and conclude the Lomé Agreement on 7 July 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">Need I recall here that the many appeals by ECOWAS for significant international logistic and financial assistance for ECOMOG went unanswered? Troop contributors to ECOMOG, particularly Nigeria, had to finance out of their own national resources a very burdensome operation without the strong material support they were entitled to expect from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa15">This test of UNAMSIL shows very clearly that the mandate and resources available to it are not and never were adequate to the situation. We must all recognize here that, with the mandate and pathetically small resources at its disposal, that force is unable to preserve the peace in Sierra Leone or even to protect itself against provocation and acts of violence. We would therefore solemnly appeal to the Council to review urgently the UNAMSIL mandate and then adopt a new resolution placing UNAMSIL action within the context of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, making it a peace-enforcement mission.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa16">What we ask of the United Nations is, of course, not to wage war against the rebellion, but rather that the Mission have the mandate, troops and weapons necessary to defend itself against attack by the enemies of peace. The United Nations soldiers have become the targets of rebel attacks. The force must also be able to discharge its mission to ensure and monitor compliance with the provisions of the Peace Agreement of 7 July 1999 and to protect the people against further outbreaks of violence. Increasing UNAMSIL's troop strength and giving it the weapons it needs is an essential imperative today.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa17">I should like to inform the Council of the willingness of certain members of ECOWAS, clearly stated at their 9 May summit in Abuja, to make the necessary troops available to the United Nations to strengthen its Mission in Sierra Leone. Countries with the necessary resources should, for their part, offer an appropriate logistic and financial contribution to UNAMSIL so that it can best discharge its revised mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa18">This is a matter of urgency. There is danger in delay. Africa is willing to shoulder its share of the responsibility. It expects the Security Council to react firmly and resolutely, commensurate with the grave situation in Sierra Leone and its challenges. The Council must assume its responsibilities, all its responsibilities, and the sooner the better.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Algeria for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Keita</span> <span class="nation">Mali</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">In my capacity as coordinator of the States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and on behalf of my delegation, I should like to convey our deep appreciation to you, Sir, for having convened this important meeting of the Security Council on Sierra Leone. We called for this meeting under the mandate that the heads of State of our organization, meeting in Abuja on 9 May, gave the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to convey to the ambassadors of the Africa Group in New York to do.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">We welcome the Secretary-General of the United Nations here and wish to express our deep condolences to the families of the Blue Helmets who have given their lives for the noble cause of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">The African continent, its western subregion in particular, is deeply concerned by recent developments in the Sierra Leone crisis. In truth, the hostage-taking of soldiers of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) is a defiance of the international community and cannot be tolerated. ECOWAS and Mali condemn it firmly and demand the unconditional and immediate release of the hostages, as well as the restoration of their weapons. The turn of events not only threatens international peace and security in that African subregion, but also damages the United Nations credibility with respect to peacekeeping operations, particularly in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">In the context of the flagrant violations of the Lomé Agreement, which governs the peace process in Sierra Leone, I wish to address several issues that my and other African delegations consider to need the priority attention of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">First, my delegation wishes to emphasize that the RUF leader is the party primarily responsible for the resumed civil war in Sierra Leone. Accordingly, we wish to state that, if the hostages are killed, the RUF and its leader will forfeit the amnesty benefits granted under the Lomé Agreement and prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">Secondly, by taking UNAMSIL soldiers hostage, Foday Sankoh and his movement are challenging the international community that must be met speedily. The current mandate of the Mission cannot be discharged in view of the new situation. We therefore call on the Security Council to revise the current mandate of the peacekeeping force, which would then become a peace-enforcement mission with the manpower and armaments appropriate to its mandate. This new legal framework for intervention should not imperil the Lomé Agreement, which my delegation considers to be the appropriate context for settling the civil war that has scourged Sierra Leone for more than 10 years.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">Thirdly, as the Chairman of ECOWAS, Mali wishes to convey our determination to oppose by every possible means, including military, any assumption of power by force in Sierra Leone. We stand ready to make available to the United Nations veteran forces with experience in the field to strengthen the peacekeeping Mission and restore peace in Sierra Leone. Any failure in that country would be felt deeply throughout the region and damage the credibility of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">Fourthly, my delegation is deeply concerned for the fate of civilians and displaced persons. We call for immediate steps to be taken in order to protect them and to ensure that they can be freely assisted throughout the territory of Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">We warn the leaders of the RUF not to make any attempt to invade Freetown; that would be an affront to the subregion and would be answered by force, whatever the cost.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa10">In conclusion, I would like to recall that this is a critical situation. The Security Council must act and act quickly, because what is involved is the lives of millions of persons who have placed their trust in the United Nations. We cannot betray the faith and hope that they have placed in our Organization. Any failure of the United Nations would be fraught with consequences for the continuation of peacekeeping operations in Africa.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Eldon</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The Secretary-General's presence with us and the statement he has just made testify to the importance of our debate tonight.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The situation in Sierra Leone is very serious. All of us have followed the events of the past days in Sierra Leone with a sense of foreboding. The present tragic breakdown could have dire consequences. We are especially conscious of the suffering of the people of Sierra Leone. If the response of the United Nations and the international community does not match up to the challenge, the consequences will be far-reaching -- not just for Sierra Leone, but also for Africa, United Nations peacekeeping and the United Nations itself. My delegation is grateful to the African Group for taking the initiative in calling this meeting, and grateful to you, Mr. President, for arranging it so rapidly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">We must focus now on the immediate crisis. I do not want to spend too much time and energy allocating blame. But my delegation is in no doubt at whose door the principal responsibility should be laid. Foday Sankoh and his Revolutionary United Front (RUF) supporters have flagrantly violated the peace agreements to which he and they are a party. Sankoh stands condemned before the international community, including in statements by this Council. He and his colleagues must bear responsibility for what has happened over the last few days. As the Secretary-General and others have said, they must be held accountable for their actions.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">We must now take the action necessary to ensure that Sankoh and his supporters do not succeed in breaking the peace for which the ordinary people of Sierra Leone yearn and which they so richly deserve. We are firmly of the view that the cornerstone of our efforts must be the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). An effective United Nations force, fully staffed and equipped to meet its mandate, offers the best hope for restoring lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">The United Kingdom has taken a number of important steps to support UNAMSIL. Last weekend we deployed the British Spearhead Battalion to Freetown. That deployment is primarily for the evacuation of United Kingdom nationals. But we also believe that the deployment of our troops, who have secured Lungi airport, made a real contribution to the efforts of UNAMSIL. We have kept that vital link open and thus freed up UNAMSIL troops to concentrate on their wider task. I am grateful to the Secretary-General for his kind words about the effect the presence of our forces has had, and I will ensure that they are passed on to those concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">Today, following a review of the situation in Sierra Leone with Cabinet colleagues, Prime Minister Blair confirmed that the British forces in Sierra Leone would continue their mission to evacuate United Kingdom and other nationals, and to secure Lungi airport, while the United Nations force builds up over the next month. There is no question of British troops being deployed in a combat role as part of the United Nations force, nor of an open-ended commitment. The arrival in the area of HMS <i>Ocean</i>, with her embarked marines, will provide further force flexibility and be in a position to relieve those forces already in theatre, if necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">A United Kingdom military advisory team is also in Freetown, at United Nations request, to help the United Nations assess what technical support is needed to strengthen UNAMSIL. The United Kingdom will continue to offer technical and logistical support to help strengthen the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">UNAMSIL has borne the brunt of Sankoh's actions and suffered the consequences. I pay an unreserved tribute to the way in which its Commander, General Jetley, and his colleagues have dealt with the present difficult situation. Similar tributes are due to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and those engaged on Sierra Leone in New York. Our thoughts are with those UNAMSIL personnel who have been detained by the RUF. As the Secretary-General has said, they must be released, and quickly. And our hearts go out to the families of those who have given their lives in the service of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">My delegation also wishes to pay tribute to the efforts of regional leaders who have worked hard to support the Government of Sierra Leone. It is imperative that they, and all of us, put as much pressure as possible on Foday Sankoh to return to the path of peaceful dialogue and political progress charted in the Lomé Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">The response of the United Nations to the crisis holds the key to its future solution. The Security Council has a grave responsibility. It is essential that we get things right. We must therefore keep our eye firmly on the immediate objective: to reinforce UNAMSIL and get it up to strength. We are grateful to the Governments of India, Bangladesh and Jordan for expediting the deployment of their battalions. That deployment must take place as quickly as possible. We welcome the willingness of the Economic Community of West African States leaders, following their summit meeting in Abuja on 9 May, to consider, in the event of new involvement of regional forces in Sierra Leone, the practical modalities of such involvement. Any new troops should be blue-hatted, properly equipped for the job they have to do, under a single United Nations chain of command and with the same rules of engagement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa11">Progress is now being made, and we obviously welcome that. The United Kingdom team at Lungi will be working with UNAMSIL to see how more air movements can be handled through the airport, thus relieving this potential bottleneck in efforts to strengthen UNAMSIL.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa12">For the moment, UNAMSIL's mandate is sufficient for it to carry out its tasks. It is already a strong one. It contains elements that allow for the use of force in self-defence and, where possible, in defence of the civilian population. Clearly, as the situation evolves, we should look at the tasks we expect UNAMSIL to carry out. The decision on how to mandate the Mission will depend on those tasks. Once the situation has stabilized, we will be better placed to look at those issues. We will need the Secretary-General's professional advice, which will no doubt be based on Under-Secretary-General Miyet's assessment. That need not take long to produce. But we should be wary of adopting an over-hasty approach. The Secretary-General was right to point out that changing UNAMSIL's mandate will not of itself change it into an effective peace enforcement mission; and moving to peace enforcement would be a radical change of approach. We should think carefully about whether this is right or practicable.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa13">It is clear what the immediate response to the crisis has to be. We must not take our eye off the ball. We must get UNAMSIL up to strength. Those who can help achieve this must do so quickly. This Council must send a clear message of political support for UNAMSIL, and it must be ready to do anything necessary to assist UNAMSIL's reinforcement. The United Kingdom has already done a great deal. Our efforts will continue. The people of Sierra Leone have waited for peace and stability for far too long.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Canada is seriously concerned over the situation in Sierra Leone, because of both the grave danger to many of the people of Sierra Leone and the repugnant image of hundreds of troops of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) being detained by a signatory of the Lomé Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">As UNAMSIL consolidates its positions, the international community must expedite and revive its efforts to support the mission. On the ground, the United Nations is maintaining its position, and its Members must do the same. We must remain firm in our commitment not to abandon Sierra Leone or the people that the Council has put in a dangerous situation and has mandated to carry out its orders on behalf of all the Members of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Canada was proud to announce yesterday that it would offer an air lift for rapid deployment of troops from India and Bangladesh. We are now considering increasing our assistance to UNAMSIL troops, who are without sufficient equipment. That decision supplements earlier contributions by Canada, which has sent military observers and which continues to provide significant humanitarian-assistance support to Sierra Leone. We have also made a significant contribution to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme and are ready to renew our support when the situation in Sierra Leone becomes stable.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">We have seen how the rapid deployment of a highly professional contingent from the United Kingdom to Freetown and to Lungi helped stabilize the situation. We hope that when the international military presence is stepped up, those charged with maintaining the peace, along with civilians, will be threatened less, and that conditions will be met for resuming the peace process. We must show true and strong determination, and must ensure that civilians will not be left to face the rebel terror, as they were in January 1999.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa01">Canada is encouraged by the results of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) summit held at Abuja on 9 May and by the continued commitment of West African States to a peaceful and stable Sierra Leone. ECOWAS has demonstrated its capacity to make a difference in Sierra Leone in the past, at great cost in money and in lives. Specifically, the West African force -- the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) -- has amply demonstrated its ability to constrain violence by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). ECOWAS member States, and most particularly Nigeria, are already playing a key role in UNAMSIL and will, we fervently hope, agree to make an even larger contribution to deterring further aggression on the part of the RUF.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa02">It is imperative that the peacekeeping effort in Sierra Leone be truly multilateral and under the United Nations flag, and that the burden associated with fielding and deploying that force be shared among Member States. Canada encourages Member States to work towards the creation of a strong, united and cohesive force to restore a climate of confidence and order in Sierra Leone. That force, we believe, should take the form of an expanded UNAMSIL and should respect the fundamental military principle of unity of command, in this case the command of Major-General Jetley.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa03">The Security Council agreed in October 1999, when the UNAMSIL mandate was approved, that a hybrid force for Sierra Leone was undesirable, dangerous, unjust and unworkable, and could lead to further instability and confusion. The Council must recommit itself to establishing a strong, united and credible force in the face of appalling provocation on the part of the RUF. We, should also be prepared to revisit UNAMSIL's mandate in the light of the fundamental changes in the situation on the ground and to re-examine, on a regular basis, UNAMSIL's requirements in personnel and capabilities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa04">UNAMSIL has a strong mandate with provisions for the protection of civilians. What we need now are appropriate resources to prevent further slippage. Canada is extremely troubled by reports by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) that more than half of the children who have participated in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme are at risk of being re-recruited by rebel forces, or of being punished by them for desertion. Ensuring the safety of those 900 children must be an immediate priority of UNAMSIL once it regains the upper hand in its areas of deployment.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa05">The threat of sliding back into civil war in Sierra Leone demonstrates yet again the need for a radically improved capacity for rapid reaction by the United Nations. Specifically, Canada encourages Member States to commit themselves to improving the capability of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the areas of military planning services, Headquarters oversight, access to reliable field-level intelligence, effective communications and longer term contingency planning. Earlier today, the Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, called a special meeting in Lucerne of representatives of the 13 members of the Human Security Network at which the topic of United Nations peacekeeping capacity was discussed. The members agreed to work together and examine steps for possible action.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa06">While we should continue to direct our efforts towards reinforcing the contingents already in the field, we cannot lose sight of the unfulfilled requirements of effective peacekeeping. We must address these if we are to consolidate peace and security in Sierra Leone and put an end to eight years of needless suffering. As we work to strengthen UNAMSIL and the ability of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to plan for and assist the mission as it adapts to changing circumstances, Council members must also take a strong and clear-eyed stand in addressing the roots of this crisis, and indeed of the conflict in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa07">In addition to condemning in the strongest terms the illegal detention of UNAMSIL civilian and military personnel, we must undertake to hold accountable the parties responsible for these breaches of the Lomé Peace Agreement, including RUF leader Foday Sankoh. The Council should examine all avenues at its disposal for ensuring that the violence perpetrated in the name of greed in Sierra Leone does not go unpunished. We wish to stress that we do not consider the United Nations to be bound by the Lomé amnesty provisions as they apply to genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international law.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa08">We must also undertake to address the role of both the illicit diamond trade and small-arms trafficking in fuelling and sustaining this conflict. Specifically, Council members should consider a range of targeted measures to ensure that diamond revenues are used exclusively for the purposes specified in the Lomé Peace Agreement, that is for the benefit of the people of Sierra Leone. Canada looks forward to the report of the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Miyet, tomorrow, and will give sympathetic consideration to any recommendations from the Secretary-General for further Council action in support of UNAMSIL.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hasmy</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening an open emergency meeting of the Security Council tonight to consider the rapidly deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone. We support that decision, as we believe that the broader membership of the Organization, in particular the African States, should have an opportunity to be heard on this very important subject.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">My delegation expresses once again its grave concern at the outbreak of violence in Sierra Leone over the past two weeks, and condemns in the strongest terms the armed attacks perpetrated by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) against United Nations personnel. We note with deep regret the losses suffered by the Kenyan peacekeeping battalion of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), and would like to take this opportunity to extend our sympathy and condolences to the families of the fallen peacekeepers and to the Government of Kenya. Scores of others have been wounded, and some 500 United Nations personnel, including personnel from Malaysia, are still being detained by the rebel forces. This is an unacceptable state of affairs, and every effort should be made and all necessary means used to secure their release.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Through a presidential statement on 4 May 2000, the Council demanded that the RUF cease its hostile actions and release immediately and unharmed all detained United Nations and other international personnel. This has not been heeded by Mr. Foday Sankoh and his followers. As leader of the RUF, Mr. Sankoh is ultimately responsible for these deplorable actions, which are in clear violation of the obligations under the Lomé Peace Agreement. He must be held accountable.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">My delegation agrees with the view that among the immediate priorities are for UNAMSIL to strengthen its presence by regrouping in larger numbers to enable the force to better defend itself should it come under rebel attack. The stabilization of the situation around the Freetown peninsula is also an immediate priority, and we look forward with some urgency to the early arrival of the additional battalions from India, Bangladesh and Jordan to bring UNAMSIL to its authorized strength. In this regard, we commend the role played by the British forces in securing the main airport in Freetown.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">While we commend Force Commander Jetley and Special Representative Adeniji for their respective roles in managing the crisis on the ground, we strongly believe that the time has come for the Council to consider the possible next steps. At the top of our agenda should be the dispatch of a rapid reaction force to Sierra Leone for the purpose of stabilizing the situation and putting the political process back on track. We commend the Secretary-General for his frenetic efforts in mobilizing such a force. We urge countries with the resources to do so to respond promptly to the efforts of the Secretary-General so that the rapid reaction force can be dispatched forthwith.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">We do not think that a United Nations withdrawal from Sierra Leone is an option to be considered. That would be sending the wrong message to the peace-loving people of Sierra Leone -- who have endured so much in the last nine years -- and to Africa as a whole, another example of the international community abandoning the continent yet again. That option also risks inviting a run at Freetown by the RUF. However, we do believe that the peacekeeping environment in which we envisaged UNAMSIL to be operating under when we adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1289(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1289 (2000)</a> is no longer relevant in the present circumstances. The premise of having a peace agreement on the table and having parties to the conflict fully cooperating in its implementation, including the voluntary disarmament of armed elements under the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR), is in the process of unravelling, if it is not already unravelled.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">We will have to make an immediate, in-depth evaluation of the situation -- both on the military and political fronts -- and take appropriate decisions. We run the risk of having United Nations personnel being overrun by the RUF, who are intent not only on destroying the DDR process -- as evidenced in the last few months -- but on challenging the resolve of UNAMSIL in the wake of the full withdrawal from Sierra Leone of the forces of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). Clearly, the actions of the RUF have been well timed and orchestrated. A few more weeks and UNAMSIL would have been strengthened further with extra battalions, and the disarmament process would have been consolidated.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">My delegation deeply regrets that the RUF has challenged not only the peace process, but also the largest United Nations force the Organization has mounted anywhere. The credibility of the Council is at stake. Criticisms have been voiced that the United Nations force deployed in Sierra Leone was ill equipped, or not adequately mandated, to deal with the demands of the situation on the ground. The question of whether the limited Chapter VII mandate at present given to UNAMSIL continues to be adequate must be promptly examined in the light of the hard realities on the ground and in the context of the changed environment from that originally envisaged. My delegation would like to recall that we had been willing to go with the limited Chapter VII mandate then because there was an agreement on the table and because the cooperation of the parties was assured to be forthcoming. Clearly, many of us have been proven wrong and we will have to recalibrate our response appropriately.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">We welcome the decision of the recently concluded ECOWAS summit in Abuja for its members to use all means at their disposal, including the military option, to foil any attempt to take over power in Sierra Leone through the use of force. Such a rapid deployment will be helpful, and we look forward to the decision to be taken at the meeting of the ministers of defence and chiefs of staff to be held in Abuja on 17 May 2000 to consider the practical modalities in the event of a new ECOMOG involvement in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">Malaysia has consistently advocated that ECOMOG contributing countries -- particularly Nigeria, which has shouldered a disproportionate burden of ECOMOG forces in Sierra Leone in the past -- be assisted in maintaining its forces there. The situation has now come full circle, and ECOMOG is once again poised to play a pivotal role to assist the international community in restoring order in the country. The offer must be accepted. However, we believe that under the present circumstances all countries deploying troops in Sierra Leone should come under the United Nations banner and under one command structure. Adequate resources must be found for this purpose. This is the responsibility of all Member States, big and small.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa11">The real test of our resolve will come in the coming days and weeks. The situation calls for a rapid and cohesive response from the Organization and from the international community at large. It is our fervent hope that tonight's deliberations, and subsequent Council deliberations, will lead to action that will reverse this sorry state of affairs and re-establish the authority and credibility of the Organization over the situation in Sierra Leone. This is imperative because of its ramifications, not only in Africa but world-wide. My delegation agrees with the Secretary-General that we must act, and act quickly, for we cannot afford to fail the people of Sierra Leone; we cannot afford to fail Africa yet again.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Unfortunately, the Security Council is meeting in emergency session tonight because a grave crisis is under way in Sierra Leone. Unfolding events threaten yet again to undermine the democratically elected government of President Kabbah. Renewed violence has initiated another round of human suffering for the people of Sierra Leone, a people who have suffered too much already.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The American Government and the American people have viewed events in Sierra Leone with shock and dismay. Despite the presence of more than 8,500 United Nations peacekeepers, those who oppose peace in Sierra Leone, especially the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, have initiated new attacks and detained hundreds United Nations and other international personnel. Such actions are totally unacceptable, and this threat to peace and security must be brought to an end.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">We all know that peacekeeping is inherently risky. We commend the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and its troops, and the Secretary-General and his staff, for their commitment and for their attempts to respond to the difficult situation in which they have found themselves. But we must be clear that the fault for the current tragedy in Sierra Leone lies with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and its leader, Foday Sankoh, for their violations of the commitments undertaken in the Lomé Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">Unless the situation is resolved and the peace process put back on track, we could be faced with a resumption of one of the most ruthless and brutal rebellions in the world. The conflict could spill over Sierra Leone's borders, engulfing neighbouring States and threatening stability throughout West Africa. We could face a general reluctance to support United Nations peacekeeping in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">We strongly support the United Nations peacekeepers. They were organized and sent to Sierra Leone not to impose a settlement, not to enforce the peace, but to assist in the implementation of the Lomé Peace Agreement, an accord which the RUF signed, then violated, and finally subverted by launching their recent attacks. RUF actions against the members of the United Nations peacekeeping force are outrageous and in direct violation of the Lomé Peace Agreement. Acting as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) withdrew, and before United Nations forces were fully deployed, the RUF acted in a deliberate, cynical manner to subvert and reverse the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">The United States calls on the RUF immediately to release all detainees, cease all military operations, comply with its commitments under the Lomé Peace Agreement and respect all applicable norms of international human rights and humanitarian law. We concur with the view expressed by regional leaders at the ECOWAS Heads of State summit in Abuja on 9 May, condemning the actions of the RUF. We also note that ECOWAS heads of State warned the RUF leadership that "it runs the risk of revocation of the amnesty earlier granted to the members of the movement under the Lomé Peace Agreement, as well as being tried for war crimes if they continue to flout the Lomé Peace Agreement". We welcome the decision reached in Abuja to convene a special meeting of ECOWAS defence ministers on 17 May to consider the practical modalities should ECOMOG forces renew their involvement in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">We commend and support the leadership demonstrated by the regional States and by ECOWAS in promoting political and diplomatic initiatives to stabilize the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">My Government is seized of this issue at the highest levels. Secretary Albright has been in regular contact with the Secretary-General. President Clinton also reviewed the situation with Mr. Annan this morning. We are consulting closely with the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">President Clinton has asked the Reverend Jesse Jackson, his Special Envoy for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights in Africa, to return to the region to work with leaders there for a resolution of this crisis. Reverend Jackson has been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to help the people of Sierra Leone to realize their peaceful intentions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">We have intensified our continuing collaboration at the highest levels with the Government of Sierra Leone, with the United Nations in New York and Freetown, with other regional leaders and with our British colleagues. In that regard, we join others in acknowledging the United Kingdom's important contribution in securing Lungi airport. Our Ambassador to Sierra Leone, Joseph Melrose, remains in Freetown and is in constant communication with the Government of Sierra Leone and other key officials.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa11">Our focus continues to be on finding the best possible measures to seek the release of all United Nations and other international personnel who remain detained, to protect civilians, to restore stability and to reinforce the international presence in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa12">The United States will assist the deployment of additional troops for UNAMSIL. We are working hard with other interested States to find ways to accelerate the deployment of remaining battalions. The United States is prepared to help transport additional troops to Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa13">We are also examining the possibilities of providing equipment support for the international forces there. We are now determining the kinds and quantities of equipment that can be most helpful. We are working to develop a coordinated approach with other members for delivery.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa14">We intend to support the commitment West African nations have made to send additional troops to Sierra Leone and a United States military team is in Nigeria to determine what assistance may be needed. The United States remains committed to working in partnership with Africa. We will continue our efforts to support and strengthen African regional organizations and initiatives and their ongoing efforts to ensure peace and stability throughout the region.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. van Walsum</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">We are here to listen to the Secretary-General and to other delegations, especially those that represent African organizations such as the Organization of African Unity or the Economic Community of West African States, so I shall be very brief.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">The Secretary-General stated very clearly that Mr. Sankoh must be held accountable and we have heard this echoed by all other speakers.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Last year, the signing of the Lomé Agreement was welcomed with a sense of relief. At last there seemed to be hope for peace in Sierra Leone. But parts of the Lomé Peace Agreement clearly did not bode well for future peace. Important Government posts were set aside for perpetrators of monstrous crimes, and a blanket amnesty was decreed for them with, almost unbelievably, a special amnesty provision for Mr. Sankoh.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The Netherlands delegation expressed its dismay at these provisions at the time because we felt they conveyed a dangerous message, namely, that committing unspeakable atrocities pays. We proposed to include a reference to our concerns in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1260(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1260 (1999)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1270(1999).pdf" class="pdf">1270 (1999)</a> but we were prevailed upon not to insist because any talk of accountability was likely to prolong the war.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Today, we can only wonder to what extent the international community's failure to insist on the Revolutionary United Front's accountability may have contributed to Mr. Sankoh's current foolhardiness. In any case, it must be clear that someone who flouts the Lomé Agreement cannot invoke that same Agreement as a basis for his impunity. The Lomé Agreement binds only the countries that are parties to it. The Security Council cannot deviate from what it has repeatedly and solemnly stated with regard to the need "to bring to justice, in an appropriate manner, individuals who incite or cause violence against civilians in situations of armed conflict or who otherwise violate international humanitarian and human rights law." (<i><a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1999-6.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1999/6</a></i>)</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">We continue to hold the view that without full accountability for the atrocities committed in Sierra Leone, no lasting peace can be established in that country.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chowdhury</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this emergency meeting of the Security Council at the request of the African Group. We have supported such a meeting because we believe that the grave situation in Sierra Leone demands that the wider membership of the United Nations should openly discuss the emergency in that country. We thank the Secretary-General for his presence at today's meeting and for his important statement. We appreciate the valuable statements made by Algeria as the current Chair of the Organization of African Unity and by Mali as Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Chairman, and fully support their recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">Bangladesh is extremely concerned at the deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone. We see it as a challenge for the United Nations and for the international community as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">The people of Sierra Leone have gone through nine years of suffering. The Lomé Peace Agreement promised an end to that. We had placed our trust in Lomé, believing that it would work, and acted accordingly in mandating the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). With the recent developments in Sierra Leone, we have to take a fresh look at the peace structure and the peacekeeping mandate we had provided. We also have to rethink our strategy of placing too much emphasis on the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leadership for reaching a peaceful solution in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">We believe strongly that the United Nations cannot and must not abandon Sierra Leone. We must not wait on the sidelines as events unfold there. It would be a decisive setback to the credibility of United Nations peacekeeping if we allowed the largest peacekeeping mission ever to fail.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">The question that we should address tonight is what should the Security Council do to effectively address the problem in Sierra Leone. We believe that we should pursue the following course of action.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">First, we have to bolster UNAMSIL by bringing it up to its mandated strength at the earliest date. We continue to believe strongly that additional numbers on the ground would make a difference. In this regard, I would like to inform the Council that the battalion Bangladesh promised to UNAMSIL will be ready for airlifting along with all its equipment by 20 May.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">Secondly, we have to look into the possibility of mobilizing more troops than the mandated strength. In this connection, Bangladesh is encouraged that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries will be providing forces to bring stability to Sierra Leone. We welcome the Abuja summit and the determined will of the ECOWAS members, expressed in the final communiqué of the meeting, to act to bring peace to Sierra Leone. We also thank other countries that have been forthcoming in this regard. On the basis of past experience in Sierra Leone, Bangladesh strongly believes that the entire international military presence there should be under an integrated United Nations command. There must be one international mandate provided by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">Allow me to digress here to mention that concerns have been voiced in some quarters that United Nations peacekeeping is dysfunctional because the troops the United Nations deploys -- troops mostly from the developing countries -- are often ill- equipped, ill-trained and ill-prepared to address the situation at hand. The unfortunate reality is that if developing countries stopped responding to the frantic calls of the United Nations today, there would be no peacekeeping tomorrow, barring a few of the choicest areas in the world which are of significant strategic interest to major Powers. We should be grateful that developing countries continue to make contributions to United Nations peacekeeping. Their efforts alleviate the sufferings of millions around the world and uphold the United Nations Charter. Blaming the failure on the peacekeeper is the easy way out of fulfilling our collective responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">We believe that in Sierra Leone, Force Commander General Jetley and his troops have faced the situation courageously and should have all our praise for their valiant efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Thirdly, as soon as possible, we have to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation and weigh all options before us. We understand Mr. Bernard Miyet returned from Sierra Leone earlier today, and it would have been good if this meeting could have benefited from his preliminary assessment. However, we will expect a full assessment by the Secretariat and also recommendations of possible options at the earliest date.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Fourthly, we have to revisit the UNAMSIL mandate to strengthen it. Clearly we need a much more robust mandate for a long-term solution of the problem in Sierra Leone. Bangladesh believes that a full Chapter VII mandate for UNAMSIL is needed to make it effective.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">Fifthly and finally, the humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone is a matter of concern to us. United Nations agencies and international humanitarian organizations have suspended their operations, barring a few exceptions. There are distressing reports of population movements and atrocities committed against civilians. We have to look into ways to address the needs of the innocent victims of violence in Sierra Leone.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Andjaba</span> <span class="nation">Namibia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Let me thank you, Sir, for convening this important meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">I wish to extend my delegation's condolences to the Governments and those families who lost people in Sierra Leone. Our thoughts are with those being detained by the rebels.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Let me also pay special tribute to the countries who have contributed troops to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). We commend the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Force Commander of UNAMSIL for their leadership and untiring efforts to keep the peace process on track under the most adverse conditions. We also wish to salute the men and women of UNAMSIL for their courage under extremely difficult conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">The presence of the Secretary-General here tonight is appreciated by my delegation. We thank you, Mr. Secretary-General, for your statement, and we commend you for the efforts you are making to bring peace to Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">When we adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1270(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1270 (1999)</a> on 22 October last year, we did so, among other reasons, to commit the international community, and in particular United Nations Member States, to assist the people of Sierra Leone in restoring their democratically elected Government. Indeed, by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1270(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1270 (1999)</a> the Security Council acted to carry out its responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">After the continuing long series of most brutal and barbaric atrocities that the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) unleashed on the people of Sierra Leone -- notably, children and even infants -- the Government and people of Sierra Leone, who needed peace more than anything, accepted the Lomé Agreement. Indeed, we all had hoped that, given what the people of Sierra Leone were subjected to, the way to peace was not to isolate those who stood in the way of peace but to include them.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">Today, the RUF has clearly demonstrated that it was never interested in peace. As a party to the conflict, the RUF did not have the political will to abide by the provisions of the Peace Agreement. They have, and continue to, openly and explicitly challenged the United Nations, if not embarrassing the international community. This we must not allow. Therefore the events in Sierra Leone should galvanize the international community to take effective measures to address this unfolding crisis. We must do so indeed because UNAMSIL is a collective undertaking. If it fails, it will be collective failure. When it succeeds, we all will have succeeded.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">It must be stressed that UNAMSIL did not have the necessary deterrent capacity. The first test by the rebels confirmed the extreme vulnerability of the Mission. UNAMSIL was outnumbered and did not have the required equipment. The mandate of UNAMSIL was inadequate for the task at hand. We hesitated to set ourselves clear and realistic goals.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">This is not an attempt to apportion blame, but rather an effort to establish why we went wrong. More importantly, however, we must exercise our collective responsibility in determining what we can do now, together, to put back on track the peace process in Sierra Leone. Of course, some have more capacity than others, but we must all act. In this connection, let me express our profound gratitude to the Government of the United Kingdom for sending troops to secure Lungi airport. Our thanks also go to all those Governments that have offered transportation to bring reinforcements to Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">The task before us is clear. The political realities on the ground and the continued detention of United Nations personnel demand that we review the mandate of UNAMSIL. In fact, the summit of the leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recently held in Abuja has facilitated our task. Namibia therefore fully supports a reinforced UNAMSIL. The strength of UNAMSIL must be boosted. The mandate of UNAMSIL must be brought fully under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, without modifications. Namibia welcomes the decision of ECOWAS to put ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) troops immediately at the disposal of UNAMSIL so that they can be integrated into the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">Our collective responsibility demands that the strengthened UNAMSIL be augmented with the necessary equipment. Many troop-contributing countries do not have equipment that will make a Chapter VII mandate meaningful. Therefore, we appeal to those in a position to contribute equipment to UNAMSIL to come to the rescue of humanity and peace in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa12">We cannot and must not abdicate our responsibility in Sierra Leone and pass it to ECOMOG. If we do, the least we can do is provide ECOMOG with financial and logistical support. To this end, we look forward to the recommendations of the Secretary-General and the speedy adoption of a relevant draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa13">We are already seeing mass population displacement, and unless we act, there is going to be a humanitarian crisis, given that many humanitarian workers have already been evacuated to neighbouring countries for safety.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa14">We are grateful to all Member States who have committed their forces and made other contributions to the UNAMSIL operations in Sierra Leone. No doubt, the success or failure of UNAMSIL can have an impact on the future of United Nations peacekeeping operations. Notwithstanding this possibility, the crisis in Sierra Leone should not determine the future of peacekeeping operations in Africa. We must not fail the people of Africa, for this will have catastrophic consequences for international peace and security.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Listre</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">Firstly, I should like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting in the form of an open debate. This will enhance the transparency of the deliberations of the Council and give us an opportunity to hear the opinions of other Members of the Organization, which will certainly be very helpful to us given the difficult situation with which we are confronted. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for his presence with us during this debate.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Argentina reiterates unambiguously its total condemnation of the events unfolding in Sierra Leone. What is occurring in that country is very serious. A rebel movement characterized by its acts of atrocity is once again flouting the authority of the United Nations and is now arrogating to itself the power to disarm and deprive of their liberty entire contingents of the United Nations force deployed there.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Despite the fact that it had inflicted terrible suffering on its people, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) was included in the negotiations that led to the Lomé Agreement. Despite the outrages committed by that rebel movement against the civilian population, the need to pacify the country led to tolerance being extended to its leaders, who escaped judgement and punishment by means of an amnesty.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">All of these concessions were in vain. The Revolutionary United Front is now flouting the Lomé Agreement and the standards governing the protection of United Nations personnel. These violations and the taking of hostages are unacceptable and must not be tolerated. The leader of the RUF, Mr. Foday Sankoh, may have escaped responsibility, through the Lomé Agreement, for massive human rights violations in the past, but this time he must be held personally accountable for the acts committed by the irregular troops that he leads.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">The Security Council must give a prompt and adequate response to this emergency. We cannot allow this situation to continue and the tragic acts of January 1999 to be repeated.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">We wish to express our support to President Kabbah, the democratic legitimacy of his Government and the values of liberty and tolerance. The Government of Sierra Leone demonstrated these values when it asked the rebel forces to join in the dialogue and when it signed the Lomé Agreement. We must not forget that the ultimate solution to the problems that are afflicting the country must be political, not military.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">Unfortunately, the good faith of President Kabbah's Government has not been reciprocated. From the start, we have been aware of the fact that United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) forces might have to confront a hostile environment, and, unfortunately, this has been confirmed by recent events. The current situation makes it even more necessary to strengthen UNAMSIL. We must speed up the transportation of the battalions that have been pledged in order to provide the required number of troops and the equipment needed to deal with the current situation. In this connection, I believe that we must wait until Under-Secretary-General Miyet, who has just returned from Sierra Leone, has conveyed to the Secretary-General his impressions of the situation on the ground, and the Secretary-General has communicated his conclusions to us.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">However, we already support the Secretary-General's request to increase the number of troops to 11,100, as is provided for, if necessary, in the relevant resolution. But we stress that we must act as quickly as possible. This is a particularly difficult moment for Africa, and the evolution of events in Sierra Leone may have an impact on other conflicts in the region that are currently being considered by the Security Council, and we must not let that happen.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">We do not wish to conclude without expressing Argentina's acknowledgement of the work of Under-Secretary-General Miyet, the staff of the United Nations Secretariat, especially the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Adeniji, and the States members of the Economic Community of West African States, for their work. We should also like to express our appreciation to the States that have contributed to UNAMSIL and to those that have continued to pledge their support as these tragic events have unfolded.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">We should like in particular to offer our sincere condolences to the families of the members of UNAMSIL who have lost their lives or been deprived of their liberty. We should also like to thank United Kingdom for its prompt dispatch of military forces to Sierra Leone to secure Lungi airport, which has surely contributed and will continue to contribute to making the task of UNAMSIL easier at such a difficult moment.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa11">Finally, I should like to comment on the question of the necessity of changing the mandate through the adoption of a new resolution, an issue that has been raised earlier in the debate by several speakers. My delegation believes that it might be helpful to review again the question of the mandate, and we would not oppose any change in the mandate if it were necessary. But I should like to emphasize that at this time the mandate given to UNAMSIL in paragraph 10 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1289(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1289 (2000)</a> is sufficiently strong to serve in present circumstances, particularly in it affirmation that UNAMSIL can take all necessary measures to guarantee the security and freedom of movement of its personnel and to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">The Russian Federation shares the concern over developments in the situation in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">The activities of the fighters of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) have brought the peace process in that country to the brink of collapse. Today, when the air is heavy with renewed fighting in Sierra Leone, stirring up memories within the international community that have not even had time to fade -- memories of acts of inconceivable cruelty with which the eight-year history of the conflict is rife -- we call on the leadership of the RUF to think again, to cease violating the Lomé Peace Agreement and, together with other political forces in the country, to help overcome the consequences of this conflict. At the same, we deem it necessary to remind the RUF leaders that the amnesty provided for in the Lomé Peace Agreement does not extend to crimes committed after its signing.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Events in Sierra Leone have challenged the peacekeeping operation which the Security Council authorized in support of implementation by the parties of the commitments they freely agreed to in the Lomé Agreement. The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) has suffered losses. United Nations peacekeepers have been captured by bandits, as has been a Russian military observer. We convey our condolences to the families of those who have given their lives for peace in Sierra Leone, which has suffered so terribly. We firmly demand the release of detained United Nations and other international personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">The mandate given UNAMSIL in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1289(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1289 (2000)</a> allows sufficiently strong measures to be taken to ensure the safety of international personnel in the country and of the Government of Sierra Leone. Of key importance here is the effective exercise by the military contingent of its mandate. In this connection, we attach paramount importance to the speedy increase of the numbers of UNAMSIL to 11,100 soldiers and officers, as approved in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1289(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1289 (2000)</a>. Russia and the United Nations are currently addressing the practical issues of providing an airlift to Sierra Leone for additional units being made available to UNAMSIL and of sending a number of Russian military helicopters to Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">We have no doubt that UNAMSIL -- which, once fully deployed, will become the largest United Nations peacekeeping contingent -- will be able to stabilize the situation in the country. This will create the necessary conditions for the Council calmly to consider the various options for overcoming the crisis in Sierra Leone. Without excluding any options, we continue to believe that no peacekeeping operation, including a peace-enforcement operation, can replace a political settlement of the conflict, which is possible only if the parties have the political will.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Miss Durrant</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">The Jamaican delegation joins others in thanking you, Sir, for convening this meeting on the situation in Sierra Leone. We all agree that such a meeting is not only timely, but an imperative, given the urgency of the situation. We therefore commend the African Group for taking the initiative in calling for this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">The statements of the Secretary-General and of the Permanent Representative of Algeria, acting as Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, only served to underline the gravity of the threat that the crisis in Sierra Leone now poses to the people of that country, to the neighbouring countries and to the resolve of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">After several years of civil strife, which wreaked untold havoc on the people of Sierra Leone, the Lomé accords held out the hope of peace and stability in which the country could at long last address its serious economic and social needs. It was only in February of this year that the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was mandated by the Security Council to undertake the tasks of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; to coordinate and assist in the provision of security in and at all sites in common areas of deployment with the Sierra Leone security forces; and, above all, to monitor the implementation of the Lomé Peace Agreement, which had been subscribed to by all parties concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">We commend those troops which went to Sierra Leone to serve the cause of peace and we wish to take this opportunity to express our condolences to the families of those who have given their lives. We join in condemning Mr. Foday Sankoh and the forces of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which have not only tried to scuttle the Lomé Peace Agreement, but have attacked and taken hostage those who sought to bring peace to the people of Sierra Leone. We join the call for the unconditional release of those detained and taken hostage and hold Mr. Sankoh fully accountable for the actions of the members of the RUF.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">The Security Council and the international community have few options. Our priority must be to obtain the release of those detained and held hostage and to stabilize the situation so that order can be re-established throughout Sierra Leone. The present outbreak of hostilities has again put the lives of civilians at risk and threatens the stability of the neighbouring States.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">It is against this background that my delegation strongly supports the call of the heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for UNAMSIL's mandate to be revised under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and for the troops to be equipped to carry out such a mandate. We wish to take this opportunity to express appreciation to the troop-contributing countries, including Bangladesh, India and Jordan, which have pledged to rapidly increase the troop strength of UNAMSIL to its authorized level, and also to thank those countries which are providing strategic airlifts. We also commend the action of the British Government in stabilizing the situation in the Lungi airport area, as this has provided a valuable complement to the work of UNAMSIL.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">While we are fully aware that there is no clear-cut solution, my delegation fully endorses the options put forth by ECOWAS, which call, <i>inter alia</i>, for the integration of ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) troops into UNAMSIL, and call upon the international community to commit the necessary funding and logistical expertise as required. We also look forward to the outcome of the meeting of the Ministers of Defence and Chiefs of Staff of ECOWAS, to be held in Abuja on 17 May, to consider practical modalities. We cannot forget that it was the troops of ECOMOG who acted to stabilize the situation and to bring peace to the people of Sierra Leone, which allowed for the signing of the Lomé Peace Agreement. The Council will also benefit from the report of the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Bernard Miyet, who was just in Sierra Leone to assess the political and military realities.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">There is one option that we do not have, and that is to abandon the people of Sierra Leone, who are looking to this Organization in their hour of need. As I said earlier, civilians are again on the move in Sierra Leone, becoming refugees in their own country, and have moved into neighbouring countries. International humanitarian agencies have had to scale down their activities and normal life has been disrupted across the land.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">In the next few days and weeks, this Council and the international community must display its resolve, stated in this very Chamber just three months ago, to support the people of that war-torn country who yearn for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">In conclusion, my delegation wishes to pay tribute to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, to the Force Commander and to the men and women of UNAMSIL and to those humanitarian workers who serve in Sierra Leone for their dedication to the cause of peace.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yel'chenko</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">Today's emergency meeting of the Security Council is yet another clear indication of the gravity of the situation in Sierra Leone, underlining the imperative need to take rapid, well-considered, resolute and adequate action in response to the dangerous developments in that African country. Our discussion today has to have a large perspective, not limited exclusively to the situation on the ground. The larger context should underscore the overall credibility and authority of the United Nations and its role in conflict resolution. We hope that the convening of this meeting at the initiative of African States will enable us to take the right decision.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Ukraine is gravely concerned over the current crisis in the peace process in Sierra Leone. We maintain that the responsibility for this lies entirely with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and its leadership. We also strongly condemn the hostile actions, which are absolutely unacceptable, against United Nations peacekeepers. All those responsible should be held accountable for their criminal acts. In its official declaration issued on 6 May, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine demanded the immediate and unharmed release of all detained United Nations personnel. Our delegation strongly reiterates this demand addressed to the Revolutionary United Front.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">Ensuring the safety and security of the peacekeeping personnel in Sierra Leone is of utmost importance. At the same time, another urgent task facing the United Nations is that of preventing the crisis from growing into a new war in that country. Given the current situation on the ground, as well as the real threat of recurrence of large-scale fighting, we strongly believe that it is incumbent on the organ entrusted with the primary responsibility for peace and security to take all appropriate steps at its disposal aimed at bringing the peace process in Sierra Leone back on track.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Our immediate attention should be focused on the following priorities: to free all United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and other international staff detained, to stabilize the situation on the ground and to reinforce United Nations troops.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">We would like to express our high appreciation to the United Kingdom Government for its quick and prompt decision to dispatch a British military contingent in order to secure the strategic Lungi airport.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Today the membership of the United Nations is unanimous in its assessment that political measures alone are likely to fail in bringing about the desirable effect. Against this background, we believe that the Security Council should take tougher measures -- that is, peace enforcement. In this connection, among the conceivable options our strong preference will be the substantial reinforcement of the current UNAMSIL by increasing its combat capabilities. This would require reconsidering the current mandate of UNAMSIL, which has to be brought entirely under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. At the same time, UNAMSIL should be properly equipped as soon as possible so as to be able to act accordingly. All forces to be involved in the operation should perform their functions under the United Nations chain of command.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">With regard to the issue of the revised mandate of UNAMSIL, I would like to recall here one very pertinent recommendation from the Carlsson Inquiry into the United Nations actions during the genocide in Rwanda. This recommendation stated the following:</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">"The overriding concern in formulating mandates must be what presence is needed on the ground, not short-term financial constraints. The Security Council should be presented with proposals reflecting the real needs of a mission, not ones tailored to a previously perceived consensus. Mandates must be robust enough already from the beginning of a mission." (<i><a href="../pdf/S-1999-1257.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/1257</a>, enclosure, p. 56</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">United Nations Member States are looking forward to this kind of proposal from the United Nations Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">We believe that the substantial strengthening of UNAMSIL, even without giving it the task of forcibly disarming the rebels, will demonstrate to the RUF that there will be no option but to lay down its arms and fulfil its obligations under the Lomé Agreement. Furthermore, the strengthening of UNAMSIL would deter rebels from further humiliating actions against peacekeepers.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, I would like to confirm Ukraine's willingness to continue making its own contribution to the United Nations peacemaking efforts in Sierra Leone. In particular, Ukraine has already been involved in providing airlift support for the needs of UNAMSIL.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Levitte</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">It is very good that the Security Council has held this open meeting, upon the request of the African Group, to express strongly the feeling and the solidarity of the entire international community vis-à-vis the crisis in Sierra Leone. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his analysis of the situation and ask him to be so kind as to convey to Mr. Bernard Miyet and the entire Secretariat team our thanks for having mobilized to such an extent during this ordeal. But, first and foremost, our thoughts go out to the men of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) who are still being held hostage. This evening the entire international community must say to all those who are holding them, and especially to Foday Sankoh, "Let them go! Let them do their job! The United Nations will not accept the unacceptable. It will not back down. It has a job to do, and it will do it."</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">Tonight is the time for solidarity. Tonight is the time to say no. The initial operational measures taken by General Jetley show the determination of UNAMSIL to gather itself, to shore itself up, not to shrink from carrying out its mandate. France will support any proposal of the Secretary-General to reinforce UNAMSIL with Blue Helmets that he deems appropriate. It welcomes the speedy intervention of the United Kingdom. It stands ready to think about reviewing the mandate of the force to take into account the unilateral breaking of the Lomé Agreement by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">Tonight Mr. Foday Sankoh and all of the RUF officials must understand that they have no option but to fully respect and implement the Lomé Peace Agreement. France reaffirms its support for the democratically elected authorities of Sierra Leone who are cooperating with the United Nations in an exemplary way. It calls upon the RUF to resume cooperation without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">We must not forget that in Sierra Leone, as well as elsewhere in Africa, the illegal exploitation of natural resources, diamonds in particular, feeds the forces of war. In Sierra Leone, as in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations must react by setting up a monitoring system and by taking strict measures to dry up the financing that enables the RUF to continue its war effort. France calls upon our Council to act decisively in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">Above and beyond the immediate reactions of determination and firmness that we must evince together, our Council must think along with the Secretary-General about longer-term lessons that we should draw from this crisis. The first lesson is that there is no way whatsoever to establish peace if all the parties to a conflict are not resolved to do so. To achieve this objective, and together with any deployment of a force, international pressure at all levels must be maintained on all the actors in the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">The second lesson is that there must be true cohesiveness, a measure of genuine effectiveness, between the mandate of a force and the size, training and equipment of the contingents responsible for implementation. Let us acknowledge today that this was not sufficiently the case for UNAMSIL.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">But in addition to learning those two lessons, we must refrain from hastily confusing different issues. The Sierra Leone crisis inevitably casts a dark shadow on United Nations commitment in Africa. France states firmly that each crisis has its own characteristics. The crisis that gathers us here today must not prevent us from acting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or elsewhere in Africa. That is the conclusion that I can draw without hesitation from the extended mission to the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa from which six other Council members and I have just returned.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">France pays tribute to current efforts by all the African heads of State concerned, including those of Mali, Nigeria, Guinea and Liberia, to bring Foday Sankoh and the other leaders of the RUF to their senses. The entire United Nations stands with Africa to restore peace in Sierra Leone as it does to help the continent overcome each of its crises, fully taking into account their individual characteristics.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">This evening, let us together reaffirm our determination, our solidarity and our commitment, side by side with our African partners, first and foremost with the long-suffering people of Sierra Leone.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jerandi</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, I wish at the outset to thank you for convening this emergency meeting and for your speedy response to the request from the African group that the meeting be held forthwith. We feel certain that this debate will enable us to hear the ideas of many Members of the Organization about how to react most effectively to the dreadful crisis in Sierra Leone, which could at any moment deteriorate further and drift beyond control.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">We are sincerely grateful to the Secretary-General for his intensive efforts and for the important statement he made here this evening.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">I wish also to pay tribute to the soldiers who have given their lives for peace, and to convey the condolences of the Government and the people of Tunisia to the Governments and the families of those who have been killed in so cowardly a way. Further, my Government thanks those who have contributed troops in Sierra Leone, and the troops of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), who continue to face a tense situation.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">Tunisia strongly condemns the actions of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and of its leader, Mr. Foday Sankoh, in deliberate violation of the Lomé Peace Agreement, an agreement they freely signed. These actions must not go unpunished; the amnesty specified in the Peace Agreement must be revisited, given the unacceptable acts perpetrated by the RUF and the unacceptable conduct of its leader, Mr. Sankoh, who has acted against peace and has thus barred his own people from relief from the suffering they have been facing for so long.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">I reiterate my country's full support for the Lomé Agreement, and for United Nations efforts, regional efforts by ECOWAS and international efforts aimed at getting the peace process back on track. In that connection, my delegation fully endorses the conclusions, decisions and recommendations of the summit of ECOWAS heads of State, who met on 9 May at Abuja concerning the Lomé Agreement on Sierra Leone. We believe that these recommendations are an appropriate response to the current crisis, which hangs so heavily over the future of Sierra Leone, and that they merit Security Council support with a view to responding in a manner commensurate with the gravity of the crisis, which could further deteriorate at any moment.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">The Security Council must face up to the situation decisively; it must emerge with its credibility strengthened. The international community must demonstrate even greater solidarity with the Government and the people of Sierra Leone to ensure peace, progress and democracy in that country and to provide the United Nations with the resources needed to discharge its mandate. We must, without further delay, strengthen the mandate of UNAMSIL and reinforce its troops, authorizing the use of ECOWAS troops as soon as possible; the mandate must include a peacemaking dimension. For effective implementation, sufficient equipment and appropriate financial and logistical support must also be given to the peacekeeping force, which would of course be under UNAMSIL command.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">Given the urgency of the situation, it remains crucially important that all detainees be released immediately and unconditionally and that the additional troops made available to UNAMSIL by Bangladesh, India and Jordan be deployed rapidly; Africa thanks those countries most sincerely.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">The crisis in Sierra Leone stirs up sore memories of United Nations experience elsewhere in Africa. We must apply the lessons learned from that experience to the handling of the Sierra Leone crisis. That crisis must also cause us to reflect in depth on peacekeeping and international security in general. We must also consider the human and financial problems raised, along with the question of the correct approach to each operation, to ensure the success of United Nations peacekeeping operations and to prevent harmful setbacks.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">The present situation has brought far too much suffering to the people of Sierra Leone; they expect full support from the international community. The international community must not abandon them.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of China.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">Many other Council members have expressed all of what I would have wanted to say, so I shall try to make my statement as brief as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">The Chinese delegation is deeply concerned at the deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone. We support the efforts of the international community, and in particular of the countries and regional organizations concerned, to defuse the crisis in Sierra Leone. We also convey our appreciation to the Secretariat for its work in that connection. We appeal to the international community to continue to provide a range of emergency assistance to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">Like other delegations, we believe that the Security Council should adopt appropriate measures with respect to the situation in Sierra Leone, including a review of the mandate of UNAMSIL and the adoption of measures to ensure that that mandate is fully implemented. We expect the Secretariat to formulate recommendations in that regard as soon as possible for consideration by the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">The next speaker is the representative of Sierra Leone, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kamara</span> <span class="nation">Sierra Leone</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">My delegation would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the important function of directing the affairs of the Security Council during the month of May. We also congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Fowler of Canada.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">We would also like to thank you and the other members of the Council for the interest which this organ has demonstrated so far in response to the disturbing developments in Sierra Leone over the past several days. We note in particular your two statements to the media, as well as the presidential statement which you made on behalf of the Council last Thursday.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">Every individual, irrespective of nationality, race or creed, has an inalienable right to the safety and security of his or her person. The Government of Sierra Leone, consistent with its constitutional and moral responsibility, has always been concerned with efforts to ensure the safety and security not only of its own citizens, but also of people of other nationalities -- humanitarian workers, peace observers, Secretariat staff and others -- who have left their own homes and families to assist us in one way or another to safeguard the welfare of Sierra Leoneans.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">This is why President Kabbah has conveyed to the Secretary-General and to the heads of State of affected troop contributing countries the sympathy and concern of the Government and people of Sierra Leone for the tragic and criminal acts perpetrated by RUF rebels on the personnel of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). My delegation would like to reiterate our shock and dismay at the sad turn of events and to reassure you, Mr. Secretary-General, and the troop contributors that the Government of Sierra Leone stands ready to provide all necessary assistance to ensure that the UNAMSIL peacekeepers who are still illegally detained by armed rebel elements are released immediately and unharmed. My Government would like to express its gratitude to the Governments of troop contributing countries for their decision to keep their troops in Sierra Leone, notwithstanding these unfortunate incidents. The people of Sierra Leone are indeed grateful.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">Much has been said about the obvious disappointment of the people of Sierra Leone at the events of the past days. Their immediate or initial reaction to those events was not unexpected. It was based on their perception and expectation of the role of UNAMSIL in Sierra Leone. As far as they are concerned, UNAMSIL is in Sierra Leone to replace the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). I need not remind the Council that the average person in Sierra Leone, and in the world at large, does not know the difference between Chapter VI and VII of the United Nations Charter. He or she does not know exactly who in the United Nations, be it the Force Commander on the ground or the Secretary-General, should give UNAMSIL the green light to take appropriate action when elements of RUF rebels decide to take matters into their own hands and resort to violence.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">Much has been said about failures and credibility. Much has also been said about the impact that these latest events in Sierra Leone could have on the future of United Nations peacekeeping in Africa and other parts of the world. We have also heard and read a lot about who should or should not be blamed. It is the view of my Government that it is about time we move ahead. It is about time we move ahead because the situation in Sierra Leone is still serious. It is still a threat to international peace and security. It is a situation that the Security Council must resolutely address as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">Today, we would like to appeal to the Security Council, as the organ primarily responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, to take the lead in ensuring the safety and security of the people of Sierra Leone and those whom the Council deployed to give effect to its mandatory decisions on Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">For their part, the heads of State of the Economic Community of West African States members of the committee on Sierra Leone, in their communiqué issued in Abuja on Tuesday, have, among other things, reaffirmed that UNAMSIL's presence in Sierra Leone is not only in accordance with the Lomé Peace Agreement, but is also supported by the Security Council. Therefore, UNAMSIL must be allowed to freely operate throughout the territory of Sierra Leone without hindrance.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">In this regard, my delegation welcomes current initiatives to strengthen UNAMSIL through the rapid deployment of additional troops. We hope that this process will be expedited in order to avoid any deterioration of a situation which, we are happy to report, continues to improve to the extent that civilians can now go about their business without hindrance. We expect the Council to consider its options and to take appropriate and effective measures -- I emphasize the word "effective" -- to deal with the new situation that has emerged in our country. The Government of Sierra Leone still has faith in the United Nations and in the ability of the Security Council to fulfil its responsibilities under the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">In closing, I would like to quote the following excerpts from the latest official communiqué issued by the Government of Sierra Leone earlier today:</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">"Government wishes to reiterate its continued commitment to the Lomé Peace Agreement, which it views as a key step in the achievement of sustainable peace in Sierra Leone. In the first place, Government is convinced that the people of Sierra Leone and the international community are generally in support of the provisions of the Agreement. Secondly, the continued involvement of the international community in Sierra Leone is contingent upon the implementation of the Lomé Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa12">"While acknowledging that the RUF has seriously violated the provisions of the Agreement, Government still believes that the Agreement is generally implementable. Government is also aware that a large proportion of the members of the RUF were not in support of the abductions of UNAMSIL personnel and the refusal by Foday Sankoh to voluntarily disarm his combatants. They are fed up with war and want the country to move ahead. Government therefore urges all those RUF members interested in sustainable peace in Sierra Leone to take advantage of the amnesty granted them under the Lomé Peace Agreement, and cooperate with Government in the continued implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. Failure to do so will result in the amnesty being forfeited. This will result in their being declared war criminals, with all the consequences flowing from that, including being hunted around the world. This is in line with the position taken in Abuja on 9 May by the ECOWAS heads of State members of the Committee on Sierra Leone of the Lomé Peace Agreement."</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa13">My delegation hopes that the Council will find this statement issued by the Government of Sierra Leone useful in the Council's current deliberations and in considering possible options for immediate action to deal with the situation in our country.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Sierra Leone for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Portugal. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Monteiro</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">First of all, allow me to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this important meeting. I seize this opportunity to wish you success as President of the Security Council for the current month.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">Allow me also to express my solidarity with the intervention just made by the representative of Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland associate themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">As stated immediately after the crisis began, the European Union strongly condemns the attacks and actions taken by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone in direct violation of the Lomé Peace Agreement and is highly concerned by the reports of continuing inadmissible military movements by the RUF.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">We firmly condemn the reported killing of personnel of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and continue to be deeply disturbed by the totally unacceptable detention of hundreds of its military and civilian personnel. The European Union deplores the fact that the ongoing crisis brought more suffering to the already beleaguered civilian population. The European Union believes that all those responsible for these actions should be made accountable.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">The European Union calls on the Revolutionary United Front, and in particular Foday Sankoh, who as its leader has major responsibilities in the ongoing deplorable crisis, to cease immediately all attacks, to release all detainees safely and unconditionally and to recommit themselves to the full implementation of the Lomé Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">The European Union welcomes the Secretary-General's mission to Sierra Leone, headed by Under-Secretary-General Bernard Miyet, to assess the situation in the field. It fully appreciates and supports the efforts being undertaken by the United Nations to solve the current crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">The European Union believes that UNAMSIL is facing a serious emergency and strongly encourages all States in a position to do so to assist and provide the means deemed necessary for the accomplishment of its mandate. The European Union notes that UNAMSIL has authority, under Chapter VII of the Charter, to use force to ensure the security and freedom of movement of its personnel and to protect civilians, where possible.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">In this context, the European Union pays tribute to all troop contributors and welcomes and supports efforts already made to speed up the deployment of the remaining three battalions from India, Jordan and Bangladesh, which will join the UNAMSIL peacekeeping contingent. We welcome the efforts made by those countries offering logistical assistance to this operation. The European Union stresses that one of its member States, the United Kingdom, as recognized by previous speakers, has made an important military contribution, particularly at Lungi Airport.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">The United Nations is again facing a major challenge in Africa and should not fail. Firm and sustained action by UNAMSIL and the international community as a whole is needed to bring the peace process back on track.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">The European Union reiterates that the active engagement of regional leaders is especially critical to bring this crisis to an end and restore stability in Sierra Leone. In this regard we welcomed the summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) heads of States in Abuja on 9 May, which reaffirmed total ECOWAS support to restore peace in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa12">Finally, let me echo the words of the Secretary-General here tonight. In this crisis, let us back words with deeds, and mandates with resources needed to make them work.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Norway. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Brattskar</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">The deeply troubling turn of events in Sierra Leone warrants urgent attention and requires the best efforts of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">Norway condemns in the strongest terms the detention of the personnel of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and calls for their immediate, safe and unconditional release. Those responsible for these actions, including RUF leader Foday Sankoh, must be held accountable.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">A Norwegian military observer, Commander Gjellestad, is held captive somewhere in Sierra Leone, with no confirmed reports on his whereabouts or health. We are deeply concerned about his fate, as well as that of other detainees, United Nations personnel and that of the people of Sierra Leone, who has suffered so much in recent years. The United Nations should have as its highest priority to obtain the release of the detainees held by the RUF. We therefore welcome the establishment of a special team within the UNAMSIL headquarters, working towards this end.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">Norway supports the efforts by the United Nations and UNAMSIL to restore peace in Sierra Leone and to fulfil the mission's mandate, including the protection of civilians. We also express our support for the regional and international efforts under way to resolve the crisis, including those by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Norway is considering ways to support the United Nations in addressing the difficult problems ahead, and we urge others to extend all possible support to the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">Norway deplores the blatant violations of the Lomé Peace Agreement by the RUF and calls upon its leadership to implement the provisions of this agreement in full, including cooperation in implementing the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">Lessons from other conflicts have taught us the importance of rebuilding viable administrative structures and civil society, with the support of the international community, in order to move from an initial cease-fire to sustainable peace. Norway has contributed to this in Sierra Leone through the support of several initiatives, such as the DDR programme. Altogether, we have pledged or allocated some $5 million to projects in Sierra Leone for the current fiscal year. In the present situation, the future of these projects is uncertain, and we have been forced to withdraw all our civilian personnel in charge of humanitarian aid from Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">In the search for a long-term solution to this conflict, high priority should be given to curbing arms supplies and the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons. These weapons undermine the security of civilians and threaten the safety of international peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel. The present situation highlights the importance of initiatives such as the moratorium on small arms in West Africa, an initiative Norway has actively supported. In a similar vein, we underscore the importance of regulating sources of income that fuel civil strife in Africa, such as the trade in diamonds and other precious minerals.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">Norway remains firmly committed to peace and development in Africa. These past months we have seen how the work to build peace and a better future for women, children and men in many parts of the continent has been reversed by armed conflict and unrest. At this critical juncture, the international community must not turn its back on Africa, but redouble its support for the efforts to ensure sustainable peace and development on the continent.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of India. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sharma</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa01">Thank you, Mr. President, for calling this open meeting on the crisis in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa02">The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was set up on the assumption that all parties to the conflict in Sierra Leone had at last decided to resolve their differences peacefully through the Lomé Peace Agreement, which they had all freely accepted. UNAMSIL was despatched to help implement the Agreement through its impartial and reassuring presence and by taking charge of the process of voluntary demobilization and disarmament, which was absolutely essential to pave the way for a lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa03">It now appears from recent events that the leadership of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) had no intentions of honouring their commitments under the Agreement. The tensions, which, from the actions of their cadres, started to build up from late last month, have now erupted into a full-scale crisis, whose immediate brunt is being borne by the people of Sierra Leone and UNAMSIL's peacekeepers, but which will have far wider repercussions.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa04">The leaders of the region have individually and collectively denounced these actions of the RUF and of their leader, Mr. Foday Sankoh. Unfortunately, that has had no visible effect so far. There are unconfirmed reports that Mr. Sankoh may have received sanctuary. If so, we trust that those to whom he is beholden, or who have influence upon him, will also persuade him to call off immediately the military action that he has started, to release the UNAMSIL personnel he has taken hostage and to commit himself again to the Lomé Agreement. We expect the Security Council to pronounce itself forcefully on this matter, making it clear to the leadership of the RUF that the international community is united in its condemnation of their actions.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa05">What then? There are two options that seem to be the obvious ones, which have been spoken about in the corridors and mooted in the media, but which we would strongly advise against. The first is to wind down and withdraw. UNAMSIL was sent to Sierra Leone to keep a peace that has unravelled, and it could be argued that if the people of Sierra Leone do not want peace, the United Nations can hardly impose it upon them. That, of course, would be terribly unfair to the people of Sierra Leone, who are the victims of this violence, not its cause. In Rwanda in 1994, in a comparable crisis, when peacekeepers came under threat, the United Nations decided to abandon the operation, with consequences that no one would wish to see repeated.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa06">Certainly, even though India has troops on the ground, we have no intention of pulling out, and we very strongly urge the Council not to consider this as an option. We are in fact sending a second battalion urgently, together with other reinforcements, to bolster UNAMSIL's strength.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa07">The second option, which might seem logical if the first is rejected, is to change UNAMSIL's mandate immediately into peace enforcement, under a Chapter VII operation. However, we would like the Council to bear in mind that UNAMSIL presently does not have the troops, the equipment or the logistics needed to mount a peace-enforcement operation. Giving UNAMSIL a mandate it cannot implement will not help it; it might even compound its difficulties in two ways. On the ground, if the RUF goes on an all-out offensive in retaliation, UNAMSIL, and particularly the hostages, might suffer heavy and needless casualties. Politically, critics of the United Nations will argue that even with a Chapter VII mandate the United Nations has been able to do nothing.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa08">Therefore, we would say that the question of a change in UNAMSIL's mandate is one that the Council may wish to keep under review, in the light of developments. In this event, we expect that troop contributors will be associated in the Council's decision-making process, in the spirit of Article 44 of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa09">There are some who believe that the United Nations cannot do what needs to be done now in Sierra Leone and that force should be deployed and used by others, with the blessings of the Security Council. As long as UNAMSIL is in place, we cannot warn too strongly against this. Somalia showed us the dangers inherent in forces outside United Nations command taking military action in a theatre where peacekeepers are deployed. Both the backlash and the blame for failure fall on the United Nations and its Blue Helmets.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa10">In the current crisis, it is essential to preserve the unity of command of UNAMSIL, and it must function as a cohesive force. Undermining the leadership of UNAMSIL is fraught with dangerous consequences for the Mission as a whole and of the troops under its command.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa11">In our opinion, UNAMSIL needs to consolidate. In present circumstances, it clearly cannot implement many of the tasks given to it. Little in the way of humanitarian assistance is being provided; the providers have left. Nor can UNAMSIL keep thoroughfares open when it is itself under siege. It is spread out all over the country, showing the United Nations flag, but this also means that its soldiers are dispersed in penny packets, trying to do a job that presently cannot be done.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa12">With the professional and well-equipped reinforcements that are coming in, UNAMSIL must concentrate on measures that would make it impossible for power, or the institutions of government in Freetown, to be seized by force. It already has a Chapter VII mandate to provide security at key locations and Government buildings and to use force in self-defence. The rules of engagement are clear. If all units in UNAMSIL act with discipline and courage in accordance with the mandate that they already have, they will be able to serve the United Nations and the people of Sierra Leone well.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa13">In conclusion, I wish to reiterate, that, as we have always done in other difficult peacekeeping operations in which we have participated, India will stay the course. I will share with members of the Council the fact that this decision has not been easy to take. It is not an easy matter to answer the question why the lives of Indian soldiers should be put at risk in an operation that currently has some serious weaknesses and imponderables. To the question, what interests are we defending in Sierra Leone, we have said that we are there, and must stay there, for two reasons. First, because to leave now would be to abandon the people of Sierra Leone to a terrible fate, and secondly, because the credibility of the United Nations is at stake. We believe those are also the two considerations uppermost on the Council's mind.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Satoh</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">Japan has requested this opportunity to participate in this meeting because of its deep concern over the deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone. My delegation joins the previous speakers in condemning the violence by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), particularly its brutal attacks against unarmed civilians and United Nations peacekeepers. We demand that the RUF stop its hostile actions and that it release unharmed the hundreds of peacekeepers it has taken hostage.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">The danger that the hostilities could escalate once again into a full-blown civil war is very real. Japan's concern is further compounded by the fact that the situation in Sierra Leone could have grave implications for the future of United Nations peacekeeping operations as a whole, and particularly for those in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">It is therefore imperative that the international community respond quickly and effectively. The actions it takes must be determined by decisions of the Security Council, as prescribed by the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">Whether to expand the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone to include the task of peace enforcement by incorporating the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) into the United Nations mission, or whether to entrust peace enforcement to ECOMOG itself, is for the Council to decide. What is most important is for the Security Council to respond promptly, before the situation deteriorates further.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">I can assure you, Mr. President, that Japan will continue to support the decisions of the Security Council on this issue.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa01">I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open meeting on the crisis in Sierra Leone. I am taking the floor in my capacity as Coordinator of the Eastern Africa subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa02">Ostensibly, we are here today to urgently consider the abrupt and shocking deterioration of the peacekeeping effort in Sierra Leone. It is stunning to witness the blatant attacks on peacekeepers and the capture of hundreds of them and even to hear about the unconfirmed deaths of a few. We express our deep sympathies to those families and countries that have lost peacekeepers and to those who are still looking for certain of their loved ones, whether they are detained or cannot be accounted for. We are, indeed, at the juncture of what I believe will be one of the most important decisions of our age for the international community. The standoff in Sierra Leone represents an all too familiar test of wills between the United Nations and yet another warlord. It remains to be seen whether the United Nations will be able to contain the actions of rebels who seem determined to unravel any peace agreement that they have accepted. Given the recent increase in peacekeeping commitments to Africa by the United Nations, the outcome will have significant meaning for Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa03">The peace pact in Sierra Leone must rest not only on good intentions and trust but also on force. Sierra Leone is in serious danger of being mired in violence again, with the looming possibility that it will turn into another Somalia, a State that for a decade now has been run by bands of warlords. We cannot abandon Sierra Leone; to do so would not only send the wrong signal to Africa but would be untenable and, indeed, unacceptable to the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa04">Later this year, the world will observe a Millennium Summit held here at the United Nations, where we will explore the themes of peace and security, including disarmament, development, poverty eradication, human rights and the strengthening of the United Nations. In Sierra Leone, elements of each of these issues are in play and, to an enormous extent, the manner in which we as an international community resolve these immediate issues in that wretched and frightening place will define the relevance of these issues for a large segment of humanity.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa05">In many respects, we might almost set our computers to substitute, in each sentence, the word "Africa" for "Sierra Leone", for it is unlikely that we will be prepared to do much more anywhere on the continent than in that country. For a myriad of reasons, Africa is currently plagued by an infestation of criminal-minded warlords, rogues for whom peace, human rights and lawful government are viewed as illogical obstructions to their self-interest.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa06">This is clearly the case in Sierra Leone, Angola and Somalia -- and the list goes on. For nearly a decade, the rebels have adopted a strategy of cruelty to frighten the country into submission. With its limited resources, the Government of Sierra Leone, at the behest of other influential parties, has had little choice but to agree to a peace accord. Despite years of crimes against humanity, a legacy of atrocities that will characterize Sierra Leone in the minds of the rest of the world for ages, and the virtual destruction of the country's youth, the rebels were absolved of punishment, given key ministerial posts in the Government and a lifestyle which they could never before have imagined. The only trade-off expected of the rebels was that they would abide by the terms of the peace accord and disarm, under the supervision of United Nations peacekeepers. Unfortunately, these peacekeepers lack the right mandate and are lightly armed, ill-equipped, poorly coordinated and outmanned -- a reflection of an attempt at peacekeeping on the cheap that is tragically laughable when set against the mammoth efforts in power, arms and resources seen in Kosovo, East Timor or Bosnia. In hindsight, it was clearly a mistake to agree to such an accord and to attempt to appease the rebels at such a cost. But what, it must be asked, was the alternative? Sadly, it was not the first capitulation to warlords in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa07">This is, in many respects, the situation we have seen in Somalia. With its own decade of destruction at the hands of its warlords, Somalia has not had a Government for a long time. Yet now, when an overwhelming national consensus is emerging, and when the vast majority of Somalis have united for peace, the warlords continue to obstruct peace and deny the country the peace and development it so obviously craves and needs. There is now a promising peace conference on Somalia under way in Djibouti, yet somehow the warlords are tolerated while they continue making noises against this clear progress and are being supported in their endeavours by a nefarious few. The international community must warn these warlords that they must accept the peace which Somali civil society clearly desires, or else face the consequences, and it must take to task those who continue to assist them in their unending adventures. Here again, their ill-gotten economic gain in a lawless environment no doubt exceeds what they perceive as being possible in a stable situation. That is why, for them, the lawless environment has to be made much worse than the prospects of a peaceful one.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa08">As in Somalia, Angola, the Congo and elsewhere in Africa, we are thus at a crossroad in terms of how we, as an international community, are to respond in Sierra Leone. To his credit, the Secretary-General has waged a long campaign to re-engage the international community in Africa's conflicts in the Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We all know how agonizing this setback in Sierra Leone is to him. He is right: Africa must not be marginalized and left on its own to solve its problems without outside assistance. Sierra Leone is therefore a signal of the level of international concern for peace and security, including disarmament, in Africa. As is the case throughout the continent, the eagerness to monopolize the diamond trade stands in stark contrast to the pervasive poverty in the country and its lack of development.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa09">Africa is prepared to undertake a regional response to this crisis in Sierra Leone, but, as all Council members know, it lacks the resources to complete the task. At the same time, as all members know, rebel units there have the advantage of controlling the lucrative diamond mines through which they are able to finance their hostilities. As I said earlier, Sierra Leone is not alone in its difficulties with hostile rebel groups, which require an effective response to end the nightmare of suffering that the common people of that hapless country have endured.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa10">Finally, we must try to make the arms embargo more effective and also promote regional peacemaking. In the absence of Africa's imposing overwhelming strength on its rebel forces that oppose democratic governance, it must rely upon collective security, as enshrined in the Charter, to bring about lasting peace.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ahmad</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">May I, too, begin by thanking you, Sir, for presiding over this open debate on the developments in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa02">I would like to join other speakers in expressing our deepest condolences to the families of four Kenyan soldiers who lost their lives in the line of duty. Our sympathies are also with those peacekeepers who are being held hostage by the forces of the Revolutionary United Front Party (RUF). One of them belongs to Pakistan.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa03">We note with appreciation the courage and commitment demonstrated by the peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, particularly those still held hostage. The RUF must release the hostages immediately and unconditionally.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa04">We are extremely disturbed at the unfortunate turn of events in Sierra Leone, raising questions as to the effectiveness of the peace efforts of the United Nations and the determination of the international community. There is a need to demonstrate wisdom and commitment in dealing with the evolving situation. The only recourse to a viable peace is to implement the Peace Agreement signed in Lomé on 7 July 1999. The international community supported the peace process in Sierra Leone, as reflected in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1289(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1289 (2000)</a> of 7 February this year.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa05">It is our understanding that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1289(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1289 (2000)</a> clearly describes the ways and means of dealing with the challenges of the type and magnitude that have now emerged in Freetown and in other parts of the country. Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, in paragraph 10 of the resolution the Security Council authorized the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to undertake some additional tasks in the light of conditions on the ground, including, first, to provide security at key locations; secondly, to facilitate the free flow of people, goods and humanitarian assistance; and thirdly, to guard weapons and military equipment collected from ex-combatants. In the discharge of these tasks, the peacekeepers were mandated to take the necessary action to ensure the security and freedom of movement of UNAMSIL personnel and, within its capabilities and areas of deployment, to afford protection to civilians under imminent threat of physical violence.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa06">The question now arises as to whether UNAMSIL took the necessary measures to ensure the security and freedom of movement of its personnel or to afford protection to civilians under imminent threat. The answer is in the negative. It seems that, while an adequate mandate has been given to the Mission to address such situations as hostage-taking, the peacekeepers deployed on the ground are not adequately equipped to act as per the mandate. There has to be a balance and linkage between the mandate, composition of forces and operational posture adopted in the field. We could not possibly expect the lightly armed infantry battalions deployed in Sierra Leone to implement such robust mandates while maintaining the right posture. The Secretariat needs to assess what went wrong in the planning and deployment of peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, including the configuration of the force. It is all the more important to ensure that, in future, the security component of a peacekeeping mission serve as an asset rather than become a liability.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa07">While urging proper review and corrective measures by the Security Council and the Secretariat with a view to making the peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone operational again, we would like to emphasize the need to avoid repeating similar mistakes in other missions, including the one in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pakistan has committed one battalion group for the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We would like to see a practical concept of operation and configuration of force there in a manner that is capable of supporting the implementation of the mandate of the Mission and such that its success does not depend only on the declared intentions of the parties involved in the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa08">Pakistan has always emphasized the point that the international community's commitment to the promotion of peace in Africa will be judged by its seriousness in translating rhetoric into reality. We should not be found wanting in generating the necessary political will to turn words into deeds.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa09">The time has come to reiterate our collective commitment to peace efforts in Africa. We cannot allow the peace process in Sierra Leone to fail, despite invoking Chapter VII elements in the mandate of the Security Council. There cannot be different types of Chapter VII missions in different regions. If Chapter VII missions in other regions have successfully helped to establish peace, that has to be the case in Sierra Leone as well.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my country's commitment to the peace, security and prosperity of the continent of Africa.</p>

	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, I would like to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month and on the wisdom and skill you have demonstrated in conducting the affairs of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa02">The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, under the leadership of His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al-Hussein, is committed to the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1270(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 1270 (1999)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1289(2000).pdf" class="pdf">1289 (2000)</a>. While the situation in Sierra Leone remains critical, we believe that the position of the United Nations will improve in the near future. We are now in the process of reinforcing the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) by committing two extra companies drawn from Jordan's special forces, and we will be sending another battalion within a few days.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa03">We do not feel it is wise for the Council to consider new initiatives while we are deploying our troops. A reconsideration of the UNAMSIL mandate now may well lead to an absence of agreement between the troop contributors. In our opinion, this would weaken the United Nations position in Sierra Leone. We believe the present mandate should for the time being remain the way it is, under Chapter VII of the Charter, until the situation in Sierra Leone stabilizes. Here we support what was said by the representative of India.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa04">The Revolutionary United Front (RUF), under Mr. Sankoh, must heed the condemnation of the Security Council and the international community; Mr. Sankoh's troops must not take further hostile action; rather, they must abide by the terms of the Lomé Agreement and Security Council resolutions, and they must give up their weapons immediately so the people of Sierra Leone can have the peace they so richly deserve.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa05">Finally, we would like to express our sincere condolences to the families of those United Nations personnel who lost their lives while fulfilling their duties.</p>

	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">I think that today's open meeting has been very helpful. We have heard a wide range of views of United Nations Members, in particular of the African Members, on the situation in Sierra Leone. Undoubtedly, many ideas and suggestions expressed during the meeting will contribute to the Security Council's consideration of the situation in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">The Security Council will remain closely seized of the matter and will further discuss the subject as required.</p>
