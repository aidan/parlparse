	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1995-707.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/707</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 17 August 1995 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1995-710.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/710</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 18 August 1995 from the Chargé d'affaires <i>ad interim </i>of the Permanent Mission of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council is deeply concerned by the contents of the Secretary-General's letter of 17 August 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-707.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/707</a>) regarding the continued impediments to the functioning and deployment of the Rapid Reaction Force (RRF) established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-998(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 998 (1995)</a> of 16 June 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Council reaffirms in this regard that the RRF is an integral part of UNPF/UNPROFOR and that its deployment is crucial for the strengthening of UNPROFOR's capacity to carry out its mandate in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It shares the Secretary-General's view that the existing status of forces agreements constitute an appropriate and sufficient basis for the presence of UNPF/UNPROFOR, including the RRF.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council is deeply concerned at the implications of the continued impediments to the functioning of the RRF for the effectiveness of the United Nations mission in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It calls upon the Government of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina immediately to remove all impediments and to give clear undertakings concerning the freedom of movement and provision of facilities for the RRF, in order that it may perform its tasks without further delay. It further calls upon them to resolve forthwith within the framework of the existing SOFAs any outstanding difficulties with the relevant United Nations authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council supports fully the efforts of the Secretary-General in this matter and will return to this question in the light of a further report which the Security Council requests the Secretary-General to submit no later than 24 August 1995."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-40.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/40</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
