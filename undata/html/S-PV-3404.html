	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the fifth progress report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, <a href="../pdf/S-1994-760.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/760</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on Liberia dated 24 June 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-760.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/760</a>). On the basis of this report, as well as the oral briefing provided by the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Liberia, the Council has carried out a review of the situation in Liberia, including the role played by the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) as called for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-911(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 911 (1994)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;In this context, the Council notes that, since the interim review in May 1994, there has been limited progress in the peace process and that the Liberian National Transitional Government (LNTG) has been unable to extend its authority effectively outside the Monrovia area. The Council notes further with concern that preparations for national elections have been hampered by the continued fighting and the consequent virtual halt of the disarmament process. It underscores that until the disarmament process is substantially accomplished the holding of free and fair elections will not be possible. It reiterates, nevertheless, the need to make urgent preparations to enable the timely holding of free and fair elections. To this end, a substantial acceleration of the disarmament process is essential. It notes that continued delay may have an adverse effect on international participation in the Liberian peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Council therefore calls on the LNTG, in cooperation with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Organization of African Unity, with the support of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and UNOMIL as necessary, to convene a meeting of the Liberian factions concerned to address the problems affecting disarmament. The Council considers that the objectives of such a meeting should be to agree on a realistic plan to resume disarmament and to set a target date for its completion. The Council calls on the LNTG to convene the meeting as soon as possible, at the latest by 31 July 1994. The Council stresses the importance it places on the Liberian factions concerned attending such a meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Council further calls upon all factions in Liberia to demonstrate the resolve and commitment necessary to achieve national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Council expresses its concern about the increase in military activities being carried out in violation of the general cease-fire and the consequent large-scale displacement of persons and atrocities which have been committed throughout the country. The Council condemns all those who initiate fighting and who violate international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Council strongly deplores attacks on and the abduction and harassment of United Nations and ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) personnel in Liberia, as well as looting of United Nations and ECOMOG property. It demands that such hostile acts cease forthwith.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;The Council urges the Liberian parties to take all necessary measures to ensure the security and safety of UNOMIL and ECOMOG personnel, as well as of the personnel involved in relief operations, and strictly to abide by the applicable rules of international humanitarian law. It demands that all factions in Liberia extend full cooperation to organizations engaged in the delivery of humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">&quot;The Council commends the positive role of ECOWAS in its continued efforts to facilitate peace and security in Liberia, including through the provision of ECOMOG troops. It welcomes the continued close cooperation between ECOMOG and UNOMIL.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">&quot;The Council also commends other African States that have provided troops to ECOMOG and those Member States that have contributed to the trust fund established pursuant to paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-866(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 866 (1993)</a> or provided other assistance in support of the troops. However, the Council expresses its concern that sufficient financial and other support for the ECOMOG troops has not yet been forthcoming despite the importance of their continued presence in the Liberian peace process. The Council calls on all Member States urgently to consider providing financial or material support either through the United Nations trust fund or on a bilateral basis to enable ECOMOG to fulfil its responsibilities in accordance with the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">&quot;The Council commends the Secretary-General for the priority given to reporting on violations of international humanitarian law and other atrocities and encourages continued attention to these aspects of the situation in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">&quot;The Council requests the Secretary-General to ensure that all information on cease-fire and arms embargo violations obtained by UNOMIL, in pursuit of its mandate, is made promptly available to the Security Council and publicized more widely as appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">&quot;The Council expresses concern at problems encountered by the LNTG in extending its authority outside the Monrovia area, and requests the Secretary-General to explore, in consultation with ECOWAS, whether there are any steps which might be taken to facilitate LNTG's efforts in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">&quot;The Council urges ECOWAS to continue its efforts to help the Liberian parties make substantial progress towards a political settlement in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">&quot;The Council requests the Secretary-General to report on the situation in Liberia by 2 September 1994 and to consider in that report whether the meeting on disarmament has resulted in a realistic plan for disarmament and whether implementation of such a plan has begun. The report should also provide options for the size and mandate of UNOMIL that reflect the outcome of the meeting and the progress in implementing the disarmament plan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">&quot;The Council will remain actively seized of the matter.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa19">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-33.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/33</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa20">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
