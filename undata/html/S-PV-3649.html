	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council expresses its grave concern at the outbreak of fighting in Monrovia and the rapidly deteriorating situation throughout Liberia. This new outbreak of factional fighting, the harassment and abuse of the civilian population and humanitarian and relief workers, threatens the peace process and raises serious doubts about the commitment of the factions to its implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council reminds all parties of their responsibility fully to respect international humanitarian law with regard to the civilian population and to ensure the safety of United Nations and other international personnel, and calls upon them to take immediate steps to this end. The Council calls on all parties to fulfil their obligation to respect the inviolability of diplomatic personnel and property.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the failure of the Council of State and the faction leaders to demonstrate the political will and determination required for implementation of the Abuja Agreement. Unless Liberia's political leaders immediately show by concrete positive actions a reaffirmation of their commitment to the Abuja Agreement and fully honour their obligation to re-establish and maintain the cease-fire, they risk losing the support of the international community. The Council underscores the personal responsibility of Liberia's leaders in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms its support for the Abuja Agreement as the only existing framework for resolving Liberia's political crisis and the crucial role of the Economic Community of West African States in bringing the conflict to an end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council calls on the Liberian National Transitional Government and the Liberian parties to work with the West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) immediately to disengage all forces, re-establish peace and law and order in Monrovia and an effective and comprehensive cease-fire throughout the country. The Council calls on the parties, in particular ULIMO-J, to release all hostages without harm. It further calls upon the parties to return all captured weapons and equipment to ECOMOG.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council reminds all States of their obligation to comply strictly with the embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Liberia imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-788(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 788 (1992)</a> and to bring all instances of violations of the arms embargo before the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-985(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 985 (1995)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council declares its intention, based on the progress made by the Liberian parties in implementing the steps set out above, and after consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on developments in Liberia, to determine what further measures may be appropriate regarding the future United Nations presence in Liberia."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1996-16.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1996/16</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
