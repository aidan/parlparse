Deng Xiaoping will be remembered by the international community for his dedicated contribution to global peace, security and development, and for his role as the primary architect of China's reforms, its opening up, modernization and unprecedented economic development. His passing is a great loss to China and to the international community.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">On this occasion of profound grief for the Chinese people, Portugal sincerely regrets the death of China's Paramount Leader, Mr. Deng Xiaoping, a central and historic figure in the construction of modern China.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Mr. Deng Xiaoping was instrumental in the deepening of relations between China and Portugal. It was under his able leadership that China and Portugal initiated the ongoing negotiations for the hand-over of the administration of the Territory of Macao in 1999. His constructive and cooperative spirit is clearly reflected in the smooth progress of those negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">The President of the Republic of Portugal, who is currently in China on a state visit, was able to express personally to China and its people the heartfelt condolences of Portugal and its people on the passing of Mr. Deng Xiaoping.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">It was with profound sadness that we learned of the passing away of His Excellency Mr. Deng Xiaoping. With his passing, the People's Republic of China has lost a wise and visionary leader.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">It was His Excellency Mr. Deng Xiaoping who, with great courage and foresight, crafted and vigorously implemented China's modernization policies of reform and openness. His Excellency Mr. Deng Xiaoping attached great importance to developing ties and promoting mutual understanding between our two countries, beginning with the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">He honoured Japan with visits in 1978 and again in 1979, and in turn welcomed to China many Japanese people from diverse sectors for close and wide-ranging discussions. Indeed, the friendly and cooperative relations which our two countries enjoy today are in no small measure the legacy of this great man.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">On behalf of the Government and people of Japan, I should like on this occasion to convey to His Excellency Mr. Qin Huasun and the members of his Mission -- and through him to the Government and people of the People's Republic of China -- my sincere condolences at this time of bereavement.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Deng Xiaoping was in the leadership of China for half a century and personally led that country for the past 18 years. He also helped to develop policies and reforms for the modernization of China that have allowed the country to achieve important progress. He has left an indelible mark on the economic, political and social life of his country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">China and the entire world will always remember with appreciation and gratitude the many years of wise leadership of the great leader Mr. Deng Xiaoping.</p>

His recognized political stature gives him a special place among the world leaders of this century.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">On behalf of the Government of Chile, I wish to convey to the Government and the people of the People's Republic of China, through the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations, our sincerest condolences at this enormous loss.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">On behalf of Her Majesty's Government, I wish to express our regret on learning of the recent death of Mr. Deng Xiaoping. He played a historic role in the development of modern China, most recently through the economic reform programme and China's greater opening to the outside world. With his visionary concept of "one country, two systems", he made a major contribution to the conclusion by the United Kingdom and China of the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong in 1984.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">We offer our condolences to Mr. Deng's family and to the people of China.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Richardson</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">As President Clinton recently stated, Deng Xiaoping was an extraordinary figure on the world stage. Mr. Deng spurred China's historic economic reform programme and opened his country to the outside world. His historic visit to our country in 1979 laid the foundation for the rapid exchange of relations and cooperation between China and the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">On behalf of the United States Government and the people of the United States, we offer our condolences to his family and to the Chinese people. He will be sorely missed.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">On behalf of the Republic of Korea, the Korean delegation also expresses its profound condolences to the Government and the people of China on the passing away of their Paramount Leader, Mr. Deng Xiaoping. Mr. Deng left an indelible mark on the history of mankind, as he did so much to improve the well-being of so many people in such a short period of time. In that way he made an indispensable contribution to the peace and prosperity not only of China but also of the entire East Asian region and beyond.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">We are convinced that the policies of openness and reform which he initiated set China on the path to prosperity. It is our sincere hope that the Chinese people and leadership will be able to overcome the sorrow and grief that engulf them at the loss of their great leader, and will continue to march forward on the road that Mr. Deng Xiaoping pioneered.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">We learned with great sorrow of the death of Mr. Deng Xiaoping. He will remain in all of our memories as a great figure in the history of China. I recall that France welcomed him on its soil, along with other future leaders of China, in the early 1920s. He will go down in history as the major craftsman of the changes that the People's Republic of China has experienced over the past 20 years.</p>

Mr. Deng Xiaoping's extraordinary leadership led to a remarkable period of change and reform that brought well-being and an enormous improvement in the standard of living of the people of China. A few years before the end of the century, China is now one of the essential protagonists in the coming world of the twenty-first century.

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Qin Huasun</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa01">Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who was deeply loved by Chinese people of all ethnic groups, passed away in Beijing on 19 February 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa02">Mr. Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader whose high prestige was acknowledged by the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Chinese people of all ethnic groups. He was the chief architect of China's reforms, opening up and modernization, and the founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa03">Mr. Deng Xiaoping devoted his entire life to the liberation and development of the Chinese nation and made indelible contributions to China's national independence, the liberation of its people and the founding of a New China.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa04">Mr. Deng Xiaoping had made significant contributions at all stages of development since the founding of the People's Republic of China. He drafted a new blueprint for China's development by drawing on others' experience and breaking with outmoded conventions in the light of the developments in today's world and China's actual conditions. This has brought profound changes to China, from the countryside to cities and from coastal special economic zones to inland areas, with the economy booming and people living and working in peace and contentment. Mr. Deng Xiaoping also creatively proposed the concept of "one country, two systems", providing a fundamental guarantee for the gradual accomplishment of the cause of China's reunification.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa05">Mr. Deng Xiaoping's life was a great and glorious one. He made historic contributions to charting a course for development that was suited to China's national conditions, creating and developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, carrying out reforms, opening up and achieving modernization, accomplishing the cause of national reunification, opening up a new situation in China's relations with foreign countries, and developing and strengthening China's friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He proved himself to be a great son of the Chinese people. He deeply loved his motherland and people and was deeply loved and respected by the Chinese people. The passing of Mr. Deng Xiaoping is an immeasurable loss to Chinese people of all ethnic groups.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa06">The collective leadership, with President Jiang Zemin at its core, will lead the Chinese people in carrying forward the legacy of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, advancing the great cause he pioneered: building China into a prosperous, democratic and civilized socialist country and developing friendly relations of cooperation with all countries in the world, thus making more and greater contributions to peace, development and the progress of mankind.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa07">At today's Council meeting, the President of the Council and other Council members expressed their condolences to the Chinese delegation on the passing of Mr. Deng Xiaoping. I wish on this occasion to express, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, my heartfelt thanks to the President and to other Council members. I will convey these condolences and sincere sentiments to the Chinese Government, the Chinese people and the family of Mr. Deng Xiaoping.</p>
