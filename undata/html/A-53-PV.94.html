	<div class="p">In accordance with General Assembly decision 42/450 of 17 December 1987, the Assembly elects the members of the Committee for Programme and Coordination upon their nomination by the Economic and Social Council.</div>
	<div class="p">Members will recall that at its 43rd meeting, held on 26 October 1998, the General Assembly elected six members to the Committee, and there remained one vacancy from among the Western European and other States from a previous session, as well as one vacancy from among the African States for a term of office beginning on the date of election and expiring on 31 December 2001.</div>

	<div class="p">As indicated in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-440-Add.1">A/53/440/Add.1</a>, the Economic and Social Council has nominated the Comoros to fill the vacancy remaining from among the African States.</div>

	Mr. Insanally (Guyana)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I would like to express, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, our sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the nomination of Mr. Rubens Ricupero for a second term as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The Secretary-General's expression of confidence in Mr. Ricupero is fully shared by the Group of 77 and China. We therefore take this opportunity to extend to him our warm congratulations and best wishes for another successful term.</div>
	<div class="p">Since Mr. Ricupero's appointment as Secretary-General of UNCTAD in 1995, we have witnessed a major transformation of UNCTAD. His intellectual leadership, vision and commitment to development have been critical to the re-emergence of UNCTAD as a serious, competent and responsible organization providing a balanced treatment of a wide range of interrelated issues in development in an increasingly interdependent and globalizing world. Today more than ever before, UNCTAD is needed as a forum for the dialogue on development and the related issues of trade, finance, technology, investment and sustainable development.</div>
	<div class="p">UNCTAD's high-quality analyses of major developments in the world economy, and particularly of salient issues and concerns facing the developing countries, have been very helpful to our preparations in these major areas. Within the United Nations, UNCTAD has also been responsive to the need for reform, and this has not only led to greater efficiency in the intergovernmental and secretariat machinery of the organization, but has also enabled UNCTAD to more closely collaborate with civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the business community. Despite these gains, however, the level of resources allocated to UNCTAD has been significantly reduced in recent times. We therefore urge greater support for its activities.</div>
	<div class="p">As we look forward to and plan for UNCTAD X, our Group hopes that the Conference will provide an important opportunity for the United Nations system and the international community to collectively reflect on development in the context of globalization. Out of it should come strategies and policies to ensure the successful integration of all countries, particularly developing countries, into the world economy. We therefore trust that under the continuing guidance and leadership of Mr. Ricupero, UNCTAD will effectively respond to these challenges.</div>

	Mr. Powles (New Zealand)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have the honour to speak on behalf of Australia, Canada, Japan, the United States and New Zealand. On the occasion of the reappointment of Mr. Ricupero as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), we would like to express our full support for UNCTAD as the focal point for the integrated treatment of development and related issues within the United Nations as called for in Midrand, South Africa, in 1996.</div>
	<div class="p">In the Midrand Declaration, Member States gave a ringing endorsement to the reform of UNCTAD. Among the results were commitments to careful priority-setting, with an eye to generating practical results, and improved governance, including greater transparency, accountability and cost-effectiveness. Another true success of UNCTAD IX was the adoption of least developed countries issues as integral, cross-cutting and priority tasks for all four sectoral divisions. Midrand heralded a new spirit of cooperation in which the Member States worked together with the UNCTAD secretariat to streamline and improve the organization. A vigorous hands-on, take-charge approach at the highest levels within UNCTAD will help ensure the realization of the Midrand vision. I would like to mention three specific points in this connection.</div>
	<div class="p">First, in the mid-term review, the Trade and Development Board stressed Midrand's emphasis on least developed countries and called on UNCTAD to follow up the High-level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least Developed Countries' Trade Development. With only 12 months remaining before Bangkok, a number of basic elements of the work programme remain, and we will be looking to Mr. Ricupero's leadership in ensuring that these tasks are fulfilled efficiently, effectively and in a transparent manner.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, UNCTAD's comparative advantages are in trade and investment. The mid-term review sought a unique contribution for UNCTAD through its analytical function and by linking research and action, analysis and policies. UNCTAD's trade division is crucial in assisting developing countries on the critical issues in the upcoming World Trade Organization ministerial meeting.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, UNCTAD's contact with civil society is an important feature of its work. We expect to consult closely with UNCTAD in developing appropriate ground rules for partnership initiatives with the private sector.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, Midrand achieved a fundamental restructuring of UNCTAD, which held great promise and must continue, because the trade and development issues we are faced with today are even more critical than they were four years ago in the process of globalization. A rededication to this effort is the best way to ensure that UNCTAD X will build upon the successes of Midrand. We look forward to working with Secretary-General Ricupero, the Group of 77, the European Union and all other Member States, as well as the UNCTAD secretariat, as we prepare for this process.</div>

	Mr. Henze (Germany)

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European Countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated country Cyprus, as well as the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries members of the European Economic Area -- Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway -- align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union welcomes the early decision on the extension of the appointment of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In the preparation for its tenth conference, in February of the year 2000, in Bangkok, UNCTAD is in need of an experienced Secretary-General at its helm.</div>
	<div class="p">Any decision on an appointment is to be considered against the background of the requirements which the prospective holder of the appointment must be able to meet. The qualifications of the incumbent Secretary-General of UNCTAD, in our view, fully justify the extension of his appointment.</div>
	<div class="p">We trust that the process of improving the efficiency of UNCTAD, to which the European Union attaches great importance, will remain high on the Secretary-General's agenda in his second term of office.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I should like to express our conviction that the positive spirit which so far has guided our relationship with the Secretary-General of UNCTAD will also prevail during his forthcoming term of office, and I would like to take this opportunity to extend to him our congratulations and best wishes for a successful second term.</div>

	Mr. Tchoulkov (Russia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">My delegation gladly supports the Secretary-General's proposal to extend the appointment of Mr. Rubens Ricupero as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) for another term of office of four years.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe that this is a correct decision. Mr. Ricupero took charge of UNCTAD over three years ago at a difficult time for the Conference. The Conference was then facing the very complex task of implementing the timely reform of inter-agency and institutional machinery of cooperation in trade and development; of focusing the programme of work on the real needs of members; and of transforming UNCTAD into an effective agency, capable of reacting to problems arising for States in such interrelated areas as trade and development in circumstances in which the globalization of economies and the liberalization of world markets had become decisive factors of economic and social development.</div>
	<div class="p">A turning point in the execution of this task was UNCTAD IX, held in Midrand, South Africa, which determined the direction for reform in the organization. We believe that UNCTAD has made significant progress in recent years in implementing the decisions adopted in Midrand and in strengthening its role as the principal coordinating body of the United Nations system in the sphere of trade and development. We see in this the mark of Mr. Ricupero's important personal contribution. We also believe that UNCTAD's significant success in implementing the Midrand decisions is due to the fact that the Conference has devoted greater attention to the specific problems of countries with economies in transition. Many countries in this category have received concrete technical assistance from the Conference in such important issues as managing external debt, joining the multilateral trade system, enhancing the effectiveness of trade, transportation and customs services, and so on. We believe and hope that such useful work will continue in the future.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I should like to congratulate Mr. Ricupero on the extension of his appointment as Secretary-General of UNCTAD for another term of office and wish him further success in this very responsible area.</div>

We also wish to convey our heartfelt congratulations to him.</div>
	<div class="p">During the past four years under Mr. Ricupero's stewardship, UNCTAD has played a positive role in promoting the economic growth and development of the developing countries and has helped them significantly to integrate into the world economy, participate effectively in multilateral trade negotiations, predict and analyze financial crises and assess the impact of such crises on the promotion of international investment. He has also helped to channel assistance to the least developed countries.</div>
	<div class="p">UNCTAD was among the first bodies of the United Nations system to embark on structural reforms and to streamline personnel with a view to improving efficiency. It has achieved remarkable results in this undertaking. UNCTAD has continuously strengthened its links to and coordination with the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. As a result, its cooperation with these institutions has been further enhanced.</div>
