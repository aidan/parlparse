The Committee dealt with them within the framework of agenda item 18, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples". Paragraph 27 of the report contains four draft resolutions: draft resolution I, on Western Sahara; draft resolution II, on New Caledonia; draft resolution III, on American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guam, Montserrat, Tokelau, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands; and draft resolution IV, on Tokelau. Three draft decisions, on Gibraltar, Pitcairn and St. Helena, respectively, are contained in paragraph 28 of the report. In adopting those draft resolutions and decisions, the General Assembly will reaffirm, <i>inter alia</i>, the inalienable right of the peoples of those Territories to self-determination and independence and will emphasize that it is in the final analysis up to the peoples of the Territories to determine freely their future political status in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Peoples and Countries. The Fourth Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the draft resolutions and decisions in paragraphs 27 and 28, respectively, of the report.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa18">On behalf of the Fourth Committee I commend these reports to the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa19">Before concluding, I should like sincerely to thank the Chairman of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), Mr. Borys Hudyma of Ukraine, and the two Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Utula Utuoc Samana of Papua New Guinea and Mr. Abelardo Moreno Fernández of Cuba, for their advice and wholehearted cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa20">I should also like to express my gratitude to the members of the Fourth Committee, who cooperated with me throughout the session.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa21">Lastly, I should like to thank the Secretary of the Committee, Mr. Ozdinch Mustafa, and all the members of the Committee's secretariat, for their assistance and for having thereby facilitated my task as Rapporteur of the Fourth Committee.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">May I remind members that under paragraph 7 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-410.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/410</a>, the General Assembly agreed that:</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa04">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa05">May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-410.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/410</a>, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa06">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, unless the Secretariat has been notified otherwise. This means that where recorded votes were taken in the Committee, we will do the same.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa07">I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee that were adopted without a vote in the Committee.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk09-pa02">In supporting the draft resolutions submitted to us, my delegation has always been supportive of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948, relating to the right of return of Palestinian refugees.

Once again, we would like to reaffirm our solemn support of that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk09-pa03">I underline clearly and categorically that the issue of the repatriation of Palestinian refugees is of basic and crucial importance to Lebanon. We categorically reject any attempt whatsoever to settle permanently in Lebanon Palestinians living on our soil. This constant position is embodied in the Lebanese Constitution, in accordance with the Taif Agreement of 1989. It represents a firm and unshakeable national consensus among all Lebanese.</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk20-pa01">The Government of Mexico has studied very carefully the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-49-630.pdf" class="pdf">document A/49/630</a>, on agenda item 148, recommended by the Fourth Committee for adoption by the General Assembly. The draft states that the so-called &quot;occupied territories&quot; - which have been designated United Nations Protected Areas - should be reintegrated into Croatia. The text does indeed contain basic principles on international coexistence that Mexico fully supports, such as recognition of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia, respect for its international borders and the appeal to parties to resume negotiations. All of these have been endorsed by the international community and have figured prominently in various resolutions adopted by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk20-pa02">The Government of Mexico understands Croatia's desire to preserve its territorial integrity and shares its concern to defend one of the basic principles underlying this Organization. However, we feel that the final solution to the problem that is raised in this draft resolution should be the subject of appropriate negotiations in the right forums. Under the present circumstances, a decision by the United Nations General Assembly seems to us premature.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk20-pa03">Accordingly, Mexico felt obliged to abstain in the voting on the draft in the Fourth Committee and will once again abstain in the voting in this plenary meeting. We reiterate here our firm belief that only the parties themselves can resolve their dispute, and we express the hope that next year this item will no longer be on the agenda of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Verdier</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa01">The Republic of Argentina voted in favour of the draft resolution as a means of supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia, a country with which we have excellent bilateral relations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa02">Argentina, as a country contributing troops to the United Nations Protection Force, trusts that that peace-keeping force will help to bring a peaceful solution to the dispute in the region through negotiations. In this context, my country, which has a battalion deployed in Croatia, would like to reaffirm its conviction that the impartiality and neutrality of the peace-keeping forces of this Organization must be maintained.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa03">As has been pointed out repeatedly, the peace-keeping operations are not an end in themselves. Rather, they are an instrument within the logic of peace, an instrument that it uses in its endeavours to consolidate peace. Their purpose is to facilitate political settlements and overcome violence.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ponce</span> <span class="nation">Ecuador</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk05-pa01">The delegation of Ecuador abstained in the voting in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/AC.4-49-L.4.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.4/49/L.4</a> because of some unclear ideas that the draft contains and because there is insufficient information from the Secretariat in regard to some of its provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk05-pa02">Having obtained additional information, and despite some lack of clarity that still exists in the text, my delegation voted today in favour of the resolution, thereby confirming the paramount importance that Ecuador attaches to the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory through the use of force.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Granic</span> <span class="nation">Croatia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">Croatia would like to take this opportunity to express to the General Assembly at this its forty-ninth session deep appreciation for its strong vote of support for Croatia and likewise for its strong vote of confidence in the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">We are especially grateful to the 23 sponsors of this resolution. Their geographical dispersion confirms that the resolution is not exclusively about Croatia. For the majority of the Assembly's Members -- the small States -- it is a harbinger of well-being and an expression of hope that the well-established principles of international law and standards in managing international relations will not be sold short to barbaric force and aggression at any cost.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">For Croatia, this resolution is of critical importance. It is the strongest-yet defence of Croatia's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Moreover, this document addresses more clearly the responsibility of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) for the present situation in some parts of Croatia, and it calls on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to cease all activities -- military and other -- that promote and allow the occupation of sovereign Croatian territory.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">This support for Croatia's territorial integrity and sovereignty is of critical benefit to the peace process in Croatia. It clearly establishes the course that the international community will pursue. It is no wonder that members of the Contact Group have emphasized to us the value of this document to the peace process in Croatia, especially at this time.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">The Serbs in Knin should view the resolution as an extension of the three-step negotiating process. Their future is in Croatia. The economic-reintegration package that was signed last week showed that their economic welfare and prosperity is tied to Croatia. Similarly, the benefits of political reintegration into Croatia far outweigh the costs of further isolation, sanctions and war. This is not just about the objectives of my Government but about the will of the international community at its highest level.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">For the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, this resolution is incriminating. It is a call for corrective measures in respect of Croatia. Of course, the best possible corrective measure would be recognition of Croatia by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and a blockade of the relevant borders. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cannot sidestep these measures, and it should not seek to postpone them. The international community has spoken. All meddling in the affairs in the occupied territories of Croatia must cease. The occupied territories cannot be a part of that State -- in any form -- now or ever.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">I say once again that Croatia is grateful for the Assembly's overwhelming vote. This resolution is not only a clarification of the problem in the occupied territories of Croatia but also a formula for its solution -- a formula that will protect Croatia but also maintain the principles enshrined in the Charter of this Organization and the principles that protect the security and welfare of a large majority of the General Assembly's Members.</p>

In that paragraph the Assembly requested the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and to carry out those actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that had not yet exercised their right to self-determination and independence and, in particular, to formulate specific proposals for the elimination of the remaining manifestations of colonialism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa03">At its forty-sixth session the General Assembly, by adopting <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/181</a>, entitled "International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism", and the Plan of Action, mandated the Special Committee to undertake a series of activities during the Decade, including the organization of seminars to be held alternately in the Caribbean and Pacific regions during the Decade.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa04">During the year, the Special Committee, by meeting between February and September and by holding extensive consultations throughout the year among its members, was able to discharge the tasks thus entrusted to it by the Assembly and to submit appropriate recommendations on all the items referred to it for consideration and reporting.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa05">Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-52.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 48/52</a>, the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to stepping up the pace of decolonization and to facilitating the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa06">In addition, the Special Committee submitted recommendations specifically relating to activities of foreign economic and other interests which impede the implementation of the Declaration; military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration; implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations; and information transmitted under Article 73 <i>e </i>of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa07">During the year, the Special Committee devoted considerable attention to the decolonization of the small Territories. In that connection, the Special Committee was especially mindful of the fact that United Nations visiting missions had provided effective means of assessing and ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the peoples in those small Territories regarding their future status. Accordingly, it once again stressed the importance of dispatching such missions to colonial Territories in order to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration. In that connection, the Government of New Zealand, the administering Power of Tokelau, extended an invitation to the Committee to send a visiting mission to Tokelau; the Committee accepted that invitation. In July a Visiting Mission of the Special Committee was dispatched to that Territory, and during its visit the Mission was able to secure first-hand information and hear the views of the people of the Territory on their future status. An account of the Committee's consideration of, and a draft resolution on, Tokelau are contained in chapter X of the Special Committee's report (<a href="../pdf/A-49-23.pdf" class="nolink">A/49/23</a>). As regards the other Territories, the Committee will continue to seek the full cooperation of the other administering Powers with respect to sending visiting missions to Territories under their administration.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa08">On the question of publicity to be given the work of the United Nations in the field of decolonization, as reflected in chapter II of its report, the Committee again reiterated the importance of effecting the widest possible dissemination of information on decolonization as an instrument for furthering the purposes and principles of the Charter and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and for mobilizing world public opinion in support of the efforts of the peoples of colonial Territories to achieve self-determination, freedom and independence. Bearing in mind the important role played by non-governmental organizations in the decolonization process and in the dissemination of information on the situation in all the remaining small island Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Special Committee requested the departments concerned to continue their cooperation with those organizations in the dissemination of information on decolonization issues and to provide support to the peoples of those Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa09">During the year, in the light of the constructive results achieved, and in keeping with related decisions of the General Assembly, the Committee decided to continue to maintain close contact with the organizations concerned and to participate in the related conferences arranged by those organizations and by other United Nations bodies. The objective of those contacts was to facilitate the effective implementation of the decisions of the various United Nations bodies and to foster cooperation between the specialized agencies and those regional organizations in their assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories in those regions.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa10">I should like to draw the attention of members to the proposals outlined in section J, "Future work," of chapter I of the Special Committee's report, which the Special Committee hopes will meet with the Assembly's approval so that it can proceed with the effective discharge of the task that remains to be completed.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa11">The Special Committee recommended that the General Assembly renew its appeal to the administering Powers concerned to take all necessary steps for the implementation of the Declaration and the relevant United Nations resolutions, in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. In that connection, the Special Committee, bearing in mind the useful results achieved as a consequence of the active participation of the administering Powers in its work, recommended that the General Assembly again urge the administering Powers to cooperate, or to continue to cooperate, with the Special Committee in the discharge of its mandate and, in particular, to participate actively in its work relating to the Territories under their respective administrations.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa12">The General Assembly may also wish to renew its appeal to all States, the specialized agencies and other organizations within the United Nations system to comply with the various requests addressed to them by the United Nations in its resolutions on the question of decolonization.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa13">On behalf of the Committee, I commend the report to the attention of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa14">Before concluding, I should like to express to all the members of the Special Committee and, in particular, to Ambassador Fernando Remirez de Estenoz Barciela of Cuba, the Acting Chairman of the Special Committee; to Mr. Andrew Bangali of Sierra Leone, the Vice-Chairman; to Ambassador Amor Ardhaoui of Tunisia, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Small Territories, Petitions, Information and Assistance; and to Ms. Cecilia Mackenna of Chile, the Rapporteur of that Subcommittee, my deep gratitude for the cooperation and support I have received from them, which has greatly facilitated my task as Rapporteur.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I now call upon the Acting Chairman of the Special Committee, who will introduce draft resolutions <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.51.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.51</a> and L.52 in the course of his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Remirez de Estenoz Barciela</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">As Acting Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, I have the honour to address the Assembly on agenda item 18 of this forty-ninth session. Since an account of the work of the Special Committee has been given by its Rapporteur, Mr. Farouk Al-Attar of the Syrian Arab Republic, I shall confine my remarks to some of the principal developments and the remaining tasks before us in the field of decolonization.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">Permit me at the outset to express the Special Committee's satisfaction that the last remaining Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, Palau, has acceded to independence and that it will be joining the membership of the Organization during the course of this month of December. The Special Committee looks forward to working closely with the delegation of Palau in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">During this past year, the Special Committee has given close attention to the particular problems of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, resulting from their small size and population, their isolation from the main markets and their limited resources -- as is pointed out in the related conclusions and recommendations in the Special Committee's report. However, it has been a constant concern of the Committee to ensure that those characteristics are not allowed to interfere with or limit in any way the exercise by the peoples of those Territories of their right to make well-informed decisions on their future status.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">Therefore, it is essential that the administering Powers recognize those rights and shoulder their responsibility to adopt the necessary measures to permit the peoples of those Territories to make their own decisions, freely and without coercion. Furthermore, in the discharge of their primary responsibility as defined in the Charter, the administering Powers should do their utmost to ensure that the economies of the Territories they administer are placed on a sound basis, and to that end they should organize effective development programmes, both bilateral and multilateral, enlisting to the maximum extent possible the assistance available from the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations. Such programmes must protect and safeguard the best interests, both present and future, of the peoples of the colonial Territories concerned. This should remain a paramount consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">In our view, one particular area of critical importance for our work, namely, the cooperation and participation of the administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee, will require more urgent and serious attention in the future. The experience of the past few years has clearly shown that the Organization's tasks with respect to the small Territories are less onerous when it receives the full cooperation of the administering Powers concerned and when the peoples of the Territories are accorded a genuine opportunity to express their true aspirations. In that respect, the Special Committee continues to attach the utmost importance to the dispatch of visiting missions to the Non-Self-Governing Territories as the best means of securing first-hand information on the situation prevailing in the Territories and on the real opinions of their peoples. It is imperative that the Special Committee obtain that information if it is to fulfil effectively the mandate given to it by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">This year, on the invitation of the Government of New Zealand, the administering Power, the Special Committee dispatched a Visiting Mission to Tokelau. An account of that Mission is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-49-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/49/23</a>, which is before the Assembly. In that connection, I should like, on behalf of the Special Committee, to thank Ambassador Amor Ardhaoui of Tunisia for leading that Visiting Mission. I also wish to thank the members of the Mission for the work they accomplished. The Special Committee's appreciation also goes to the Government of New Zealand for its continuing cooperation in the Special Committee's work and in particular for once again enabling the members of the Special Committee to secure first-hand information on the situation in the Territory and to hear the views of the people of Tokelau regarding their future status. It is the hope of the Special Committee that other administering Powers will change their attitude and extend it the same cooperation regarding Territories under their administration, which indeed they have an obligation to do under Chapter XI of the Charter. They would thus be contributing directly to the discharge of the decolonization task of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">Those who have followed the Committee's work closely in recent years will have noted the particular attention it has devoted to the specific needs of each Territory, using all available sources of information, the most authoritative being the views of the territorial Governments and peoples concerned. The Special Committee has systematically encouraged the participation of local Governments and representatives of the peoples of those Non-Self-Governing Territories in its work and in that regard has adopted constructive measures to facilitate their presence at its sessions. We deem it particularly important that the international community as a whole participate in these contacts, thereby ensuring that it is aware of the views of those representatives concerning the future of their Territories. We are therefore encouraged by the fact that, in addition to meeting with the Special Committee, some representatives of colonial Territories have addressed the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly this year.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">We are almost at the half-way point of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, which the United Nations regards as the time-frame for completing the important task of decolonization. The objective of the Decade can be achieved only through concrete actions based on proposals reflecting the wishes of the peoples of those Non-Self-Governing Territories. In ensuring the successful attainment of the goals of the International Decade and in accordance with its Plan of Action, the Committee will continue to respond to the tasks entrusted to it. To that end, the Committee, in addition to a mid-term review of the Decade, will continue, as in the past, to conduct a thorough review of the issues on its agenda and make appropriate recommendations for further revitalizing its work.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">In the course of this year I had the honour, as a representative of the Committee, to attend the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing Countries in Barbados and to participate in the Eleventh Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries held in Cairo. It was encouraging to see the strong support given by the Ministers to the Organization's decolonization process, which was recognized as one of the greatest successes in the history of the Organization. Furthermore, the Final Declaration of the Meeting of the Non-Aligned Countries included a section on decolonization in which the Ministers reiterated their support for the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and reaffirmed that the successful completion of the decolonization process remained a major objective for the Movement. To that end, I hope that we will enjoy, in the same spirit, the support of all other Members of this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">Finally, I should like to make a few personal remarks. This year, I was able to rely on the full cooperation of my colleagues in the Special Committee. I wish to express my appreciation to them, particularly to the Vice-Chairman and the other members of the Bureau, as well as to those high-level officials of the Secretariat who have always given us their valuable support. The hard-working staff of the Secretariat who have serviced the Committee throughout the year deserve special mention, as they have decisively contributed to the successes achieved in our work.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa11">I also take this opportunity to pay a tribute to Ambassador Lohia of Papua New Guinea, my predecessor as Chairman of the Special Committee, for his work in the cause of decolonization. I wish him well in his career and in his future endeavours.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa12">Lastly, having briefly reviewed some of the principal aspects of the work of the Special Committee and in keeping with established practice, I now have the honour, on behalf of the sponsors, to introduce to the General Assembly the two draft resolutions submitted under this item, contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.51.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.51</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.52.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.52</a>. I wish to note first of all that Haiti, Mali, Namibia and the United Republic of Tanzania have become sponsors of both draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa13">As these two drafts generally reflect the elements I have just outlined, I need not elaborate on their substance. Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.51.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.51</a> addresses the most general aspects of decolonization and, in referring to the mandate of the Special Committee, approves its programme of work for 1995. Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.52.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.52</a> relates to the dissemination of information on decolonization and, in this context, once again stresses the importance of publicity as an instrument for furthering the purposes set forth in the Charter and the Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa14">On behalf of the sponsors, I submit these draft resolutions to the General Assembly and trust that their unanimous approval will reflect the importance which the international community attaches to decolonization and to the attainment of the objectives of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Meléndez</span> <span class="nation">El Salvador</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I am pleased to take part in the debate on agenda item 18 -- "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples" -- in view of our firm opposition to any form of colonialism and because it gives us the opportunity to reaffirm my country's position on the process of decolonization and, in particular, on the situation of Non-Self-Governing Territories under the responsibility of administering Powers.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">First, we wish to express our satisfaction at the accession of Palau to independence on 1 October this year. We welcome that country as a Member of our Organization and express our earnest hope that the people and Government of Palau will be able to achieve their aspirations and wishes in the new historic era they have entered. We have no doubt that they will enjoy the generous support of the international community in that endeavour. We also express our satisfaction at the progress made in eradicating other forms of domination, in particular in the elimination of racial discrimination. These are two important steps in the process of eradicating colonialism, which runs counter to the current evolution of civilization.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa03">We are five years away from the new century and it is difficult to believe, much less to accept that, despite the great progress made in the economic, political and social development of mankind and in technology, which brings countries and peoples closer together and creates greater interdependence between them, there remain vestiges of colonialism in Territories whose peoples have not been able to exercise the right to self-determination and independence.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa04">We believe that there is a consensus among States Members of the Organization on the importance of completing the process of decolonization and the need to do so, since there are solid foundations that compel us morally, politically and legally to honour our international commitments arising from our adherence to multilateral organizations and instruments.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa05">Since its inception, the Organization has had responsibilities in the field of decolonization. In Chapters XII and XIII of the Charter, the provisions concerning the international regime for administering Trust Territories have been insufficient for ensuring progress in this process. In 1960, the General Assembly adopted resolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples. Among other things, it affirms that the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights and is contrary to the Charter. It reaffirms the right of peoples to exercise self-determination freely and peacefully and the obligation of States to observe faithfully and strictly the provisions of the Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and resolution 1514 (XV).</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa06">This Declaration stimulated the process of decolonization and, fortunately, the Trust Territories gained their independence, were integrated into the international community and became Members of our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa07">Nevertheless, the process has yet to be concluded. Chapter XI of the Charter, which contains the "Declaration regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories", establishes that the administering Powers recognize that the interests of the inhabitants of the Territories are paramount and accept the obligation to promote their well-being and to assist them to develop self-government, taking due account of their political aspirations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa08">Many of the Territories covered under this concept have gained independence, but there are still 18 Territories whose status has not changed. In accordance with decisions adopted in our Organization, the Declaration on decolonization contained in resolution 1514 (XV) applies to them.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa09">In order to expedite the process, and pursuant to the objectives of the Charter in 1991, the Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/181</a>, proclaiming the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, whose ultimate goal is to enable the people of every remaining Non-Self-Governing Territory to exercise the right to self-determination pursuant to resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly -- freely and without outside pressure in order to end the process of decolonization by the year 2000. <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 46/181</a> contains a plan of action outlining the measures to be taken at the national and international levels, the roles of the United Nations and of the administering Powers, the functions to be carried out by the specialized agencies and other bodies of the United Nations system and the activities of the Special Committee on decolonization to conclude with the presentation of reports containing a study and evaluation of the activities carried out and the measures that apparently had not been implemented or had not achieved the desired results.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa10">My delegation is of the view that the elimination of colonialism must continue to be one of the Organization's priorities in this decade, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions, in particular the resolution that refers to the goals of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, in the belief that, as indicated in <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.51.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/49/L.51</a>, that there is a need to take measures to eliminate the remaining vestiges of colonialism by the year 2000, as well as other forms of domination in violation of the rights of the human person. In this regard, <a href="../pdf/A-46-634-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/46/634/Rev.1</a> of 13 December 1991 contains guidelines whose fulfilment by Member States would be of enormous assistance in achieving the goal of decolonization by the year 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa11">Considering that we will be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations next year and that the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism will be half way through its ten-year period, it would be important to assess the process of decolonization in order to determine how much progress we have made, what obstacles arose during the first five years of the Decade, and the measures to be taken to speed up the process and achieve our objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa12">My delegation, in reaffirming the validity of resolution 1514 (XV) and in supporting <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.51.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/49/L.51</a>, feels that the efforts and the political will of the administering Powers are important, as is also the involvement of other interested countries, in establishing the necessary conditions so that the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories can exercise their right to self-determination and independence. In this regard, it is essential that they cooperate both with the Special Committee on decolonization, which has been requested to make recommendations to speed up the process, as well as with the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories themselves, so that they can gain the skills and experience that will enable them to establish their own Governments and achieve independence.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa13">Finally, we also express our support for <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.52.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/49/L.52</a>, on "Dissemination of information on decolonization" which, we believe, is essential in providing information on the need to put an end to colonialism and to mobilize public opinion in favour of the process of decolonization.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa14">We trust that by the end of this decade we shall have put an end to the vestiges of colonialism, when the Organization and its Member States can feel justly proud of having carried out their responsibilities, thus allowing us to enter the new century with true universality in our Organization.</p>
