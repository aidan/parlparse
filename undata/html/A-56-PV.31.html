<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">As was announced at the 30th plenary meeting on Monday, 22 October 2001, I should like to consult the Assembly on a matter regarding the election of members of the International Law Commission, which will be held on Wednesday, 7 November 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">On that day, the Assembly will proceed to the election of 34 members of the Commission, whose terms of office are to commence on 1 January 2002. It should be recalled that, in accordance with the statute of the International Law Commission, the Secretary-General communicated to the Governments of Member States, in <a href="../pdf/A-56-117.pdf" class="pdf">document A/56/117</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-56-117-Corr.1.pdf" class="pdf">Corr.1</a>, the list of candidates submitted within the required time for the submission of nominations -- that is, by 1 June 2001. The statements of qualifications of the candidates are contained in <a href="../pdf/A-56-124.pdf" class="pdf">document A/56/124</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Subsequent to that date, the Secretary-General received additional information concerning candidates, new candidatures as well as a withdrawal. The names of the new candidates and additional information are to be found in documents <a href="../pdf/A-56-117-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/56/117/Add.1</a> and Add.2, as well as <a href="../pdf/A-56-124-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/56/124/Add.1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">Under these circumstances, it is necessary for the General Assembly to take a decision as to whether the new candidatures should be accepted in spite of the submission of their names subsequent to the deadline and whether they should be incorporated into a consolidated list of candidates. It has been the practice of the Assembly to incorporate such late submissions into a consolidated list.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">If I hear no objection, I shall take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to request the Secretary-General to issue such a consolidated list of candidates.</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg001-bk04">
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">It was so decided.</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">I apologize for interrupting the proceedings. However, with respect to the information that was given earlier concerning the elections to the International Law Commission, I would like to confirm that Africa will be allocated nine seats this time. I do so because, in some of the texts of the Secretary-General, it is not really clear as to whether Africa has eight or nine seats. But it is clear to us that Africa should have nine seats. There is one seat that rotates and that additional seat, this time, will be for Africa. This means accordingly that Africa will have nine seats this time.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">As was announced at its 29th plenary meeting on 22 October 2001, the Assembly will first proceed to a by-election to elect a member of the Economic and Social Council, in accordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">In this connection, I should like to draw the attention of members to <a href="../pdf/A-56-467.pdf" class="pdf">document A/56/467</a>, containing a letter dated 11 October 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Portugal to the United Nations. In his letter, the Permanent Representative of Portugal announces that Portugal would like to relinquish its seat on the Economic and Social Council for the year 2002, in favour of Spain.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">As a result, a vacancy will occur and a new member must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired term of office of Portugal for one year, commencing on 1 January 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa04">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account that the vacancy will occur from among the Western European and other States, the new member should therefore be elected from that region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa05">I should like to inform the Assembly that the candidate which receives a two-thirds majority of the votes of members present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote, there will be a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">I should like to inform members that, as of 1 January 2002, the following States from the Group of Western European and other States will be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Andorra, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands and the United States of America. The names of those eight States should therefore not appear on the ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">I should like to seek the usual cooperation of representatives during the time of the conduct of the election. Please be reminded that, during the voting process, all campaigning should cease in the General Assembly Hall. This means in particular that, once the election has begun, no more campaign material can be distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also requested to remain at their seats so that the voting process can proceed in an orderly manner.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">We shall now begin the voting process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">Ballot papers will now be distributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot papers and to write on them the name of the one State for which they wish to vote. A ballot paper containing more than one name from the region will be declared invalid. The name of a Member State on a ballot paper that does not belong to that region will not be counted at all.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa04">Members will recall that Portugal relinquished its seat on the Economic and Social Council effective 1 January 2002.</p>

The ballot papers reflect that pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa07">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of members present and voting will be declared elected.
