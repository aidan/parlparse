<div class="spoken" id="14-5">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Al-Kidwa" nation="Palestine" language="">
	Mr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">At this time, I would like to take the opportunity to say a few words on the issue of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, particularly as my delegation did not do so after the vote on the draft resolution related to that issue in the Third Committee. However, before doing so, I wish to express our thanks and appreciation to all those who voted in favour of the resolution entitled "The situation of and assistance to Palestinian children". We maintain the hope that those who abstained on that important and timely resolution will join the majority on this critical issue in the future as long as the conditions of Palestinian children continue to warrant such a resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">We are pleased with and very proud of the results of the vote on the resolution entitled "The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination", as well as with the impressive number of sponsors of that resolution. The right to self-determination remains a central issue for our people, and the continuous reaffirmation of that right by the international community -- such as its support for the resolution -- is essential until the actual realization of that right.</div>
	<div class="p">Nevertheless, it is imperative that we express our deep concern at the negative vote cast by Israel on the resolution. Such a vote serves only as additional proof that the Israeli Government indeed rejects a real peace settlement based on the existence of two States, Israel and Palestine. Even worse, the vote is inconsistent with the mutual recognition achieved at the beginning of the Oslo peace process between the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Reneging by one side on that mutual recognition not only is dangerous and tragic but, if established, would lead to the recognition's nullification, not only by one side but in its entirety.</div>
	<div class="p">The vote by the delegation of the United States is also very disappointing and unfortunate. That is particularly so in the light of the special responsibilities of the United States and the role that it plays in international politics, including in the Middle East. In fact, it is impossible to reconcile statements made by the President of the United States concerning his vision of a region with two States, Israel and Palestine, on the one hand, and the negative vote by the United States on this resolution, on the other. Indeed, it is extremely difficult for the Palestinian people -- and, I would imagine, even for the Israeli people -- to take such a position and vision seriously while, at the same time, witnessing a negative vote by the United States on such a resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">If we are to achieve peace in the Middle East, we need a solution that recognizes and guarantees the basic and national rights of both peoples. The recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including their right to an independent State of Palestine, is the first step in that direction. It is our hope that we will see a unanimous vote on this resolution next year.</div>

In this connection, justice requires that the minimum standards of due process be respected.</div>
	<div class="p">Costa Rica has supported the efforts of the United Nations to bring to justice those who have committed crimes against humanity in Cambodia. However, we have witnessed with concern the difficulties involved in negotiating an agreement to try those responsible for these crimes. We believe that it is essential for the Government of Cambodia to commit itself unreservedly to respecting the highest standards of justice and of due process in judging those crimes.</div>
	<div class="p">Unfortunately, the text of this draft resolution leaves doubts as to the transparency and justice of the process by which with those charged with violations of human rights will be judged. The reference to two articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in addition to being selective, undermines the principles that must be observed in any criminal proceeding.</div>
	<div class="p">Moreover, we are concerned that the text of this draft resolution limits the capacity of the Secretary-General to negotiate guarantees on the observance of the highest standards of due process. Accordingly, Costa Rica will abstain in the voting on this draft resolution, just as we did on 20 November in the Third Committee.</div>

	<div class="p">The delegation of Chile, as is our tradition, has once again supported the draft resolution on human rights and cultural diversity, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/57/556/Add.2">A/57/556/Add.2</a>, because our country attaches particular importance to respect for and coexistence of the various cultures that exist on our planet.</div>
	<div class="p">However, Chile, while reiterating its commitment to the universal validity of human rights, would like to state for the record that such universality of human rights implies acceptance of the intrinsic dignity of all the inhabitants of the earth, irrespective of culture, religion, social status, ethnic origin, gender or tradition. Neither lack of development nor cultural characteristics can be used as a pretext to justify any limitation of the rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international instruments for the promotion and protection of such rights.</div>

	<div class="p">The delegation of my country would like to speak in explanation of vote before the vote on the third preambular paragraph and operative paragraphs 6, 11, 12, 18 and 22 of draft resolution XII entitled "Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution". My country would have joined countries that support it had the content of the draft resolution been consistent with its title. Instead, it focuses on killing and forces upon us the subject of honour and sexual orientation, thus emptying the draft resolution of its original focus and making it serve a different agenda. We cannot ignore the fact that the Special Rapporteur, in her report, has gone beyond her mandate, which did not include the right to consider the controversial subjects that she dealt with. This has raised doubt, suspicion and mistrust among the negotiating countries. The Rapporteur's action is regrettable indeed. Hence, my country will vote against the controversial paragraphs, while abstaining in the vote on the draft resolution as a whole.</div>

	<div class="p">At the outset, on behalf of the people and the Royal Government of Cambodia, I would like to express our sincere thanks to all interested States, in particular Japan, France and Australia, for their efforts in drafting draft resolution A/C.3/57/L.70, for the resumption of negotiations between the Secretary-General and Cambodia on Khmer Rouge trials. My delegation was very pleased to actively engage in the process of drafting this draft resolution, which was adopted in the Third Committee on 20 November 2002.</div>
	<div class="p">In this connection, on behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia, I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincerest gratitude to all representatives for their valuable support for this draft resolution, which, indeed, is a sine qua non condition for the resumption of negotiations between my Government and the United Nations towards the establishment of a special chamber in the Cambodian Court to try the top leaders of the Khmer Rouge -- those most responsible for the crimes committed against humanity during the genocidal regime of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979 -- in accordance with international standards of justice, fairness and due process of law.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation has decided to support this draft resolution to prove our commitment and our political will to resume negotiations with the United Nations. We should therefore concentrate our efforts to bring back Cambodia and the United Nations to the negotiating table as soon as possible.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution before us is an indispensable instrument for the achievement of the lofty goal of bringing justice to the Cambodian people and to those who survived the genocidal regime.</div>
	<div class="p">May I conclude by saying that the Royal Government of Cambodia remains committed to working with the United Nations to achieve a final resolution to the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge and to blot out this mournful page of Cambodia's history.</div>
	<div class="p">On this solemn occasion, my delegation would like once again humbly to appeal to representatives kindly to give their fullest support to this draft resolution in order to pave the way for the trial of the most accountable perpetrators of crimes against humanity in the twentieth century.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">My delegation voted in favour of the resolution entitled "Promotion of the right of peoples to peace" since Mongolian principles stands firmly for promoting the right of peoples to peace.</div>
	<div class="p">In 1984 it was my country that initiated consideration by the General Assembly and adoption of the Declaration of the Right of Peoples to Peace". The importance of the Declaration at that time was in the reaffirmation of the fundamental right of peoples to live in peace, without war, as it is solemnly declared in the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that the Declaration's goal is as relevant today as it was two decades ago.</div>
	<div class="p">Given the above in mind, my delegation wishes to express some concern about bringing this issue, essentially of war and peace, to the Assembly in the context of human rights. That is narrowing substantially the scope of the right, as envisaged in the regional declaration of 1984.</div>
	<div class="p">While underlining the indispensable link between peace and human rights, my delegation feels that the issue of rights of peoples to peace would be better dealt with in more appropriate forums as, my delegation has suggested to the original sponsors of the resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, my delegation supports the view that necessary consultations should have been carried out among Member States on such an important issue before bringing the draft resolution for adoption. My delegation expresses the hope that the spirit of cooperation will prevail in the future on such important issues that affect the rights of all peoples and all Member States.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I am commenting on the Khmer Rouge trials and the resolution which the General Assembly just adopted on that subject.</div>
	<div class="p">First of all, let me express my deep appreciation to Member States for their support for this resolution. Japan believes that its adoption by the United Nations General Assembly is of great significance as it will reopen the process of bringing to justice those responsible for the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge against the people of Cambodia. At least one million people, or a quarter of the Cambodian population, is said to have been killed during the era of the Khmer Rouge.</div>
	<div class="p">It is the international community's obligation and the will of the Cambodian people to bring to justice those responsible for one of the most horrendous violations of human rights in the twentieth century.</div>
	<div class="p">The adoption of this resolution is an important step toward that goal. But I have to emphasize that it is just one step. The next step will be the resumption of negotiations between the United Nations Secretariat and the Cambodian Government on the arrangements concerning the establishment of a credible tribunal. Let us not underestimate the difficulties of this endeavour. The Secretary-General and the Secretariat have a particularly important role to play in the negotiations before and during the trials. We appeal to the Secretariat to make every effort in the negotiations to ensure that a credible tribunal is established as soon as possible in accordance with this resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Japan has worked very hard over the past month to address some of the concerns the Secretariat had in the course of its past negotiations with the Cambodian Government. We believe that, with a clear mandate contained in this resolution, the Secretariat is now in a better negotiating position. Japan is ready to extend support to the effort of the Secretary-General to reach an agreement with the Cambodian Government. Now that the resolution is adopted without any opposition, we call on all Member States, including those who abstained in the voting on the resolution, to join us in this endeavour. Indeed, the Secretary-General needs and expects the broad support of the international community as he undertakes his important task.</div>
	<div class="p">Last but not least, let me also appeal to the Cambodian Government to fully commit itself to establishing credible trials. In this connection, I am very pleased to have heard the strong commitment from the Cambodian Ambassador. It is after all, the Government of Cambodia and its people who requested these trials and it is they who have the most at stake. We hope that the Cambodian Government will take the lead in the process and engage sincerely and in good faith in the negotiations with the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me stress once again that the success of the process leading to credible trials depends on the efforts and the commitment of the parties concerned together with the understanding and cooperation of all interested Member States.</div>

	<div class="p">My delegation has taken the floor to make a general comment on the report of the Third Committee, particularly document <a href="../pdf/A/57/556/Add.2">A/57/556/Add.2</a>. It was the understanding we had in the Committee that the comment made by my delegation concerning rule 89 of the rules of procedure will be duly reflected in the report. Unfortunately, it was not. That is why I have to repeat what I said in the Committee and maybe even to elaborate.</div>
	<div class="p">My comment concerns rule 89 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, and particularly the fourth sentence of this rule, which reads as follows: "If the motion for division is carried, those parts of the proposal or of the amendment which are approved shall then be put to the vote as a whole". My reading of this sentence is that if a part of a resolution is voted on, be it one paragraph or two paragraphs, then the whole resolution should be automatically put to a vote without the need for any delegation to request a vote. I understand that that has not been common practice in the Committee or in other Committees of the General Assembly, but I am afraid that that must change, for two reasons.</div>
	<div class="p">First, with regard to procedure: my delegation believes that the rules of procedure were established and amended -- the most recent amendment was made eight years ago -- in order to be followed at all times and under all circumstances, not upon request. We have established rules of procedure to govern our work, and we should abide by them.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, concerning substance: I think that following this rule will make delegations more eager to achieve consensus, which will benefit the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, ensuring that they reflect the largest possible majority of members of the international community. That is why there should be no doubt that, beginning next year, my delegation will insist on invoking rule 89 with respect to any draft resolution that contains a part adopted by a vote, and I think that it should be the responsibility of the Bureaus of the Committees to do this as well. I understand and accept the explanation given to my delegation this year by the Bureau of the Third Committee regarding the practical reasons that made that impossible, but I hope that, beginning in the fifty-eighth session, all the rules of procedure will be followed and respected.</div>

	<div class="p">My delegation joined in the consensus on draft resolution XVII. In Russia, we know what terrorism represents and the suffering that it causes among individual citizens. When one addresses the issue of human rights and terrorism, it is important to consider that terrorism is an exceptional phenomenon and that the measures taken by Governments to combat it have an exceptional nature, with consequences for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Accordingly, we believe that the text of the draft resolution should have been considered more carefully to ensure that it reflected in a more balanced and more accurate way the approaches taken by all States in finding a solution to a very sensitive issue for the international community: guaranteeing human rights in the fight against terrorism. We believe that that is how this issue should be considered at the United Nations in the future.</div>

	<div class="p">Since my delegation has already made a general statement in the Third Committee, we should now like to speak in explanation of vote regarding draft resolution I, on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/57/556/Add.3">A/57/556/Add.3</a>. We thank the delegation of the European Union for its efforts on that draft resolution. However, we should like to state the following.</div>
	<div class="p">First of all, I am sure that everyone has been following the developments in the situation in the Sudan and the peace process in that country. As we speak, two delegations -- those of the Government of the Sudan and of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement -- are meeting in Washington within the framework of measures aimed at achieving peace. That meeting is taking place as an extension of the African measures adopted in Kenya this year, which led to a cessation of hostilities -- hence the flow of humanitarian assistance and the cessation of killing.</div>
	<div class="p">We are immensely interested in human rights issues, and we have no objection to the consideration of such issues, as long as they are addressed with full impartiality and objectivity. Most of the European sponsors of this draft resolution are fully aware of the peace process in the Sudan, and we thank them for that. However, the official positions and statements of their Governments concerning the peace process totally contradict the tenor of this draft resolution; indeed, they are diametrically opposed to it. On the one hand, they are in favour of the peace process, and we are grateful for that. On the other hand, while attempting to satisfy certain pressure groups led by certain non-governmental organizations in their own countries, the draft resolution does the opposite. Therefore, we reject this draft resolution, which is not objective or impartial. It is totally politicized. Therefore, my delegation will vote against it and will request all other States to vote against it for the following reasons.</div>
	<div class="p">First, there is a need to send a message of encouragement to the Government of the Sudan to continue to make progress on the path of peace on which it has embarked and is about to be completed, in order to put an end to suffering in the Sudan. The war is one of the main causes of human rights violations and is itself a human rights violation.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, by voting against the draft resolution, we are showing that it is not objective or impartial.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, this draft resolution is politicized first and foremost. Human rights issues are too lofty to be subjected to political agendas.</div>
