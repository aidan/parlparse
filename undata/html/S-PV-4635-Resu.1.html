<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Japan. I invite her to take a seat at the Council table and to make her statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Saiga</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation for this opportunity to present the views of Japan at this open meeting to commemorate the second anniversary of the historic adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. I also pay tribute to the President of the Security Council, Ambassador Belinga-Eboutou of Cameroon, for demonstrating his commitment to this agenda item by convening today's meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">I welcome the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security, as well as the study prepared by his Special Adviser on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women in cooperation with the Inter-agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security. The recommendations contained in the study will provide useful general guidance in strengthening international efforts for the protection of women and girls in armed conflict, the promotion of women's participation in peace-building, and the integration of gender perspectives in peace processes and conflict resolution. I also look forward to the field-based assessment by the two independent experts under the auspices of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, to be issued later this week.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">Today, I would like to offer three general comments on the Special Adviser's study.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa04">First, I would like to underscore the importance of education, training and capacity-building, which is repeatedly stressed in various contexts throughout the study. Education and public awareness are key to preventing violence against women and girls, and the training and capacity-building of women are critical to increasing their participation in various aspects of a peace process. Japan's strong belief in women's education is reflected, for example, in the economic assistance it has provided to Afghanistan for the rehabilitation of a damaged girls' elementary school in Kabul last April and for the construction of a vocational training centre for women.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa05">The second point I wish to make is that, while the 78 recommendations in the study provide useful general guidance, it is necessary to formulate detailed strategies for translating them into concrete actions and for following them up on a regular basis. This will require ongoing discussion by Member States and the Secretariat. Japan, for its part, would like to suggest that the Security Council, in consultation with interested Member States, formulate a road map identifying which agencies are to assume responsibility for what kinds of actions, in which areas and according to what timetable.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa06">Thirdly, it is my delegation's view that, since the recommendations cover such a wide range of areas, implementation and follow-up should not be left solely to the Security Council, but should involve the United Nations system as a whole. My delegation therefore hopes that the Inter-agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security will continue its efforts to strengthen coordination and collaboration among the various United Nations agencies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa07">At the same time, let us not forget that the issue of women, peace and security is intricately intertwined with two other issues - children in armed conflict and the protection of civilians in armed conflict - which the Council has considered in recent years. Japan therefore believes that the Council, the United Nations primary organ for the maintenance of international peace and security, should address all three of these issues in an integrated manner. At the same time, the offices within the Secretariat responsible for these issues - the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women, the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflicts and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - should collaborate more closely and identify best practices among their activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa08">Today's open meeting demonstrates the importance which the Security Council attaches to the issue of women, peace and security, and provides us with a valuable opportunity to exchange our views on the issue. But the issue of gender mainstreaming in peace and security is too important to be considered just once a year on a special occasion. Indeed, it should be integrated into ongoing discussions and activities throughout the United Nations system, including in the Security Council. Japan would therefore like to engage other interested Member States, as well as the Secretariat, in substantive discussions aimed at implementing the recommendations contained in the study.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of India, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chowdhury</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">We applaud you, Sir, for organizing this open debate on so important a topic. We also thank the Secretary-General for according it importance through his presence yesterday and his opening remarks.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">Bangladesh deemed it a privilege to have been the delegation to propose in the Council, during its presidency in March 2000, that a statement be issued on women, peace and security. The presidential statement contained in press release <i>(SC/6816)</i> of 8 March 2000 recognized some of the following premises.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">First, peace is inextricably linked with equality between women and men. Second, the equal access and full participation of women in power structures and their full involvement in all efforts for the prevention and resolution of conflicts are essential for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Third, while entire communities suffer the consequences of armed conflict, women and girls are particularly affected. Fourth, women constitute the majority of the world's refugees and internally displaced persons. Fifth, although women have begun to play an important role in conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peace building, they are still underrepresented in decision-making in regard to conflict. Sixth, if women are to play an equal part in security and in the maintenance of peace, they must be empowered politically and economically and represented adequately at all levels of decision-making, both at the pre-conflict stage and during hostilities, as well as at the point of peacekeeping, peace-building, reconciliation and reconstruction. Seventh, there must be no impunity for war crimes against women and girls. Eighth, it is important to promote an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and programmes while addressing armed or other conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa04">Two years later, those premises remain valid. We worked further on those objectives with fellow Council members. The outcome was the landmark <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, with Namibia taking the lead. That resolution provided the legislative mandate for immediate attention and for defining further actions.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa05">I wish now to refer to the report of the Secretary-General, which we deeply appreciate; in particular, the proposed set of 21 actions. We are also in considerable debt to Angela King, Carolyn Hannan and others for the very substantive inputs they provided in defining the tasks. Acknowledgement is further owed to the contribution of Noeleen Heyzer and the Inter-agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security in connection with the process.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa06">Bangladesh hopes that the Security Council will examine those proposals with a view to approving them. The Secretary-General should have the necessary mandate for their early implementation. We also place emphasis on a few specific areas.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa07">First, the Security Council must demand of all parties to armed conflict that they comply fully with international law applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls. The legal obligation must also extend to women and girls under occupation in Palestine and in other occupied Arab territories.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa08">Secondly, the Security Council must add its voice to ensuring that there is no impunity for gender-based crimes. There have been allegations of violence against women, including rape, as weapons of war.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa09">Thirdly, the Council should consider, where appropriate, the establishment of gender advisers or units in multidimensional peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa10">Fourthly, to facilitate greater contact with women's groups and networks, a database of gender specialists, as well as of women's groups and networks, in countries and regions in conflict has to be established.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa11">Fifthly, it is heartening to learn that some progress has already been achieved in incorporating gender perspectives into peacekeeping operations -- the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, to cite a few.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa12">Finally, efforts are needed to achieve greater representation of women in formal peace negotiations. We have seen the positive contribution of women to the inter-Congolese dialogue that set an example.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa13">The experience of gender advisers and gender units in United Nations missions in East Timor, Kosovo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sierra Leone have amply vindicated our conviction about the role of women in peace and security. Not only in peacekeeping missions, but also at the grassroots and community levels, women have organized resistance to militarization and have created space for dialogue and moderation. By bringing their experience to the peace table, women can inject into the peace process a practical understanding of the various challenges confronted by women in times of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa14">Amartya Sen has warned, "When a nation allows a lower status for its women in any sphere of human activity, it does so at its own peril". In consonance with Bangladesh's positive attitude towards the effective mainstreaming of gender in all walks of life and as part of our commitment to strengthening the role of women in peace and security, we have begun to associate women with United Nations peace operations across a broad spectrum of missions.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa15">Bangladesh is a member of the Group of Friends of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, formed at the initiative of Canada. We remain engaged in the implementation of that resolution. We look forward to a positive decision on the Secretary-General's recommendations. We see those as a forward movement, not just in gender equality - though also that - but mainly in the forging of a harmonious cooperation between the sexes to advance the interests of this Organization and the aspirations common to all humankind.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Egypt. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aboul-Gheit</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">The report of the Secretary-General, submitted to the Council today, refers to the fact that women do not enjoy equal standing with men in any society. Moreover, in societies where the culture of violence and discrimination against women and girls prevails, prior to the outbreak of internal conflict, the situation deteriorates during the course of such conflict. If women do not take part in decision-making in a given society, they are not likely to share in decision-making concerning the conflict itself or the establishment of peace after the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">In that regard, Egypt wishes to express its profound concern at the increasing rate of violence against women and children during armed conflict and the negative economic, social, psychological and physical consequences of such violence. That is why Egypt wishes to contribute effectively to eliminating all injustice against women. Last September, Egypt convened and hosted a conference at Sharm el-Sheikh in order to establish a new international movement for women and peace under the auspices of Mrs. Suzanne Mubarak, the First Lady. Several prominent international personalities took part in the conference. The conference was aimed at launching a series of activities with a view to convening a general international conference in 2004 that will deal with the issue of women and peace. The conference affirmed the need to recognize women as an effective element in settling disputes and their contribution to efforts to establish peace.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Several positive steps have recently been taken that have helped focus attention on the needs and the status of women in areas of conflict through the development of special units, which have been included in United Nations peacekeeping operations, particularly in Africa. We thus appreciate the positive role played by the gender units in the United Nations Mission Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). We hope to see that role expanded with the deployment of phase III of MONUC in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Furthermore, we hope that the units will be maintained when the Security Council reduces the size of UNAMSIL after the establishment of security and stability in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">As we deal today with ways and means of protecting women during conflict and promoting their role and participation following the settlement of conflicts, we cannot ignore the cries of help from Palestinian women living in the most dire and inhuman circumstances. We refer here to the suffering of Palestinian women and their deteriorating status under occupation. This matter is very important to us in Egypt. Palestinian women -- wives, mothers and daughters -- are not only killed alongside men as a result of Israeli military action; they are also wounded as a result of indiscriminate shooting by both the Israeli occupation army and settlers.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Moreover, they are subject to the loss of their means of livelihood, to oppression and intimidation, and they must endure the consequences of changes in social relations and structures as a result of the death of family members.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">That is why the Egyptian delegation deems it imperative that the Security Council deal with the situation of Palestinian women under occupation by stressing the imperative need for total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories and for the restitution of the land to its rightful owners, within the framework of a just and comprehensive peace based on United Nations and internationally binding resolutions and on the principle of land for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">I wish once again to reiterate Egypt's firm stance, which we have often expressed before the Council, on the importance of protecting women and children during armed conflict within a broader context -- that of the protection of all civilians.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">In this respect, I would like to underline two important points.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">First, the Council must maintain the delicate balance between its own work and that of the other bodies of the United Nations, in keeping with the Charter of the Organization, particularly the need to respect the fundamental role of the General Assembly in dealing with humanitarian, economic and social questions and human rights issues, including those related to women.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">Secondly, we would like to reaffirm that international humanitarian practices must not contradict the principle of respect for and implementation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations or the provisions of international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">While we welcome the Council's readiness to respond rapidly in cases where civilians are targeted and where deliberate action is taken to block the delivery of urgent humanitarian assistance to those in need, we would like to reaffirm that such action should be taken within the framework of the provisions and the articles of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">In this respect, if the Council is unable, for reasons beyond its control, to assume its responsibilities, perhaps we could benefit from the General Assembly resolution entitled "Uniting for peace".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">We would like also to reiterate the importance of respecting the various international conventions and agreements relating to women when we discuss the issue of women, peace and security. Foremost among these instruments is the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and its two Additional Protocols of 1977, which together represent the legal basis for the protection of women and girls during armed conflict. Also important are  the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the outcome of the Beijing Conference and its Platform of Action. Together, these conventions constitute the basis for international efforts to include the gender dimension in every aspect of the work of the Organization and to recognize the vital role of women in the establishment of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">Egypt welcomes the fact that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) includes the gender dimension in its articles. Thus its definition of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide includes gender-based violence, rape, forced prostitution, trafficking in persons, and torture and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment, including enslavement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa15">Egypt also welcomes the fact that the Statute of the ICC has ensured gender-sensitive justice that includes the adoption of necessary measures to protect victims and witnesses, equitable representation of male and female judges, and the availability of legal expertise on such specific issues as violence against women.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Manalo</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">Allow me to join others in commending you, Mr. President, for convening this important meeting on women and peace and security, on the basis of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. In this regard, my delegation renews its commitment to enhancing the role of women in resolving and preventing conflicts as well as in peacekeeping and peace-building efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">My delegation also wishes to express its appreciation of the efforts of the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women, which worked in close cooperation with the Inter-agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security in undertaking the study on women, peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">That study recognizes, among other things, that after an armed conflict situation, women and girls face the formidable task of rebuilding their lives, a situation which is worsened when they also have to deal with intimidation, physical threats and domestic violence.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">It has been two years since Member States reaffirmed the Beijing Platform for Action, and much remains to be done in mainstreaming gender in peacekeeping and disarmament. If progress is to be made towards a gender perspective in relation to peace and security, Governments must learn from the experiences of women and girls during armed conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Armed conflicts have often led to the perpetration of rape and sexual violence, and women and girls are usually the victims. In the process, some have become infected with HIV/AIDS. Aside from sexual violence, women and girls have also been victims of abduction, forced prostitution and trafficking imposed by military, paramilitary and other groups.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">The experiences and sufferings of women and girls as victims of armed conflict will be helpful in addressing the root causes of conflict, and it is also important that their participation in peace processes, whether formally or informally, be considered as essential and important.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">Adequate measures and mechanisms must also be taken by United Nations agencies and other relief organizations assisting in humanitarian operations to protect women and girls from violence. Basic goods and services as well as access to social and economic programmes must be made available to this vulnerable group.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">In the Philippines, the plight of women in conflict has received greater attention with our 25-year plan for women. It contains gender-responsive peacekeeping and peace- building programmes, including gender-responsive peace education. Specifically, our Plan for Gender-Responsive Development includes strategies to integrate women in peace consultations as well as to institutionalize the participation of women in conflict-resolution, unification and reconciliation processes.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">My Government looks to the Security Council to provide the momentum for promoting the involvement of women in finding solutions to armed conflict and in peacekeeping and peace-building. In the report of the Secretary-General, concrete recommendations for practical and workable mechanisms for gender mainstreaming in peace and security have been put forth.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">Regarding the Secretary-General's recommendations on reconstruction and rehabilitation, the Philippines has been working towards mainstreaming women and children's peace agendas, including socio-economic reforms in programmes for grass-roots peace movements. These include sensitizing government to the gender concerns of women through dialogue, organizing and strengthening women's organizations and reviewing gender responsiveness of legislation, policies and programmes related to peacekeeping and peace-building. Finally, we hope that the Council will be able to examine closely the Secretary-General's recommendations at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Australia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tesch</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa01">I would like to thank you, Sir, for allowing me the opportunity again to address the Council under your presidency and, in particular, to speak on behalf of the Australian delegation on this very important topic. We also greatly appreciate the personal introduction by the Secretary-General of his report.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa02">Two years after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, no one can seriously question how central gender issues are to preventing and resolving conflict and to rebuilding communities after conflict. At a time when too many resolutions and statements languish on shelves, that is no small achievement. The study on women, peace and security -- a large measure of the funding for which Australia was pleased to provide -- and the Secretary-General's report on the study maintain the momentum of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and are both to be welcomed.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa03">The detailed information contained in those two documents should leave us in no doubt that, if we are serious about conflict resolution, we must be serious about gender perspectives on conflict. Gender perspectives are neither marginal nor optional; they cannot and should not be an afterthought. Rather, new patterns of conflict, and the fact that women and girls are too often the chief victims of conflict, mean that gender is central to much that this Council and United Nations peacekeeping operations do.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa04">The recommendations and the presentation of facts in the study and the Secretary-General's report speak for themselves. Together with the complementary study produced under the auspices of United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), they provide us with a valuable and sensible guide to how we can further implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and how we can ensure that women's and girls' perspectives are systematically incorporated into all of our efforts to preserve and restore peace.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa05">I would like to highlight two of the many important observations of the studies. The first is that pre-conflict inequities and disregard for women's rights become worse during conflict. Indeed, such inequities, and in particular the lack of empowerment and participation on the part of women, reduce the capacity of communities to avoid conflict. A clear focus on empowering women before conflicts break out, therefore, should be a key element of a strategy of conflict prevention -- which, after all, should be our primary objective.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa06">Secondly, we need to see women as important contributors to peace and not simply as victims of conflict. We must be diligent and creative in giving women a role in peace processes. Here, the Council can play an important leadership role, particularly in designing its mandates and ensuring that the necessary resources are made available to ensure the fulfilment of those mandates. The experience of our region -- the Solomon Islands, Bougainville and East Timor -- gives ample testimony to the vital difference that women can make to the course of a conflict. I shall not go into the details of those regional experiences here, as they are set out in the written text of my statement. They are also discussed in the statement by the representative of Fiji, who spoke on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum group of countries.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa07">I should say, however, that Australia's development cooperation programme recognizes the social and gender dimensions of conflict, and therefore supports the goal of increasing women's participation in decision-making and their access to and control over resources. It is working to ensure that women play an equal role in political structures and in community decision-making.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa08">In June this year Australia launched its peace, conflict and development policy. The policy provides a framework for improving the ability of our development cooperation programme to address conflict and instability. This means there will be a greater emphasis on conflict prevention and peace-building, alongside the aid programme's more traditional missions of humanitarian relief and reconstruction. Given the importance of ensuring the active engagement of women in peace-building processes, the development cooperation programme will improve the integration of gender principles into all aid responses.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa09">In future, we will also support those elements of society which work for the peaceful resolution of disputes and grievances. The role that women can play as peace-builders will be a particular focus, and we look forward to continuing to contribute to this very important issue.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdés</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">I would like to commend you, Sir, for your decisive and outstanding performance as President of the Security Council during a particularly demanding month, and to thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">Just three months ago, in this very Chamber, we had an opportunity to reflect on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security, which reaffirmed the important role of women in the prevention of conflict, in peace-building and in post-conflict reconstruction. Today, we have another important element to enrich our discussion: the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security. Because of its comprehensiveness and the aptness of its recommendations, we consider it to be a core document for the future treatment of this important subject.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">We would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the independent experts of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, Ms. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and Ms. Elizabeth Rehn, and we welcome the statement to be made later by the representative of Austria, on behalf of the Human Security Network, of which Chile is a part.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The Fourth World Conference on Women is considered to have laid the groundwork for future discussions about the role of women in conflict resolution and the maintenance of peace at all levels. Since then, the international community has witnessed a sharp and steady increase in multilateral initiatives to empower women so that they can play a more important role in decision-making with regard to conflicts. Although useful, those initiatives are still insufficient. We would therefore like to recall the Secretary-General's statement that peace is indissolubly linked to equality between women and men and to development.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Even as I deliver this statement, entire communities are suffering from the consequences of armed conflict and terrorism. Women and girls in particular are affected, because of their status in society and their gender. Their human rights are systematically violated to a degree that can only be guessed at.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">There are a number of measures that we can take to prevent this from continuing. As we stated on a similar occasion in this very Chamber, these include effective steps to remove the barriers that prevent women from effectively participating in decision-making and from gaining access to the circles of power. In this connection, my country supports the view that mainstreaming a gender perspective into peacekeeping operations must be given priority in governmental agendas.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">We agree with, and consider it necessary to highlight, the point made in the report of the Secretary-General that the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in peacekeeping operations is a key requirement for promoting gender equality in a sustainable manner over time. The Secretary-General clearly states that this lays the foundation for rebuilding societies after conflict and commonly determines the political, civil, economic and social structures in post-conflict situations. We also agree that this is a responsibility incumbent upon all of us, men and women alike.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">We reiterate our view that it is essential to increase the number of women appointed as special representatives or envoys of the Secretary-General to undertake peace missions, and we call for a greater presence of women as military observers, as members of civilian police forces and as humanitarian and human rights personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">Chile believes that the promotion of the role of women in society, particularly political participation, is a State priority. Our country has actively participated in all the international debates on this topic and has fulfilled out all the commitments it has undertaken. It is in this context that it welcomed with great enthusiasm and renewed optimism the Council's adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and that it today endorses the report of the Secretary-General because of its validity.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa10">The time has come to bridge the gap between intentions and reality. In our many and extensive discussions, we have touched upon practically all elements related to the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the various phases of all peace processes. We already have a great deal of information on the problems of women and children on the ground and on their strengths and weaknesses. We have pledged to adopt a series of measures, and we have succeeded in creating a solid international legal framework. However, in practice, we still have not been able to implement all of those measures.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa11">This is a task for Governments, the United Nations system and civil society alike. We cannot fail to mention the role that has been recognized as belonging to civil society, particularly to the networks of women's organizations working on the ground. That is very clearly stated in the report of the Secretary-General. Chile's work in these and other areas is of particular importance, as demonstrated by our numerous activities in conjunction with civil society. organizations</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa12">In the framework of our discussion on the need to work towards implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, we welcome the concrete proposal made yesterday by the representative of the United Kingdom: each year to request a member of the Council to supervise the implementation of our decisions on the mainstreaming of a gender perspective, working with the relevant entities of the Secretariat to achieve that goal.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa13">Lastly, we reiterate our hope that the international Conference on Women in Peace Operations, which will be held in Chile on 4 and 5 November, and which we have organized together with the Presidency of the European Union -- as the representative of Denmark mentioned yesterday -- will open new avenues for the practical implementation of the item under discussion. Similarly, we hope that the report before the Council today and the important debate in which we have participated will serve to enrich those discussions.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Allow me to begin by expressing our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for convening today's open debate on this item. We welcome this discussion on an issue that we consider of great importance. We also look forward to the independent expert assessment on the impact of armed conflict on women and the role of women in peace-building. We view the present initiative as an important opportunity to reflect on the plight of women in conflict situations as well as on their role in conflict resolution, conflict prevention and peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">The plight of women in armed conflict has a history which is as long as the history of warfare. The American writer Kate Richards O'Hare wrote almost a century ago: "It is the women ... who pay the price while war rages, and it will be the women who will pay again when war has run its bloody course". There are specific injunctions -- in the Geneva Conventions and in human rights instruments -- proscribing torture, violence, rape and other ill-treatment of women during conflicts. Unfortunately, those injunctions have been honoured more in the breach than in the observance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The march of civilization has not reduced the suffering and special vulnerabilities of women in situations of armed conflict. Crimes against women have been frequent in several recent and ongoing conflicts. Systematic rape has been used to terrorize populations, force displacement and demoralize adversaries -- as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Afghanistan's two decades of conflict, the destitution of hundreds of thousands of women was a pervasive consequence.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">In the ongoing freedom struggle in Jammu and Kashmir also, rape and the humiliation of women and girls have been used by the occupation army as an instrument of war. Human rights organizations have testified since 1992 that in Jammu and Kashmir "rape and ill-treatment of women are usually reported to have taken place during counter-insurgency operations" by Indian forces. Asia Watch and Physicians for Human Rights documented the extensive use of rape by the occupation forces designed "to punish and humiliate the entire community." Amnesty International has reported that "harassment, abduction, rape and deliberate and arbitrary killings perpetrated by [pro-Indian] `renegades' in ... Kashmir" are also carried out "with the support of the [Indian] security forces".</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">Destitution of women is another manifestation of the conflict in Kashmir. There are thousands of women who have been widowed, or whose husbands have been maimed, have disappeared or are in detention. We urge the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to prepare a survey of the number of such destitute Kashmiri women. The international community should take appropriate measures to provide help and compensation to those Kashmiri women. We urge humanitarian agencies, specially the International Committee of the Red Cross, to act as the instrument and avenue for such relief distribution. Political considerations should not stand in the way of international humanitarian agencies responding to the plight of Kashmiri women and children suffering from the long and bloody conflict in their homeland.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">In April 2000, the Security Council adopted its landmark <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and armed conflict. The Beijing Declaration and the Platform of Action also contain comprehensive recommendations on women and armed conflict. The Security Council must strengthen the processes for the observance and implementation of the principles of international humanitarian law and human rights in international conflicts, including those relating to the protection of women.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">We believe that the Council must not only ensure prompt and effective responses to crisis situations, irrespective of their geographical location, but also avoid selectivity in the implementation of its resolutions. The Charter contains provisions, including those in Chapter VI, which can be utilized to promote implementation of Council resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">In the international experts assessment and the Secretary-General's report several relevant proposals have been submitted to the Council. The Pakistan delegation further suggests the following measures for the Council's consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">First, the Council should adopt a declaration that the targeting of women, especially the use of rape as an instrument of war, will be considered a war crime, susceptible to national and international punishment. Secondly, a study of recent and ongoing conflict situations should be initiated to identify crimes committed against women, with a view to seeking redress and compensation for the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Thirdly, current and future United Nations peacekeeping operations be required to monitor, and regularly report to the Security Council on, the situation of women and girls in their mission areas. Fourthly, the fullest possible participation of women in peace processes and in post-conflict peace-building should be encouraged, including the reintegration, reconstruction and rehabilitation of societies in the post-conflict phase.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">Fifthly, the United Nations specialized organs and agencies should be asked to develop ways to address the special needs of women and girls affected by conflict, including health and psychological care. Sixthly, the Security Council may involve other United Nations bodies, as well as representatives of the civil society, perhaps using the Arria formula, for a comprehensive discussion to promote such recommendations and actions.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Laurin</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">Thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this important open debate. It is now two years since the passing of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. This resolution was a watershed in acknowledging the different impacts of war on women and girls and the critical and unique contributions women make to peace-building and reconstruction. We recognize, though, that while the United Nations system has made progress, we are closer to the beginning of our work than to the end.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">This week's release of the much anticipated report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security reminds us that full implementation of this important resolution is crucial. Canada supports the Secretary-General's call for stronger integration of gender considerations throughout the work of the Security Council and the United Nations system. As France said, we believe that the members of the Council should request and make use of information on the situation of women and girls in its consideration of particular conflict situations. The Council should ensure that gender aspects are seriously considered in its analysis and are reflected in its decisions. This approach must become just as routine as financial probity.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">The limit to the Secretary-General's reports should not prevent the integration of gender perspectives.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Laurin</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa01">The Council should be carefully looking at implementation mechanisms. In this regard, we strongly support Colombia's suggestion that a plan of action be prepared. We also welcome the United Kingdom's proposal to identify each year a member of the Security Council to oversee the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and work with the appropriate parts of the Secretariat to achieve that. We join the representative of the United States in looking forward to having dialogue with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and with the Department of Political Affairs on how they mainstream a gender perspective in their activities.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa02">Canada welcomes the Secretary-General's report, and we share his concerns, as women and girls continue to be severely targeted in and negatively impacted by armed conflict. We are pleased to see the comprehensive and wide-ranging recommendations for action in the study and the report. The recommendations, we hope, will cause Member States to move beyond words to action.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa03">Canada, as we stated at the open meeting on 25 July 2002, continues to actively implement the commitments we made at the time of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, and we call upon all Member States to do likewise. We refer to the March 2002 aide-memoire adopted by the Council and stress that the issue of women, peace and security needs to be considered as part of the agenda on the protection of civilians.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa04">We also call for explicit reference to gender considerations in the mandates of all the Special Representatives of the Secretary-General. We encourage the Council to take advantage of the appearances of Special Representatives in this forum to hold them accountable on these aspects of their missions.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa05">Integration of gender perspectives in peace support operations is vital. In this regard, we look forward to the upcoming report of the Secretary-General requested by the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly on the gender mainstreaming strategy for all of the Organization's peacekeeping activities and the associated resources required to achieve this. We will again urge our Fifth Committee colleagues to authorize the resources needed to strengthen the capacity of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations specifically to address gender issues.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa06">Gender advisers in the field deserve proper support from Headquarters, as recommended by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. This support is essential to their success.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa07">Canada also wishes to underscore the need for continued efforts in the post-conflict reconstruction phase. The Security Council, the United Nations and Member States have every interest in ensuring that the rights of women and girls are not set aside in reconstruction situations, such as Afghanistan.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa08">The signing of a formal peace agreement does not necessarily eradicate violence in communities and families. Domestic violence must be addressed in the building of sustainable peace for all -- women, men, girls and boys. We are encouraged to see the recognition of the link between women's security and domestic violence in conflict and post-conflict situations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa09">Canada shares the view expressed by the representative of Liechtenstein on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. My Government welcomes the emphasis the Secretary-General placed on the importance of the continued expansion of the international legal framework to address particular crimes experienced by women in armed conflict. Given the extremely serious gender-based crimes that occurred during the decade long civil war in Sierra Leone, we commend the prosecutor of the Sierra Leone special court for appointing two gender advisers. His action is important progress.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa10">My delegation would like to join the voice of delegations calling for a better gender balance throughout the United Nations system. We refer specifically to the message expressed last week by the Third Committee of the General Assembly in adopting the draft resolution sponsored by Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system. By this text, more than one hundred and twenty-five co-sponsors expressed concern that only one out of fifty-one special representatives or envoys of the Secretary-General is a woman, and that the percentage of women assigned to peace operations has decreased. The draft also urged the Secretary-General to redouble his efforts to realize significant progress towards the goal of 50 per cent in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa11">We look forward to the release of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) report and to further collaboration with other Member States, including the Friends of Women, Peace and Security and our human security network partners, on the follow-up work to be done.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa12">Canada strongly and actively supports full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We thank you again, Sir, for providing a forum for this important debate.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sun Joun-yung</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">It  has been two years since a momentous development for women was marked with the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. Today, as much of the attention here at the United Nations evolves around a potential conflict with far-reaching implications for the world, it is all the more appropriate that we should, even at this late date, take this day to explore how peace may be strengthened, specifically by reaffirming our resolve to turn the goals of the historic resolution into reality, thus incorporating women into all matters and efforts relating to peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">The Secretary-General's report is comprehensive in its analysis and suggestions for action. Many of the suggested actions contained in the report open up new vistas for integrating gender perspectives and increasing the participation of women in peace processes, peacekeeping, humanitarian operations, reconstruction and rehabilitation, and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. The concreteness of the suggestions is most welcome.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">In particular, I believe that the collection of data related to peace operations disaggregated by gender and age, as suggested in the report, should be a priority action if other actions are to find relevance to the reality on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">Furthermore, the increased profile for women and girls both as beneficiaries and participants in the initial stages of humanitarian operations, as suggested in recommended Action 14, would prevent women and girls from falling victim to later abuses and violence that prey upon their particular vulnerabilities in crisis situations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">Indeed, prevention is a key aspect of any lasting problem-solving effort. In this regard, I would like to point out the relative lack of attention given to the role women can play in preventing disruption of peace and conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">In peacetime diplomacy, women already have a significant presence, as our able female colleagues here attest to. However, in conflict prevention or crisis-management processes, the contributions of women are rarely discussed.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">If women have significant contributions to make in building and strengthening a new peace, they would also be effective facilitators and negotiators for preserving a peace that exists. In this regard, reiterating a point in the historic resolution, I urge that the Secretary-General appoint more women as special representatives and envoys on his behalf, and that qualified women offer their names for inclusion in the centralized roster.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">Women's role in conflict prevention may also be expanded at the local level. Training programs for women and women's groups on peace processes should include conflict prevention as well. By now, there is enough evidence to show that the communication style of women tends to be more flexible and consensus-oriented than that of men. Without carrying the generalization too far, I believe that the greater the input of women, the greater the likelihood for conflict to be averted as well as resolved.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">In closing, I would like to reiterate the strong commitment of my Government to the historic resolution, and look forward to seeing the Secretary-General's recommendations turn into action.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Andjaba</span> <span class="nation">Namibia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">When Namibia, during its presidency of the Security Council in October 2000, decided to place the issue of women, peace and security on the Council's agenda, it was well aware of the tremendous and shocking hardships faced by women in ordinary life, but even more so during times of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">We were also aware of the commendable programmes already in place to address this dire situation, such as the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action. It was however, disappointingly clear that progress was too little and too slow and that the changing nature of conflicts resulted in a deterioration in the situation of women and girls. We therefore saw the urgent need to step up efforts, and hence the Security Council debate that resulted in the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> was hailed as a landmark decision and became a strong instrument with which the rights of women and girls could be negotiated and protected. In some cases, it served as a strong deterrent to halt further violence and abuse against women and girls.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">Today, we are meeting here on the second anniversary of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and we thank you for the initiative to convene this meeting. We have before us a detailed and well-researched study on women and peace and security, and the report by the Secretary-General which highlights the major findings and conclusions of the study. I thank the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women for the excellent work on the study in cooperation with the Task Force on Women, Peace and Security. Furthermore, we commend the Executive Director of UNIFEM for commissioning an assessment, by independent experts, on the impact of armed conflict on women, and women's role in peace-building. We look forward to that assessment.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">The report before us presents in clear terms the challenges that must be addressed if progress is to be made in achieving gender equality in the area of peace and security. More important, it includes a set of useful recommendations which, if implemented, can strengthen and accelerate the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and can have a profoundly positive impact on the situation of women and girls in conflict situations and in general.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">The study and other reports show that a number of measures have been taken to implement the resolution. However, we also know that very little has been achieved in practical terms to improve the plight of women and girls, and that the odds stacked against them remain as high as ever. Women continue to be disproportionately affected by conflict. A large majority of refugees and internally displaced persons are women. They are still subjected to rape, sexual exploitation, trafficking and other forms of dehumanization, thus making them more vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases, especially HIV/AIDS. Also, women are neither sufficiently nor appropriately represented at all levels and stages of decision-making in peace processes and peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">There are unique and particular hardships faced by women and girls under foreign occupation. They have to cope with all the prejudices against women in the most inhumane and oppresive conditions. It is our hope that this issue will be addressed more comprehensively in future, and that the Security Council will one day commission a study on the plight of women and girls under foreign occupation, with a view to taking appropriate action. Similarly, we feel that it is important that an analysis be done on the impact of sanctions from a gender perspective.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">In light of what I have said, it is clear that there remains a critical need to strengthen our resolve and resources to ensure that all provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> are fully implemented. We welcome and support the Secretary-General's call for further decisive action by all concerned to ensure that the concerns of women and girls are incorporated into all our efforts to promote peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">My delegation welcomes the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, in which gender concerns were taken into consideration when genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes were defined. Also important is the fact that the International Criminal Court will have fair representation of female judges, and that there will be gender balance in all three organs of the Court.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Despite these positive developments, much more must to be done to ensure gender-sensitive justice and to address the specific needs of women. In that regard, my delegation attaches great importance to recommendations pertaining to the appointment of judges and advisers with legal expertise on specific issues, such as violations of the rights of women and girls, including gender-based and sexual violence, in future ad hoc tribunals created by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">My delegation fully supports all efforts aimed at increasing the participation of women in all aspects of peace operations, in particular at the highest levels of decision-making. Women are perfectly capable, and in many instances they possess special qualities that can be of benefit to peace operations. The full involvement of women in negotiations of peace agreements at national, regional and international levels has to become common practice.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">Furthermore, gender perspectives have to be explicitly incorporated into the mandates of all peacekeeping missions. At the same time, gender representation at Headquarters and in missions should be strengthened. In this regard, we hope that a gender unit will be established at Headquarters, in line with the recommendation of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa13">We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General and welcome his renewed undertaking to set concrete targets for the appointment of women as special representatives and special envoys in order to reach a 50 per cent target by 2015. My country is also well on its way to achieving a 50:50 ratio between men and women as soon as possible and at all levels and in all branches of Government.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa14">In order to ensure durable peace after peacekeeping operations have ended, and to prevent gender inequalities from persisting or deepening during the post-conflict period, the rehabilitation and reconstruction processes should also benefit from strong gender perspectives. The participation of women in post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction processes has to be strengthened by, among other things, incorporating women's needs in initial project appraisals and by developing targeted activities, with adequate resources, which focus on specific needs of women and girls. Multilateral organizations which provide assistance after conflict can play an important role in establishing these standards.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa15">Finally, I believe that we have all the information we need on this issue. In the first place, we have <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We have the reports and recommendations of the Secretary-General. We have the study on women and peace and security. We also have all the necessary legal instruments. We have heard, through the Arria formula, the voices of women who experience hardship on a daily basis, and we are awaiting an assessment by the independent experts.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa16">What is required now is effective implementation by all of us: Member States; parties to conflicts; the United Nations system, with the Security Council taking the lead; non-governmental organizations; civil society; and all other stakeholders. We must leave this Chamber with a renewed sense of urgency, dedication and commitment to seriously address the plight of women and girls in armed conflict and to ensure the active participation of women in peace processes and post-conflict peace-building activities.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa17">I wish to reaffirm my delegation's resolve to continue to play an active role in the efforts of the international community to achieve that goal.</p>

	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Morocco. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bennouna</span> <span class="nation">Morocco</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">I am pleased to congratulate you, Sir, on your successful presidency of the Security Council at a very difficult time. But it is by facing challenges that personalities become known, and your personal reputation has preceded you in this forum, as you have presided over other bodies with success. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the excellent report (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1154.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1154</a>) he submitted this year.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">We have before us the subject of women, peace and security, a critical topic. It is heartening to note that the Security Council  attaches the requisite importance to it and that the Council is also according increasing importance to the humanitarian dimension of conflicts, particularly to the protection of the most vulnerable persons: women, children and the elderly. That importance is fully justified, given the fact that they are also the innocent victims of and unwilling participants in conflicts throughout the world, particularly in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">Speaking before the Council, I cannot fail to mention the particularly tragic situation of Palestinian women, who face daily insecurity and a lack of means of subsistence imposed by the Israeli occupation.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">Two years ago in this forum, the international community considered in depth the problems that women face during armed conflicts and the necessary measures to address them. We also debated the duty of the international community to integrate women into all efforts to promote and maintain international peace and security. That debate culminated, as the Council will recall, in the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> within the framework of the Security Council's mandate of maintaining international peace and security, including prevention, the settlement of armed conflicts and the protection of civilians. Likewise, the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> reaffirmed the Council's firm determination to give due consideration to the humanitarian aspects of each dispute and to commit all the parties to a conflict to respect the provisions of international law, most particularly those concerning women and children.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">Unfortunately, we must note that, despite all the efforts that I have just cited, women and girls are the principal victims of armed conflicts, where they are faced -- we hear this every day -- with all forms of violence, particularly sexual violence and exploitation. In addition, women and girls are forced to participate in hostilities or to serve in camps where they are the victims of various cruelties. Sometimes, when they are subject to refugee status -- and a very important code of conduct must be formulated on that subject -- women are separated from their daughters, who undergo forced indoctrination. They ultimately serve as cheap labour, far from their families and from their homes. Moreover, the deaths and the disappearances caused by armed conflicts give extra responsibilities to women, so they are easily recruited into illegal activities such as drug trafficking and prostitution for criminal networks.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">In that respect, training personnel for peacekeeping operations is crucial in order to sensitize them to the vulnerable situation of women and girls in situations of armed conflict, in addition to a plan for gender parity in all activities of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The proposal to create the position of gender parity adviser within the Department is truly welcome, and Morocco supports it.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">In order to strengthen respect for the rights of women and girls in conflicts, it is important that peacekeeping operations integrate women into all activities so that they can make an equal contribution to the reconstruction of affected countries. Maintaining a lasting peace after hostilities is possible only if women participate fully in all negotiations and in the resulting structures. Nevertheless, the full integration of women into development requires as a precondition the strengthening of the rule of law, respect for human rights and the establishment of democratic institutions whereby women can express their concerns and their ambitions and can participate in decision-making.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">Mindful of women's valuable contribution to the development process and to the consolidation of democracy, my country took the initiative to allot a quota to female candidates for the legislative elections held in September, which enabled us to elect 35 women -- we began with two women and ended with 35, which is quite remarkable progress -- of various political viewpoints in our Parliament.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">We believe that every post-conflict reconstruction effort essentially requires the consideration of gender-specific aspects in all programmes and activities undertaken, particularly in social, educational, economic and budgetary policy, and also the strengthening of women's presence in all spheres of the State and at all decision-making levels, which would necessarily balance society.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">The international community has at its disposal an impressive legal arsenal -- it is not that there are too few laws, but sometimes that there are too many laws -- designed to protect the rights of women, to promote gender equality and to help us combat all forms of discrimination. But those laws must be implemented. The General Assembly, by virtue of its universal composition, has an essential role to play in reminding the world of all of those legal advances, which are also achievements of civilization.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa11">The Kingdom of Morocco unequivocally condemns all attacks on the fundamental rights of women and girls, particularly in wartime, and we call on all parties to conflicts to respect the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law. Any violation of those fundamental rights must be continuously denounced and opposed with the greatest vigour. We are speaking of binding rules of law that cannot be waived by referring to specific agreements or by any kind of legal hair-splitting.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa12">Those who exploit women and children in competitions for power and who sometimes use them as hostages by objectifying them for political ends will have to account for their crimes before the international community. Today, we are witnessing the globalization of certain networks that are prone to violence and sometimes to terrorism, and it is only through the rule of law, within the framework of the United Nations, that we will be able to face them, in respect for the values set out in the preamble of the Charter of San Francisco.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Morocco for the very kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of New Zealand. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. MacKay</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">New Zealand is pleased that the issue of women, peace and security is once again on the agenda of the Security Council. The debate in the Council two years ago that led to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> was a milestone, and we now welcome the Secretary-General's comprehensive study mandated by that resolution and look forward to working towards the full implementation of the constructive recommendations contained in the study. In recognition of the study's importance, New Zealand has contributed to assisting with its development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">This study highlights the particular impact of armed conflict and its aftermath on women and girls as victims of violence, including sexual violence; as refugees and internally displaced persons; as care-givers trying to provide for their families; and as the victims of an often intensified discrimination and marginalization during times of conflict. The study has rightly acknowledged the need for on-the-ground information about the particular situation of women during armed conflicts in order for the relevant agencies involved to be able to effectively deliver assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">Importantly, this study promotes the need to eliminate impunity for crimes committed during periods of armed conflict. We welcome the study's acknowledgement of the significant advances in the international legal framework -- in which gender-based crimes such as rape, enforced prostitution, trafficking and enslavement have now been recognized as war crimes, crimes against humanity and, indeed, components of the crime of genocide. New Zealand is a strong supporter of the establishment of the International Criminal Court and urges States to ensure that gender balance, as well as appropriate expertise on the human rights of women and on violence against women, is reflected in the appointment of investigators, prosecutors and judges to the International Criminal Court.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">New Zealand also fully endorses the need to involve women in the negotiation of peace agreements at all levels. We are already aware of the constructive role that women have frequently played in the development of informal peace processes, often creating a groundswell towards peace. In the Pacific region we have commended the helpful role that women played, at the grass roots level, in the resolution of the secessionist crisis in Bougainville. The role of the Leitana Women's Group, for example, received recognition from the Secretary-General for its part in the promotion of peace in Bougainville. Similarly, women's groups were actively involved in promoting peace in the Solomon Islands. Obviously, in the interests of sustainable peace, there is much to be gained from involving women in such a key decision-making process, including in the formal negotiations. We encourage the Security Council and States to take this into account.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">The need for gender sensitivity and the inclusion of women are critical elements of successful peacekeeping operations. New Zealand has long recognized the importance of involving women in our defence forces. This year, New Zealand celebrated 25 years of the integration of women into the New Zealand Defence Forces, following the disbandment of separate women's services. This has ensured that New Zealand women have participated actively in international peacekeeping operations -- for example, in the Sinai, Cambodia, Bosnia, Timor-Leste and Bougainville. In both Bosnia and Timor-Leste, women served as troop commanders. Women have comprised between 8 and 10 per cent of each New Zealand battalion group deployed in Timor-Leste, and make up a significant proportion of the air force personnel deployed there. These women are deployed in diverse roles, including crews, logistics and administration. All members of the New Zealand Defence Forces are expected to adhere to a strict code of conduct that recognizes the importance of gender equality and sensitivity to gender perspectives.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">New Zealand has also focused on the role of women in the United Nations system, particularly in the area of peacekeeping, and in our Third Committee draft resolution on the status of women in the United Nations system, submitted jointly with Canada and Australia. In that draft resolution we have called for the Secretary-General to appoint more women as special representatives, especially in matters relating to peacekeeping, peace-building and preventive diplomacy. We are pleased that the Secretary-General's study also emphasized this point.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">The study also highlights the importance of humanitarian operations, including refugee agencies, attending to the specific needs and priorities of women and girls affected by armed conflicts and displacement. We also welcome this development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">In rebuilding societies it is imperative that women are involved at every level and that the interests of women are taken into account at this critical stage of development. We have welcomed, for example, the growing participation of women in Afghanistan's political, economic and social life, particularly the inclusion of women in the Afghan Interim Administration and the establishment of the Afghanistan Ministry for Women's Affairs. We hope that Afghanistan will continue to promote and protect the human rights of women in the ongoing process of reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa09">Similarly, in Timor-Leste, the inclusion of women in the new Constituent Assembly and the recognition of the economic contribution of women are very positive developments. As clearly identified in the Secretary-General's report, we urge States and United Nations agencies to ensure that gender perspectives are incorporated into rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa10">I would like to thank you very much indeed, Mr. President, for scheduling this debate and for the opportunity to comment on this important study.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Austria. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pfanzelter</span> <span class="nation">Austria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">I am speaking today in Austria's capacity as the current Chair of the Human Security Network (HSN), an interregional group of countries also comprising Canada, Chile, Greece, Ireland, Jordan, Mali, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, South Africa, as an observer, Switzerland and Thailand. The aims of the Network are to increase awareness of human security at the political level, to add real value to the international debate and to improve the implementation of existing standards in the field of human security through concrete actions.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">The adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, on women, peace and security, in October 2000, was a landmark decision that prompted HSN countries to work on the implementation of concrete measures to ensure that the needs of war-affected women and girls are taken into account and that women are full and equal participants in all aspects of conflict resolution and post-conflict reconstruction. A concrete action undertaken in this field by the Network was the workshop on gendering human security, held in Oslo in January 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his excellent report, which highlights important aspects regarding the roles and experiences of women and girls in armed conflicts and its aftermath.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">From the point of view of the Human Security Network, I would now like briefly to focus on four issues. The first is human rights education.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">The report of the Secretary-General recognizes the need for adequate training and education in several areas, including multidimensional peacekeeping operations and reconstruction and rehabilitation processes. Human rights education is one of the two priority issues on Austria's agenda as the Chair of the Human Security Network. For its next ministerial meeting, which will be held at Graz in May 2003, Austria will draft a document regarding the principles of human rights education, as well as a manual on understanding human rights, that will contain substantive elements on the human rights of women.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">Second is the special needs of girls. The second priority of the Human Security Network this year is children affected by armed conflict, with a particular emphasis on the special protection needs of girls. A common human security network support strategy is being developed involving an alarm function, support for monitoring activities and training of monitors and rehabilitation experts for children. We welcome the Secretary-General's recommendation to increase the number of programmes for child soldiers and to fully incorporate attention to the specific situation and needs of girl soldiers.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">Third is the protection of women from sexual exploitation and trafficking. The report of the Secretary-General reflects the grave consequences of violence, including sexual abuse in the context of armed conflict, on the physical and mental health of women and girls, such as the increased threat of contracting sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS. Therefore, the Human Security Network calls on all parties to armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, and all other forms of violence in situations of armed conflict. These forms of violence clearly undermine human security, the upholding of which is a fundamental aspect of peacekeeping operations. The Human Security Network welcomes efforts to strengthen early warning capacities in this respect, including concerning the trafficking in persons.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">Fourth is the protection of and assistance to displaced women. Women and children constitute the vast majority of the world's refugees and internally displaced persons. As pointed out in the report of the Secretary-General, the differential impact of armed conflict and the specific vulnerabilities of women and girls can be seen in all phases of displacement. The Human Security Network is therefore committed to enhancing the protection of and assistance to displaced women during their displacement and upon their return to the communities of origin.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">Today's debate provides an important opportunity to evaluate the impact of armed conflict on women and girls. We need to ensure that the security and the rights of women are protected, that any violations are prosecuted and that those responsible are brought to justice. But women are not only victims in situations of armed conflict; there are also many examples of women making a critical difference in the promotion of durable peace and in creating more equitable societies in the aftermath of conflicts. We therefore share the concerns of the Secretary-General that there is an urgent need to enhance the involvement of women in peace negotiations and their participation in United Nations peace operations. We will do our utmost to identify and nominate qualified women for upcoming vacancies in this regard, and we will actively support the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women, peace, and security.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">The full text of my intervention will be distributed and I will confine my intervention to a few paragraphs.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">It gives me great pleasure to see you, Sir, presiding over the Council at this, our third open debate on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls and the role of women in peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">My delegation would wish to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his contribution to the debate and for his report on women, peace and security, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-1154.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/1154</a>. In addition, the contributions to this report and presentations on this important topic by the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, Ms. Angela King; the Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, Ms. Noeleen Heyzer; and the Inter-Agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security should be commended.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">My delegation fully associates itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Austria on behalf of the Human Security Network.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">In Africa, enhanced efforts are being made to achieve peace, democracy and development. With the launch of the African Union and its new institutions, such as the Peace and Security Council and the African Peer Review Mechanism, African leaders have acknowledged the need to strengthen the mechanisms necessary to prevent, manage and resolve conflicts and to ensure the accountability and transparency of African Governments.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">South Africa, in addition, has embarked on peace-brokering efforts to find durable solutions to the human suffering of citizens, in particular women and girls, highlighted by the interventions of President Thabo Mbeki in his capacity as Chairperson of the African Union. As an African State, South Africa plays its modest role in the Great Lakes region, particularly in Burundi. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the peace process is advancing at an accelerated pace with our facilitation of the Pretoria Agreement of 30 July 2002 between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As required by the Pretoria Agreement, South Africa is working with the United Nations to monitor and guarantee the implementation thereof.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">The African Union acknowledges that special attention should be paid to women in view of their role in and potential contribution to the peace process. It is against this background that the African Women Committee for Peace and Development was established in 1998 by the Organization of African Unity, in collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, to ensure the participation of women in decision-making and related initiatives. The Committee also serves as an advisory body to the Chairperson of the African Union on issues relating to gender, peace, security, stability and development in Africa, and works closely with the Union's Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">As an example, the African Union, the African Women Committee for Peace and Development and associated organizations organized a solidarity mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in December 2001 to support the women in their preparations for effective participation in the inter-Congolese dialogue, hosted in South Africa early in 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">As we enter the new millennium, we are mindful that, while there is much hope for the regeneration of our continent in the context of the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's Development, Africa has a lot of work to do. One of the most critical of these challenges is to bring an end to the civil wars and conflicts that have ravaged our continent. We should aspire to having a genuine integration of all peoples, and more especially women, into the new era of peace, reconstruction and development on the continent. However, this is easy to say and much more difficult to implement.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">This is also a time when women and girls face danger. In conflict situations, women and girls become the targets of renewed gender-based violence, in their homes and in the streets. Another time of danger faced by women is the transition period from war to peace, when the demobilization of armies and the demilitarization of personnel take place. At a time of tension, roles are defined by the masculinity of war, with little emphasis on the human rights of women and girls. That approach is not easily resolved during periods of ceasefire and transition, especially if the conflict has been brutal.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">The goals outlined in the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) are consistent with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. For example, both prioritized combating HIV/AIDS and promoting girls' education and, if successfully implemented through strategies such as NEPAD, they would be powerful examples of successes to follow in Africa. The empowerment and the education of women and girls enable them to become part of the future of their countries. They have the potential to elevate girls later in their careers and personal lives, enabling them to advocate for the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls, particularly in situations of armed conflict, and to play a role in peace-building efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">In that regard, during the past two years, the United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women organized seminars in the subregion to enhance women's capacities and skills for participation in negotiations and peace-building in Africa. That was a fruitful venture, as our women reported that they have long been seeking guidance and special expertise to enable them to make critical interventions within their specific countries in order to prevent and manage conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">The gender dimensions of peace processes and conflict resolution cannot be overlooked. Women play a critical role in addressing peace and security issues. A conscious effort is needed by Member States to ensure that women's negotiation skills are utilized. It is necessary to recognize that the objective of this debate is to work towards a society in which everyone has a role to play in creating new democratic institutions. That means insisting that there is a new partnership between men and women for peace, security and development. That partnership should be mainstreamed at all levels of society and in Government or State institutions. It is also a partnership with non-governmental organizations and civil society to advocate the importance of the role that women play in times of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa14">In conclusion, it is abundantly clear that the Security Council and, indeed, all relevant organs of the United Nations and Member States must join in a cooperative venture to face the challenges of armed conflict and global security.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa15">Women's voices and their influence in peace, security, democracy, training and development, at the national and international levels, will prove to benefit all.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa16">The report of the Secretary-General is testimony to our collective and unwavering resolve to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. My delegation believes that the 21 actions highlighted in the report will serve as a useful guide for eliminating the untold suffering of women and girls caught up in armed conflict and in ensuring the active participation of women in peace processes.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa17">Women deserve to be victors with men in building peace and security.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Pulido Santana</span> <span class="nation">Venezuela</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">I wish at the outset to express our gratitude to the members of the Council for allowing us to take the floor at this important meeting. I congratulate the President of the Council, Ambassador Martin Belinga-Eboutou, for his very positive work in conducting the proceedings of this important organ. I also wish to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General, to Ms. Angela King, Special Advisor on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women, and to the Secretariat staff who have worked on the development of this important report.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">We are pleased with the holding of this meeting, given the great importance Venezuela attaches to the item on women and the inclusion of the gender perspective in all activities aimed at contributing to the pursuit of peace and security, particularly those that relate to women's participation and their contribution to achieving sustainable development through equal opportunity, based on the understanding that those activities should also be viewed as conditions for the achievement of peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">While we note that considerable time has elapsed between the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and the recent submission of this important report, we must also acknowledge that during that time there have been new developments, and incorporation of the gender perspective has been opening up new avenues. At a time when peacekeeping operations and the treatment of armed conflict are giving greater attention to the role of women, the publication of this report is most timely and welcome. We note today that the Organization has provided more space for the gender perspective in most of the priorities reflected in the Millennium Declaration. That is an important step forward.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">Venezuela believes that gender equality and the advancement of women are topics whose treatment is the task of the General Assembly and the Commission on the Status of Women of the Economic and Social Council. However, we welcome this initiative of the Security Council to take up, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, the specific item of women, peace and security, because we understand that this initiative falls within the spirit of cooperation among the main organs of this Organization and that it is part of the broad implementation process of one of the 12 critical action areas identified in the Beijing Platform for Action, adopted by the international community in the specialized conferences on women.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">The report before us today is concise and specific in its recommendations. It is a valuable and important source of guidance for understanding the present position of women and girls as persons particularly affected by situations of armed conflict, and to identify areas that require special attention, given their status as women and girls. The report is a useful listing of the various areas in which the United Nations should expand and adopt specific measures.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">In this regard, we believe that the implementation of some of these recommendations will undoubtedly make it possible to discourage the culture of violence and discrimination against women and girls as they are gradually incorporated into the process of planning, policy-making and implementation of all peacekeeping operations, humanitarian activities and post-conflict reconstruction activities.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">In this context, and in the framework of the process of increased awareness of and greater respect for human rights, we attach particular importance to the need to provide a legal basis for offenses related to violence against women, and to the possibility of providing compensation to women and girls affected by sexual violence. We value highly the recommendations pertaining to the role of women in the reconstruction and rehabilitation stages, as well as in the processes of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, in the light of the fact that women, as active players in post-armed-conflict situations, can increase their contribution to such processes.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">Clearly, the implementation of all of these recommendations implies the strengthening of coordination and greater integration among the organs involved in all of these initiatives relating to the consolidation and maintenance of peace, humanitarian operations and reconstruction processes.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa09">We should also strengthen and pay due attention to the structures and mechanisms provided for in the framework of the United Nations that aim to ensure that the gender perspective is systematically incorporated in all activities relating to peace and security. This should include, as the Secretary-General's report repeatedly stresses, the compilation of data on various situations involving violations of the rights of women and girls, which would make possible an analysis that closely reflects the real situation, identifying those areas in which training and better preparation are needed in order to achieve the goals of the report.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa10">Against that backdrop, we regret that the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), despite its being the only United Nations organ that has a specific mandate to address gender issues and the training of women, was not consulted in the elaboration of the report of the Secretary-General. We believe that, because INSTRAW has a specific mandate in these areas, its valuable work should be taken into account and it should be strengthened, given adequate resources and enabled fully to reach its goals with respect to the role of women in the achievement of the broader goal of peace and security.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Neil</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, my delegation would like to commend you for arranging this discussion on the issue of women, peace and security, which was previously brought before the Council on 25 July this year under the presidency of the United Kingdom. This no doubt speaks to the importance which the Security Council now attaches to the gender dimensions of conflict, an aspect which for years had been overlooked.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">It has been two years since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women, peace and security, a milestone in the recognition of women's contribution to the maintenance and promotion of peace and security and in addressing their specific concerns, particularly in the context of armed conflict. My delegation was therefore pleased to receive the recently completed study on women, peace and security and expresses its appreciation to the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, Ms. Angela King, for her role as coordinator, as well as to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security. We also look forward to the assessment report which will be produced by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) on women in peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">The second anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> is an opportune moment for a critical analysis of how far we have come in implementing its goals. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> is a yardstick by which the Security Council is held accountable to the international community at large in its efforts to effect change; its effectiveness is integrally related to the extent to which it is being operationalized.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">In this regard, Jamaica supports the proposal made by the delegation of Colombia for a plan of action for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">I will elaborate on a few aspects of the report which my delegation deems to be of particular importance.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">First, the international legal framework for women's human rights is crucial in ensuring their protection, especially in relation to crimes against women and girls during armed conflict. The report states that over the past decade the international legal framework has expanded to address most of the particular crimes experienced by women in armed conflict. We note that the statutes of the two ad hoc international Tribunals in Yugoslavia and Rwanda, as well as that of Sierra Leone, all include gender-based violence and have issued indictments related to sexual violence. My delegation supports the recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his report and supports the view that future ad hoc tribunals created by the Security Council should include provisions which build on existing statutes and include judges and advisers with legal expertise on specific issues such as violation of the rights of women and girls, including gender-based and sexual violence.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">Turning to the question of increased participation of women in conflict resolution and peace processes, we fully support the view that the participation of women and girls and the inclusion of a gender perspective in peace processes are strategic moves in ensuring that political, social and economic institutions facilitate the achievement of gender equality between men and women. Nowhere is this more important than in post-conflict peace-building. As past experience has shown, women can make a significant contribution in promoting peace, particularly in preserving social order and educating for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">We are pleased to note that there has been some progress in this area in terms of increased awareness. The instrumental role of women's groups in brokering peace in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and East Timor are positive examples of how effective women can be in the peace process. Despite these achievements, there is still more to be done in integrating women in all stages of peace consolidation. We should even aim to go a step further by ensuring that there are more formal mechanisms which facilitate women's groups in political decision-making. As the report clearly highlights, efforts are needed to achieve greater representation in formal peace negotiations. Women's capacities as participants and leaders need to be further enhanced. We fully support the ongoing United Nations cooperation with women's groups in the field, especially through increased training, and we anticipate further recording of these achievements in subsequent reports.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">The incorporation of a gender perspective into United Nations peacekeeping operations was an important objective of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We commend the Security Council for its efforts in supporting informal peace initiatives of women's groups and networks, including the holding of Arria-formula meetings with women's representatives. While the fact that peacekeeping mandates now entail a gender dimension is welcome, we remain concerned that the institutional support at Headquarters is inadequate to meet the needs in the field. The sterling contribution of gender advisers in Kosovo, East Timor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Bosnia and Herzegovina provides a vivid example of the effectiveness of gender units, which can serve as models for the replication of such units elsewhere. My delegation therefore continues to advocate the need for adequate capacity at Headquarters to support gender advisers in the field so as to ensure the necessary sharing of policy advice and prior to their formulation, the incorporation into peacekeeping mandates, of a gender perspective.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">Finally, while we are encouraged by the positive steps taken in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, we believe that more needs to be done in making gender mainstreaming in peace operations a reality. In implementing its own resolution, the Security Council should take the lead in ensuring that in its missions to regions of conflict it makes contact with women's groups, and that their concerns be fully taken on board when considering peacekeeping mandates.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Wahab</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">The delegation of Indonesia would like to express its appreciation to you, Mr. President, for having convened this important open debate on women and peace and security, barely one week after the report of the Secretary-General was issued. In our view, this is a reflection of the importance that this subject deserves.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">Appreciation is also due to the Secretary-General for his detailed report, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, on this issue, and in particular for his 21 far-reaching recommendations towards strengthening and accelerating the implementation of the objectives contained in that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">We have come here today eager to participate in this debate, not only because of our complete faith in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and its commitment to improving the lot of women and girls during armed conflict, but because the advancement of women is accorded great importance as one of the priority national policies of Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">As a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Indonesia fully and willingly assumes responsibility for participating actively in international efforts to end discrimination against women. We have also continued to demonstrate our opposition to trafficking in women and girls and to violence against women migrant workers.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">Many of these issues are particularly difficult to deal with after conflict has already broken out, but we believe that, if policies are already in place, it is easier for the international community to deal with any violations of established law. In this connection, we agree with the Secretary-General that there is a failure on the part of the international community to convert what is already known about the impact of conflict on women and girls into specific policies and planning and implementation processes in all peace operations, humanitarian activities and reconstruction efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">While recognizing the importance of considering the efforts being made by the Secretary-General on this issue, the delegation of Indonesia underlines the fact that such efforts and those already being undertaken in the Commission on the Status of Women are mutually reinforcing.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">Similarly, not only is the contribution of women and girls in the promotion of peace and peace processes becoming increasingly important, but it is also achieving greater recognition, and my delegation is happy to observe that development. The open support of the Security Council for the involvement of women and girls, as well as for the peace-oriented grass-roots organizations in which they are playing key roles, will go a long way to enhancing their political status and relevance.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">In this connection, our delegation is of the view that the ninth recommendation for action, which calls for the full involvement of women in the negotiation of peace agreements at the national and international level, including through the provision of training for women and women's organizations on formal peace processes, merits further consideration by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">On a related issue, we offer our support for the expressed intention of the Secretary-General to establish a database of gender specialists and women's groups and networks in countries and regions in conflict. We share his encouragement, extended to Member States, donors and civil society in this regard, to provide financial, political and technical support for women's peace-building initiatives and networks. As an extension of that idea, we urge the Secretary-General, using the existing extensive network of United Nations resources, to establish such a database throughout the developing world, so that it is ready to be tapped when needed, and not only during periods of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">The commitment of Indonesia to the advancement and protection of women in times of both peace and conflict is reflected in our national policies. Towards that end, we fully encourage the progress being made in the integration of a gender perspective into all aspects of the work of the United Nations, including within the Secretariat, as well as in peace processes, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations and reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. We urge the Council to make a more conscious effort to integrate gender consciousness and perspectives into its decisions and resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">Needless to say, the contribution of all members and segments of society is required, if peace is to be maintained and conflict avoided. The involvement of women and girls is critical not only for any efforts in that direction, but also for the maintenance of the family, which remains the basic unit of society and, therefore, of social harmony. Any investment of resources in the education and protection of women is therefore an investment in the education and protection of society.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa12">Our delegation shares the view of the Secretary-General that it is essential for the international community to increase its awareness of the differential impact of conflict on women and girls and to address this issue in a comprehensive manner so as to enable it formulate a better strategy for specific responses.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa13">It is two years this week since the Security Council passed <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, a powerful, well-intentioned resolution that was received with appreciation throughout the world. The report of the Secretary-General -- called for by the Council in the resolution -- has now taken the process forward by bringing a set of 21 recommendations for action before the Council. It is our hope that the Council will move this process forward with appropriate pace and wisdom.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of India. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nambiar</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">We are pleased to see you, Sir, presiding over this meeting of the Council. The subject under discussion in the Security Council today is one of great importance, in view of the increasing number of conflicts in which women and children find themselves involved.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">Let me begin by referring to the report of the Secretary General (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1154.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1154</a>) pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, adopted unanimously in October 2000. The Secretary-General made a very pertinent point when he said that women suffered the impact of conflict disproportionately but also that they held the key to the solution of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">The various action points listed in the report provide practical recommendations that are designed to ensure the full and equal participation of women in all stages of conflict resolution, peacekeeping, peace-building, peacemaking and the reconstruction process following conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">As do many other delegations, we support the proposal to integrate gender perspectives in the planning and mandates of peace processes. We are happy to note that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations is developing concrete measures to help mainstream these perspectives into the daily work of mission components. While there have been calls for a gender balance in the composition of peacekeeping forces, we have some doubts about the overall desirability of such a move. Would it be in the interest of either peace or gender equality for women to embroil themselves in conflict, even if it were in the cause of the United Nations? We would, instead, support a greater role for women as special representatives, within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and in negotiations for settling conflict, as provided for under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">We see the logic of the establishment of gender offices or focal points in field missions. That action would undoubtedly contribute to increasing gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping missions. Also important is the inclusion of women, girls and child soldiers in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes, which could be applied to all future missions involving DDR programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">A very pertinent point about the fact that in conflict situations women and girls are the victims of all forms of violence, particularly sexual violence and exploitation, has been brought out in the report. This element in conflict situations requires careful attention, and is one in which the international community would need to seriously consider remedial measures. Reintegration of women is another important element which requires due attention. Any peace agreements under the sponsorship of the United Nations should automatically incorporate the gender perspective, including the role women play.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">While women bear a disproportionately large share of the burden of conflict, they have only a marginal say in matters of war and peace. As was mentioned in the debate yesterday, in the First World War, 80 per cent of those who died were men, while in today's conflicts 80 per cent of the victims are civilians, mainly women and children. My delegation has, in the past, drawn attention to the fact that gender imbalances in our societies, as reflected in positions of power and influence, are an important factor contributing to the existing situation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">Clearly, another reason for the increasing instances of civilian casualties in today's conflicts is the increasing number of incidents of terrorism worldwide. The attacks of 11 September 2001 were one of the worst and most manifest forms of terrorism witnessed by modern society. However, this phase of terrorism was not unfamiliar to countries such as my own or to many others. India has been the victim of unrelenting terrorism, which primarily targets women and children, for the past 20 years, resulting in almost 60,000 casualties.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">In recent months, the world has been witness to the most heinous instances of terrorism, whether in Moscow, New York, Bali, parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat or even New Delhi. The difference between incidents in many other parts of the world and those in India is that while many recent international incidents have been perpetrated by nebulous groups operating in secrecy and disclaiming State support, those in India are the product of a carefully crafted, hard-nosed strategy directed against us. Terrorism has been used to conduct low-intensity conflict aimed at soft targets, namely, women and children and unarmed civilians. That policy perhaps had served its purpose until the international drive against terrorism took root in the aftermath of 11 September and came to be enshrined in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">It must be understood that one can no longer profess to be a part of the global coalition against terrorism on the one hand and sponsor terrorism on the other. It is no longer possible to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa11">Two of the most reprehensible terrorist crimes committed recently, mainly against women and children, occurred in India. Both were attacks aimed at provoking instability, fear and the prospect of a backlash. I am referring to the Kaluchak massacre perpetrated by terrorists on 14 May 2002 in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, when three terrorists indiscriminately opened fire on the passengers of a transport bus, then moved to the family quarters of an army unit in the area and once again fired indiscriminately on army family members present on the premises. As a result, 28 civilians were killed and 35 wounded, most of them women and children. In a more recent instance designed to ignite communal violence in the state of Gujarat, terrorists entered a place of worship, systematically firing into the large numbers of peaceful worshippers on the premises, resulting in the deaths of more than 30 innocent men, women and children and the wounding of hundreds of others.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa12">The women and children in our lives assure our future. They must live in security. They must also be assured a life of dignity. At the height of the Taliban terror, a famous Pakistani poet, Kishwar Naheed, wrote a lovely poem that began "Those who felt threatened by girl children". There has to be a change of mindset regarding women and children, the girl child in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa13">While there is much talk of the need to safeguard the interests of women and children, there is less talk of cooperative efforts to ensure sustained economic growth, which alone can eradicate the poverty and deprivation which is at the root of their exclusion. The renowned economic philosopher Amartya Sen speaks of the right of people to "seek our identity as we choose". It is that identity which should be assured to all, irrespective of gender, if we are to create an environment of peace and security for all in our interconnected world.</p>
