	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms its strong support for the Facilitation of Former President Nelson Mandela, and urges all Burundians of goodwill to join in the cause of peace, democracy and national reconciliation in their country. It also calls upon all parties to cooperate fully with the Implementation Monitoring Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council looks forward to and strongly supports the 1 November 2001 installation of the transitional government in Burundi. The Security Council believes that this event, the creation of a broad-based and inclusive government, will mark a critical turning point in the Burundi peace process. It will also encourage the donors to provide additional assistance, including by honouring fully the pledges they made during the Paris Donors' Conference in December 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council calls on the Burundian parties to reach agreement swiftly on the establishment of a special protection unit entrusted solely with the police function of providing personal security for politicians returning from exile. It welcomes the convening by the Facilitation of a pre-implementation stakeholders meeting in Arusha and urges the international community to provide, on an urgent basis, support for the training and deployment of this special protection unit.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"Deeply concerned by the increase of violence recently, the Security Council recalls the urgent need to bring about a negotiated settlement of the conflict and calls upon the Facilitation, the Regional Peace Initiative for Burundi, the Government of Burundi, the signatory parties and the armed groups to devote their full attention to the achievement of a definitive ceasefire. The Security Council once again calls on the Forces pour la défense de la démocratie (FDD) and Forces nationales de libération (FNL) to suspend hostilities, to continue negotiations and to join the peace process. The Security Council believes that the installation of a broad-based government on the basis of an internationally sanctioned peace process makes armed rebellion an unacceptable means of political expression. It calls on the FNL and FDD, together with the Burundi Government, to observe strictly the rights of the civilian population and other provisions of international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council calls on all States, in particular those in the region, to cease all forms of support to the FNL and FDD, and urges all Member States to encourage the armed groups to join the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council calls on the States of the Regional Initiative to mark the installation of the transitional government by further enhancing their bilateral and regional cooperation with the new government. The Security Council believes that this cooperation is particularly important in the area of regional security and calls on the Governments of Burundi and its neighbouring States to increase their cooperation in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council expresses its concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation and calls on all parties to create the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees, and for the safe and unhindered activities of the humanitarian relief community. It also calls upon the donor community to increase their humanitarian assistance to Burundi and to accelerate its delivery."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-26.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/26</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
