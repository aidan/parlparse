	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force, documents <a href="../pdf/S-1997-365.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/365</a> and addendum 1.

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Calovski</span> <span class="nation">The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I would like to make a brief statement with regard to the draft resolution on the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) that the Council will adopt at this meeting. Before doing so, let me say how pleased I am to see you, the representative of the Republic of Korea -- a friendly country to the Republic of Macedonia -- presiding over the Security Council for this month.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Security Council for their positive attitude towards the present and future role of UNPREDEP in our region; to all the troop contributing countries for their continuous readiness to help; to the Secretary-General and his staff for their efforts to make UNPREDEP an important success story of our Organization; and, of course, to all the members of UNPREDEP for their dedication and high level of performance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of UNPREDEP for a further six months due to the present situation in the Balkans will make it clear that the Council and the international community continue to support the preventive activities needed in our region and are thus supporting the forces of peace which are struggling against the forces of destruction -- something that requires international support.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">From the start of the deployment of this preventive United Nations mission for peace, the Republic of Macedonia did its best to enable it to perform its duty successfully. I am happy to note the broad recognition of the fact that the activities of UNPREDEP and its clear message greatly helped prevent the spillover of the Balkan war towards the south, and also the fact that it has been an important factor for stabilization in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">In spite of the success of UNPREDEP and the stability of my country, the present negative developments in the region, particularly in Albania, have made the extension of UNPREDEP's mandate an obvious necessity. We are pleased that the position of my Government coincided with the recommendation of the Secretary-General to extend the mission's mandate and that this position was supported by all members of the Security Council. I am sure that this common attitude will give strength to UNPREDEP's mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The preventive tasks of the mission in the coming period will not be easier than what has been the case so far. The complex situation in our region and the difficulties in predicting precisely coming developments require the continuous and able coordination of all peace efforts in our region. In this regard, the capacity of the mission and its ability to perform the tasks it is best qualified for should be utilized thoughtfully and effectively. The mission should continue to act as an important United Nations preventive deployment force for peace in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">Let me end this brief statement by expressing the satisfaction of my Government at the Council's decision to extend the mandate of the mission. My Government will, of course, continue to support it, and will cooperate closely with UNPREDEP, as it has up to now.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">The Russian Federation agreed to the adoption of</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">the Security Council resolution to extend the mandate of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) on the basis of the recommendations of the Secretary-General. In reaching that decision, we took into account appeals to us from the leadership of Macedonia and the position of our Security Council partners. It is no secret that the initial goal of UNPREDEP in Macedonia -- to prevent conflicts in other regions of the former Yugoslavia from spreading -- has been attained. The mandate that was given by the Security Council has been successfully implemented. This is borne out by the assessments contained in the report of the Secretary-General on UNPREDEP. We note in particular that further significant progress has been made in bilateral relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">The main reason for the extension of UNPREDEP was the complicated situation in Albania, which has created additional risks in the area around Macedonia. This has resulted in the specific parameters and priorities established for the operation at this stage. The most urgent task is to work out ways for the proper restructuring of UNPREDEP, concentrating it in the area of Albania. In keeping with paragraph 2 of the resolution that the Council has just adopted, the next report of the Secretary-General should contain practical recommendations, in particular with regard to the military component of UNPREDEP, the deployment of the force and the reorganization of the mission so as to enhance the role of the civilian police, military observers and civilian elements.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa04">We expect the report to be prepared as soon as possible, taking account of the developing situation in Albania, and especially the results of the upcoming elections to be held in Albania. A realistic analysis of the functions and tasks of UNPREDEP at this stage should include the question of a speedy reduction of its military component as soon as circumstances in Albania allow.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Richardson</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa01">The United States welcomes the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) for a further six months, until 30 November 1997. We believe that UNPREDEP plays an important and highly effective role in promoting stability in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The crisis in Albania has heightened the need for UNPREDEP's continuation, but in our view there are other sources of instability and tension in the region which also reinforce the importance of UNPREDEP now. We fully support a message of sustained, undiminished international commitment to UNPREDEP and the region.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa02">This resolution to renew UNPREDEP is the product of the considered recommendations of the Secretary-General and candid discussion among members of the Council. It represents a decision on the part of the Council to proceed with a course of action which we all believe is ultimately in the best interests of the region, despite any differences among us on specific ways in which this may be most effectively achieved. Objectivity and a spirit of cooperation and compromise have prevailed in the Council on this issue. We believe this resolution will strengthen UNPREDEP's ability to carry out its difficult mission and enhance our collective efforts in the region.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Konishi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I should like to preface my remarks today by stressing the importance that the Government of Japan attaches to the maintenance of the stability of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for the peace and security of the entire Balkan region. It greatly appreciates the role that the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) has been playing in this regard by preventing conflict from spilling into the Republic across its borders.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">As we take up the question of extending the mandate of UNPREDEP, it is necessary to consider the situation in neighbouring areas and countries. Albania is of particular concern in this respect. While the situation within that country has stabilized to some degree, owing to the deployment of the multinational protection force and to the efforts of various humanitarian agencies, it is anticipated that the restoration of political, economic and social order will take some time, even after the election that is planned for late June. At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of incidents taking place along its border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, demonstrating how fragile the stability in the Balkan region is.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">The unrest and tension stemming from ethnic rivalries in Kosovo in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the difficulties in the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina are, likewise, sources of concern for the maintenance of regional peace and security, as is the situation surrounding inter-ethnic relations in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia itself.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">In view of these considerations, my delegation shares the views of the Secretary-General which are contained in his report in <a href="../pdf/S-1997-365.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/365</a>, and fully supports his rationale for the renewal of the mandate of UNPREDEP for an additional six months, until 30 November 1997. I also welcome his endeavour to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the Force, coherence in the implementation of its mandate, greater efficiency in its operations and increased flexibility in its response to changing circumstances on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">The importance that the Government of Japan attaches to the stability of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is demonstrated in the bilateral efforts it has been making to complement those of the international community. For example, in March of this year my Government extended to the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia non-project grant aid in the amount of 500 million yen, and is ready to consider the possibility of further aid in this direction.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">In conclusion, allow me to pay tribute, on behalf of the Government of Japan, to Mr. Henryk Sokalski, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General; to Brigadier-General Bo Wranker, the Force Commander of UNPREDEP; and to all the military and civilian personnel under their command for the dedication and skill with which they are carrying out their important tasks.</p>
