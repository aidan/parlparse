	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1290.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1290</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 14 November 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the signing of the Protocol of Lusaka by representatives of the Government of Angola and UNITA in Lusaka on 20 November 1994. This Protocol together with the Bicesse Accords should lay the foundation for lasting peace in Angola. Having signed the Protocol, Angola's parties must continue to demonstrate their commitment to peace through the full and timely implementation of this detailed peace agreement. Most importantly, the cease-fire required by the Protocol must be respected.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council acknowledges the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, which have been so vital in reaching this agreement. The Security Council also commends the role of the observer countries to the Angolan peace process and the constructive interventions by leaders throughout Africa. Finally, the Security Council thanks President Frederick Chiluba and the Government of Zambia, which graciously hosted these negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council notes with concern the reports that the fighting in Angola is continuing. The Council reminds the parties of the responsibility they bear to respect fully the cease-fire agreement which is to go into effect on 22 November 1994. The Security Council looks forward to a report from the Secretary-General that the cease-fire has become effective, thereby allowing the deployment of UNAVEM II military and police observers to reinforce United Nations monitoring capabilities in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council remains seized of this matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-70.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/70</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
