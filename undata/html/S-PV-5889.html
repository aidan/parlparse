<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01"> It is an honour to join the Security Council for this discussion on the United Nations role in security sector reform. This issue is of special importance with respect to the responsibility of the United Nations, and of the Council in particular, for maintaining international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">I am grateful to you, Mr. President, and to the Government of the United Kingdom for bringing us together for this important and timely debate. I also very much appreciate the tireless efforts of the Governments of Slovakia and South Africa in promoting this discussion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">This month we mark the sixtieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping. Maintaining international peace and security remains a daunting challenge for our Organization. Despite our efforts over these six decades, conflict and violence continue to pose a threat to nations and peoples. Unquestionably, Member States remain central providers of security for States and their populations. That is their sovereign right and responsibility, as is the work to reform their security sectors. It is, however, the responsibility of the United Nations to determine how we can best support Member States in delivering enduring security through effective institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">In February 2007, I addressed the Council for the first time on the issue of security sector reform (see <a href="../html/S-PV-5632.html">S/PV.5632</a>). The term is a relatively new one, but in practice the experience of the United Nations in this area goes back decades, spanning a range of activities and United Nations departments, offices, funds and programmes. As early as 1989, the United Nations was tasked with supporting a newly independent Namibia in developing preliminary structures for its armed forces. Since the early 1990s, our peace operations have assisted national authorities in establishing new policing institutions and in strengthening the capacity and integrity of defence structures.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa05">In Angola and Mozambique our mandates included support for the integration, reform and training of armed forces, and partnerships with bilateral donors in the areas of coordination and delivery. From El Salvador and Cambodia in the past to Liberia and Sierra Leone today, the United Nations has assisted parties in security reform in the context of good offices, mediation and peacekeeping operations. From Guatemala to Afghanistan and from Burundi to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, our experience in mediating and implementing peace agreements shows that if these agreements are to succeed and endure, the work to reform security institutions needs to be addressed from the outset.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa06">In other words, the United Nations has rich and varied experience in what has come to be known as security sector reform. And yet, too often, we have remained an ad hoc partner for national and international stakeholders. What has been lacking is a common framework and a coherent system-wide approach. Despite our hands-on record, we have only limited institutional structures to guide engagement on the ground. We need to strengthen our ability to provide consistent, well-coordinated and high-quality technical advice during peace processes and in peacekeeping, peacebuilding and development. We need to make our approach less piecemeal and more holistic.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa07">That is why, at the request of the Security Council and the General Assembly, I issued a report (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-39.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/39</a>) in February entitled "Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform". As many here know, it was the product of broad consultations with Member States, regional groupings and organizations, as well as research centres, academic institutions and non-governmental organizations. It was also subject to wide-ranging consultations within the United Nations system, both at Headquarters and in the field.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa08">The starting point for the report is a broad discussion of the concept, underscoring its linkages to many important processes. It makes clear that, in any context, security reform must be approached both strategically and holistically. On one level, it is a highly specialized field. On another level, it is obviously linked to budgetary questions, economic development, good governance and sound public management. On yet another level, it requires prudent, measured and consistent steps, as well as a well-functioning understanding with the full range of national stakeholders and partners.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa09">The report before the Council, therefore, defines security sector reform as a process of assessment, review and implementation, as well as monitoring and evaluation, led by national authorities. The goal is to strengthen the effective and accountable security of a State and its people, underpinned by respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa10">Allow me to underscore a few key principles that will guide our approach. These reflect the discussions of Member States in the Security Council and the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa11">First and foremost, the United Nations should engage in security sector reform at the request of national Governments, or in response to Security Council mandates and General Assembly resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa12">Secondly, Member States are the primary providers of security, and national ownership is the cornerstone of our approach. As the Security Council noted last year, "It is the sovereign right and the primary responsibility of the country concerned to determine the national approach and priorities of security sector reform" (<i><a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-3.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/3</a></i>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa13">Thirdly, the United Nations should work in collaboration with key international partners. Such partnerships are vital in ensuring expertise and resources. This is imperative already at the outset of any peace negotiation and mediation, as successful security sector reform is a necessary precursor of any peacekeeping exit strategy and, ultimately, of economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa14">Fourthly, the United Nations approach must be flexible and tailored to the individual country, region or environment. States and societies define and pursue security according to their particular context, history, culture and needs. There can be no rigid one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa15">Finally, our approach must be gender sensitive and consistent with international law, with particular attention to sexual and gender-based violence. We must help ensure that the security sector assumes its responsibility in eradicating the unspeakable epidemic of violence against women that has become the common aftermath of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa16">Member States have recognized the need for a coherent system-wide approach to security sector reform and to the need to avoid duplication by creating new frameworks. Let us therefore focus, as a first priority, on professionalizing our approach.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa17">My report proposes a number of straightforward and pragmatic measures: developing United Nations technical guideline and training in the area of security sector reform; strengthening field capacity as well as capabilities and expertise for central backstopping; enhancing coordination and delivery of security sector reform support; and establishing a compact security sector reform support unit at Headquarters, to serve the whole United Nations, in particular peace operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa18">These priorities represent the minimum we must do to enhance our performance. But, beyond these, developing effective and accountable security institutions -- including those responsible for the provision of justice -- is more than just a goal. It is our shared obligation, especially in countries recovering from conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa19">It is an obligation intricately linked to our capacity to respond rapidly and decisively in times of crisis and to address long-term perspectives. It is central to our ability to create an interrelated system of rapidly deployable capabilities, operating under the United Nations Charter. That is why I warmly welcome the Council's intention to debate this strategic issue later this month, with the participation of the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa20">I am grateful for the Security Council's commitment to our collective endeavour to strengthen the United Nations role in security sector reform.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the Secretary-General for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">At this meeting the Council will hear briefings by His Excellency Mr. Ján Kubis, Her Excellency Ms. Susan van der Merwe and His Excellency Mr. Yukio Takasu.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ján Kubis.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kubis</span> <span class="nation">Slovakia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset to express my deep gratitude to the United Kingdom presidency for organizing today's meeting on security sector reform (SSR) -- which we deem to be a critical topic for the entire United Nations system -- as well as for giving my country, Slovakia, an opportunity to address the Security Council on this topic, which we adopted as our horizontal priority during our work as a Security Council member in 2006 and 2007. I hope and believe that today's Security Council meeting will prove to be yet another useful opportunity not only to discuss this issue but also to provide new impetus and guidance in promoting it.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">I also extend my warm thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for introducing in person his report entitled "Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform" (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-39.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/39</a>) and for his valuable remarks.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Slovakia is very pleased with the comprehensive nature of the Secretary-General's report presented today and believes that it is an important milestone in systematizing and strengthening United Nations support for SSR. We are convinced that the report is a good basis for further discussions on this issue among United Nations Member States. In this context, we are pleased to note that, as expected, the report has been issued with two symbols and is thus a document both of the General Assembly and of the Security Council. We believe that both the General Assembly and the Security Council and their relevant subsidiary bodies should address the report within the scope of their prerogatives under the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Reforming the security sector, particularly in post-conflict environments, is critical to consolidating peace and stability; promoting poverty reduction and economic and social development, the rule of law, justice and good governance; extending legitimate State authority and civilian management of the security and justice sectors, centred on people's needs; and preventing countries from relapsing into conflict. SSR is often one of the most critical elements of long-term efforts to lay the foundation for peace consolidation, which could subsequently, among other things, enable the timely withdrawal of international peacekeepers. SSR is often a crucial component, if not the crucial component, of an exit strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">To accomplish this, we believe that there is a growing need for adequate capacity within the United Nations system to be able to respond more effectively to the requests of individual Member States for support in the area of security sector reform. In this context, we strongly support the recommendations of the Secretary-General to establish clear field mechanisms for the coordination and implementation of security sector reform mandates, as well as a United Nations inter-agency security sector reform support unit to provide technical guidance and training, and to promote best practices and a holistic and coherent United Nations approach to security sector reform.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Based on our experience of promoting the issue of security sector reform within the United Nations system and studying specific cases of carrying out SSR programmes, I would like to use this opportunity to highlight several security sector reform-related principles that we consider particularly crucial.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">The first is national ownership and leadership, which simply cannot be overemphasized. SSR always has to be a nationally-owned process that is rooted in the particular needs and conditions of the country in question. National authorities must be involved in all aspects and phases of SSR and must be in the lead. It is the sovereign right and the primary responsibility of the country concerned to determine the national approach and priorities of SSR.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Secondly, there is a need for a holistic, coherent and comprehensive United Nations approach to SSR. The United Nations has been involved in various SSR-related projects and activities for many years. But what is still missing is a systematic, comprehensive and well-coordinated United Nations approach to SSR. We should spare no effort in order to achieve that goal. We believe that we are on the right track, but much more remains to be done, both by the Secretariat, by other members of the United Nations family and by Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">Thirdly, there is a need to define basic United Nations principles and guidelines for SSR. As the Secretary-General rightly pointed out in paragraph 48 of his report, this could "ensure that peacekeeping operations and United Nations country teams engaged in reform receive practical guidance and assistance", which they so often call for on the ground. We believe that such principles and guidelines should be elaborated on the basis of existing best practices and lessons learned. The Secretary-General's report provides us with a very good basis and, indeed, with the outline of a framework for this. It is now up to us, the Member States, to further elaborate principles and guidelines and to achieve consensus on them.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">Fourthly, there is a need for continued United Nations capacity-building. If the United Nations wants to deliver better and to be able to adequately respond to the numerous requests that it receives from individual Member States, it needs to strengthen its own capacities and to ensure that it can deliver better and in a highly professional manner in the most critical areas. We see the path towards that goal mainly in strengthening the inter-agency approach, including by creating an inter-agency SSR support unit.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">All of that should enable us to work more actively and effectively for better coordination of all United Nations activities -- with the central role to be played by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the ground -- and of international efforts and for better management of available international capacities, linking them more closely with national SSR strategies, policies and capacities, thus reinforcing the principles of national ownership and leadership. Therefore, while the United Nations-focused measures and approaches recommended in the Secretary-General's report are not a goal per se, they would, if supported, help all of us to be more effective and successful on the ground in addressing the realities existing there.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">In February 2007, the open debate on SSR (see <a href="../html/S-PV-5632.html">S/PV.5632</a>) and the adoption of a presidential statement (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-3.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/3</a>) helped attract growing interest among Member States in the topic of security sector reform and to raise awareness about it. This was also reflected in the very positive response to the Slovak initiative to create a United Nations Group of Friends of SSR, which now has more than 30 members from all geographic regions, with various experiences in implementing SSR or supporting it in the field.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">Since last year's open debate in the Security Council, tangible progress has been achieved in introducing this issue into the agendas of relevant United Nations bodies. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations has been the first to address the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General, within the scope of its mandate, and we note with satisfaction the fruitful discussion that it held in March. It clearly demonstrated the relevance of this topic to the wider United Nations membership as well as the challenges on the way forward. We believe that another instrumental United Nations body that will play a key role in this area is the Peacebuilding Commission, which has, commendably, included security sector reform within the integrated peacebuilding strategies for the countries on its agenda. We strongly support this.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">Among the many tangible results and concrete proofs of the understanding, assistance and cooperation achieved in the realm of SSR was the International Workshop on Enhancing United Nations Support for Security Sector Reform in Africa, held in Cape Town, South Africa, on 7 and 8 November 2007, which Slovakia organized jointly with South Africa. That event and its outcome, in the form of a Co-chairs' statement, significantly contributed to the efforts aimed at developing an SSR concept within the United Nations based on specific and unique African experience. It was also very helpful in gaining a better understanding of the nature and scope of SSR among African countries, for many of which this issue is of such critical importance. The workshop was also very instrumental in ensuring a wider and more systematic approach to SSR on the part of important regional and subregional partners of the United Nations, in particular the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States and the Southern African Development Community, but also, inter alia, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. This was also shown during the subsequent joint Slovak-South African presentation of workshop outcomes at the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, on 29 January 2008.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa15">Let me also add that the Cape Town workshop was the beginning of, and an important element in, a regional and subregional approach that we have always promoted. We have also been emphasizing the importance of a bottom-up approach to SSR processes within the United Nations -- processes that must be demand-driven and must always be tailored to the specific needs and conditions of the countries or regions concerned. In our opinion, that is the best way to identify effective and functioning mechanisms for United Nations support for SSR. We hope that the Cape Town workshop will be followed by similar events in other parts of the world -- for example, in Asia and Latin America -- to which Slovakia is ready to contribute.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa16">Let me conclude by emphasizing once again the great need on the ground for increased and enhanced United Nations support for SSR. Over the past several months of our intensive engagement in the area of SSR, we have had ample opportunities to hear such calls and requests, which have come both from national authorities and from United Nations and other international representatives working on a daily basis on the ground. We also believe that, including through today's discussion, the Security Council can make further important contributions in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa17">Finally, I want to assure members that Slovakia remains actively engaged in and committed to the cause of security sector reform within the United Nations framework and elsewhere. We stand ready to continue assisting in practical terms in any way necessary. I can assure the Council and the Secretary-General of our full and continuing support in SSR-related efforts.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Kubis for his very valuable statement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">I now give the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Susan van der Merwe.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. van der Merwe</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">We thank the United Kingdom for organizing this open briefing on security sector reform (SSR) and welcome the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform" (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-39.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/39</a>). My delegation wishes to welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General in promoting security sector reform and expresses appreciation for his recommendations on the way forward. May I also join others in welcoming the participation of the Secretary-General and, of course, the presence of Minister Kubis and of the Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">As the Council is aware, Africa has been involved in practicing security sector reform in a number of countries. Our experiences point to the fact that this is not an event, but a process that requires continuous attention and political will. It is a process that is politically sensitive and that must be nationally owned. Thus, security sector reform cannot be imposed on any country or on any institution. National ownership ensures that the process is rooted in the needs and conditions of the country, because each country faces its own unique challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">Yet, national ownership, as one of the non-negotiable principles of SSR, is definitely not antithetical to external support. So whatever approach is adopted must be in context and must be country-specific. That is important because our continent has long suffered from many attempts to impose one-size-fits all solutions to security sector reform that have produced more problems than solutions. Until now, there has been a limited understanding of security sector reform that goes beyond traditional military elements and is not State-centric, but rather involves a much wider range of national actors and institutions. That, however, does not negate the fact that Member States are the primary providers of security as both a sovereign right and a responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Last year, we were very pleased and honoured to join with the Slovak delegation in hosting a seminar in Cape Town attended by many countries. At that seminar, it was made quite clear that security sector reform must of necessity meet the new concept of security that transcends the reductionist perspective that has historically and one-dimensionally equated security with the military aspect and excluded the political, cultural and socio-economic dimensions. In other words, security sector reform is an important pillar for both security and sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">The new concept of security sector reform implies an all-inclusive process that must address the needs of the people, including the needs of marginalized groups in society, in particular women. The inclusion of their perspectives and concerns in the design and delivery of security is critical. In that way, the people are responsible for making sure that the security sector is a guarantor of security and freedom rather than a threat to it.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">However, those experiences from Africa should not be construed to imply that the need for security sector reform is specific to Africa. Indeed, other countries outside the continent have also embarked on the reform of their respective security sectors. However, Africa has some unique challenges that include the general low level of economic development, the fragility and weakness of several African States and the complexities arising from simultaneous interventions of external actors.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">South Africa recognizes the importance of close partnerships with the United Nations and non-United Nations actors, in particular regional, subregional and other intergovernmental organizations, including international financial institutions and non-governmental organizations. Security sector reform is a long-term process that requires resources, energies and political will.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">The case of Sierra Leone highlights the importance of clear political commitment and leadership to security sector reform from within the country and the crucial long-term support and benefits of a wide-consultative process, while the case of Guinea-Bissau highlights the challenges associated with implementing security sector reform with severe resource constraints. Therefore, effective support that will lead to successful reform of the sector requires capacity, knowledge and sensitivity and no tension between external support and national ownership in the process.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">In fact, there is political will on the part of the partners, but the lack of coordination has undermined the effects of that political will on the ground. In the current atmosphere of a lack of coherent and coordinated approach, international partners are virtually free to determine the elements and directions of their individualized interventions and support to security sector reform. The experience of the Democratic Republic of the Congo highlights the complexities of the problems that flow from uncoordinated external support to security sector reform.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">That is precisely because there is no code of ethics or conduct and policy guidelines that are universally acceptable to international partners and agreeable to States undertaking security sector reform. It was that observation of the negative consequences of an uncoordinated approach and a lack of guiding principles that informed our partnership with Slovakia to advocate for an enhanced United Nations role in security sector reform.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">The legitimacy and global character of the United Nations give it a particular responsibility to facilitate a coordinated approach. We appreciate that the United Nations has been doing some work on security sector reform, but most of its activities in that regard have been ad hoc and without a framework to provide guidance. Fundamental to the assistance and expertise that the United Nations provides are the cooperation and consent of the State involved. We hope that the discussion here today will move us a step closer to a more coordinated approach to security sector reform.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Takasu</span> <span class="non-nation">Chairman of the Peacebuilding Commission</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">I would like to express my deep appreciation to you, Sir, for inviting me, in my capacity as Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission, to address the Council on security sector reform. My gratitude goes to the Secretary-General for his briefing and his endeavours on promoting this matter. I am also grateful to Mr. Ján Kubis, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia, for his presence here today and the leadership role of his country. The presence of Deputy Foreign Minister Van der Merwe of the Republic of South Africa is welcome.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">Ensuring security is a precondition for any peacebuilding effort in countries emerging from conflict. In order to achieve sustainable peace in such countries, it is critically important to strengthen local capacity in the security sector by carrying out effective reform with the assistance of the international community. If we fail to successfully address that important challenge, it will certainly cause a serious peacebuilding gap, which will hamper a smooth shift beyond peacekeeping activities and a gradual transition to longer-term socio-economic development in the overall peace continuum. Security sector reform has broad implications for such peacebuilding efforts as reconciliation, social integration and youth empowerment.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">That is why security sector reform is one of the high priority issues in the work of the Peacebuilding Commission. It was with that in mind that the Commission held thematic discussions on the reform of the security and justice sectors in its country-specific meetings. Throughout its work, the Peacebuilding Commission has put emphasis on ownership -- priorities to be identified by the Government and commitment to fulfilling its responsibility. In the consultative process involving all stakeholders, the Commission develops an integrated peacebuilding strategy. Security sector reform has been identified as a priority area both in Sierra Leone and in Burundi. Those frameworks and monitoring mechanisms describe the challenges faced and the commitments to be met by both the Government itself and other stakeholders locally and internationally.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">Sierra Leone has been widely viewed as an example of successful security sector reform. The Cooperation Framework contains specific commitments on the part of the Government to review the conditions and terms of service of its armed forces, to reduce the size of the armed forces, and to provide training to improve police and community relations. The report of the Chair of the Sierra Leone country-specific configuration underscores that the Government of Sierra Leone has been making impressive progress in meeting its commitments. I believe that the upcoming high-level stakeholders consultation on Sierra Leone on 19 May presents a useful opportunity to highlight security sector reform initiatives led by the Government, with the support of its international partners, including the United Nations and the United Kingdom, and to seek additional support for continued reforms.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">The Peacebuilding Commission's engagement with Burundi has focused on consolidating the important gains made to date through the reorganization of the army and the police and the demobilization of combatants. At this moment, a delegation from the Peacebuilding Commission is visiting Burundi. Recent violent clashes between the Palipehutu-Forces nationales de libération and Government security forces and the ensuing worsening of the security situation will be an important issue for discussion during the visit. I would like to emphasize that continued international support for security sector reform is critical to laying the foundation for effective peacebuilding efforts in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">With regard to Guinea-Bissau, security sector reform is identified as one of the most important peacebuilding priorities through the interaction with the Government. During the Peacebuilding Commission's visit to the country recently, the participants concurred with the view of the stakeholders on the ground that successful implementation of Guinea-Bissau's security sector reform plan published in November 2006 was key to the country's stability. The Commission is now in the process of developing an integrated strategy reflecting the priority concerns of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">As designed to address any gap in the early stage of the peacebuilding process, the Peace Building Fund plays a catalytic role in support of various security sector reform initiatives. In Sierra Leone, the Fund provided support to strengthen police capacities in the lead-up to the national elections and to improve the conditions of military barracks. In Burundi, it supported reform efforts of the national police and the intelligence services. In Guinea-Bissau, a project to rehabilitate prisons and provide support to the judiciary police is currently under consideration, to be funded through the Peacebuilding Fund.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">Allow me to now briefly offer some of my own observations on security sector reform, in the light of the experiences gained through the work of the Peacebuilding Commission over the past two years.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">First, security sector reform must be a nationally owned process. The governments concerned should lead not only the planning process but also the implementation of such reform. The commitment by national leaders to fulfilling their responsibility for such reform is essential to producing results and inducing international support.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa10">Secondly, security sector reform requires long-term, predictable and sustainable support and assistance from the wider international community. It is important to involve all national and international stakeholders from the early stages of planning in order to ensure a smooth transition from peacekeeping to recovery and sustainable development. In coordination with the efforts of local actors, United Nations agencies, individual countries, regional and international organizations, including international financial institutions, and civil society are all equipped to make various contributions to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa11">Thirdly, a coordinated, coherent and integrated approach is indispensable in addressing the multifaceted nature of security sector reform. Such reform requires the active involvement of a wide range of national and international actors with diverse expertise and specialties. It also needs to take into account its close links with such matters as the rule of law and good governance and the necessity to integrate gender perspectives.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa12">For all those reasons, I believe that the Peacebuilding Commission can make significant contributions to promoting security sector reform by providing a valuable forum for coordinated efforts by all relevant actors on the basis of integrated strategies. I would like to assure the Council that the Commission will continue to pay the utmost attention to mobilizing international support and resources for the efforts of countries emerging from conflict, based on mutual engagement, with the aim of having a real impact on the ground.</p>
