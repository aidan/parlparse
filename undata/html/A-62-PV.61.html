<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baublys</span> <span class="nation">Lithuania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">It gives me great pleasure to introduce to the General Assembly the reports of the First Committee on agenda items 88 to 105 and 121 and 129. Those reports are contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-62-381.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/381</a> through <a href="../pdf/A-62-400.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/400</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">In response to the General Assembly's appeal, the First Committee continued to fully utilize its existing resources and was able to conclude its work of the current session in four weeks, holding 25 formal meetings. The work of the Committee proceeded in a procedurally smooth, substantively constructive, more focused and action-oriented manner.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The First Committee had before it 50 draft resolutions and three draft decisions submitted for its consideration under various disarmament and related international security agenda items. One draft resolution with amendments was eventually withdrawn. Out of the 49 draft resolutions and three draft decisions adopted, 23 draft resolutions and one draft decision, or almost 46 per cent of all draft texts were adopted without a vote. As in previous sessions, the highest number of draft resolutions dealt with issues pertaining to weapons of mass destruction, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and preventing terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials. Indeed, out of the 52 drafts adopted this year, 21 draft resolutions and two draft decisions were devoted to nuclear issues -- although, again, nuclear disarmament issues were divisive and eluded consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">The disarmament calendar for 2007, although light on substantive outcomes, has been full of activity. At different multilateral forums, Member States have addressed issues that cover many important aspects of international security and disarmament. Among other things, that included the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the successful conclusion of the work of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts to Consider Further Steps to Enhance International Cooperation in Preventing, Combating and Eradicating the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, the Open-ended Working Group for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament, the panel on the fortieth anniversary of the Outer Space Treaty and the panel on the tenth anniversary of the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">Turning to the session of the First Committee, several trends strongly manifested themselves. First, in their statements delegations paid more attention to the increasing concern over the dangers posed by existing stockpiles of weapons in general and weapons of mass destruction in particular. Secondly, there was a renewed sense of urgency and a readiness to act with a high degree of cooperation on outstanding disarmament and related issues. While that was a result of the ongoing process by Member States to re-evaluate their positions on disarmament and security issues, it was equally rooted in a growing understanding of the imperatives for achieving substantive and tangible disarmament and non-proliferation measures.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">That action-oriented approach provided a background for discussions on the entire spectrum of nuclear-weapon-related issues. Member States increasingly focused on some aspects of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament that should be addressed on a priority basis in the immediate future. In the atmosphere of reasonable expectations that prevailed in anticipation of the 2010 Review Conference, Member States felt it was even more important to take a fresh look at nuclear disarmament in general, with a view to adopting new, innovative and daring approaches. A new draft resolution on decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems was notable in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">Several draft resolutions included recognition of the need for negative security assurances. Other draft resolutions that prominently reflected those concerns addressed the conclusion of a convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, reducing nuclear danger, a renewed determination towards total elimination of nuclear weapons, nuclear disarmament and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa08">A number of draft resolutions -- such as those dealing with the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East, the consolidation of the regime established by the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the South-East Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone and the nuclear-weapon-free Southern Hemisphere and adjacent area -- expressed wide support for the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones. There were also calls for the establishment of new zones as a step leading to a world without nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa09">Many delegations spoke of the opportunities within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament. As before, the draft resolution on the Conference was adopted without a vote. The draft resolution took note of the strong collective interest of the Conference to build on the increased level and focus of activities within the Conference through 2007 and to commence substantive work in 2008.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa10">Member States also expressed their strong wish to break the existing stalemate over negotiations on the fissile material cut-off treaty and over the inability of the Conference on Disarmament to take up substantive issues for quite some time. Many delegations were hopeful that solutions were within reach and that the way would be paved for the possible establishment of the relevant ad hoc committees at the Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa11">As far as other weapons of mass destruction were concerned, the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention provided an occasion to express wide support for the Convention and its implementation. States also welcomed the successful outcome of the sixth Review Conference of the States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention, its Final Declaration after a 10-year gap and decisions concerning four annual meetings and the establishment of the Implementation Support Unit for the period of 2007-2011.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa12">While retaining its traditional aspects, regional and conventional disarmament has attained a new dimension that requires decisive actions. An unprecedented number of delegations took the floor to highlight an initiative for an arms trade treaty. Many dwelled on the issues of illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, illicit brokering and cluster munitions.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa13">A great number of speakers reiterated the necessity to continue the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. The issue of international assistance and cooperation was markedly highlighted. Some States considered that the Programme of Action did not go far enough. Accordingly, calls were made to review its implementation. Most importantly, the First Committee recommended that the next biennial meeting of States to consider the national, regional and global implementation of the Programme of Action should be held from 14 to 18 July 2008 in New York.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa14">In total, the Committee adopted eight draft resolutions pertaining to conventional weapons, including on the Convention of Certain Conventional Weapons, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, anti-personnel landmines, man-portable air defence systems and national legislation on arms transfers. A new draft resolution on effects of the use of armaments and ammunition containing depleted uranium was adopted, although consensus eluded it.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa15">The First Committee also recommended the establishment, respectively, in 2009 of a group of governmental experts to continue to study existing and potential threats in the area of information security, and in 2010 of a group of governmental experts to review the operation and further development of the System for the Standardized Reporting of Military Expenditures.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa16">Before concluding my substantive remarks, allow me again to return to the issue of terrorism. As I mentioned earlier, the Committee considered and adopted by consensus two draft resolutions addressing the prevention of acquisition by terrorists of radioactive material and sources and weapons of mass destruction. Those draft resolutions signal the Committee's general agreement that the new challenges faced by the international community call for a common response. Furthermore, they reaffirm that global threats could be addressed only through multilateral and concerted efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa17">Let me now briefly turn to the reports of the First Committee and draw the attention of delegations to some additions as well as a few technical errors that have crept into the text of the following documents. First, the draft resolution referred to in paragraph 8 of <a href="../pdf/A-62-393.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/393</a> should read as <a href="../pdf/AC.1-62-L.11.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.1/62/L.11</a>*. Secondly, in the annex contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-399.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/399</a>, the meeting scheduled for Friday, 31 October, will actually take place in the morning.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa18">At this stage, I would like to draw the Assembly's attention to the fact that there are a number of mostly editorial errors in some of the reports, which will require corrections. In order to save time, I shall not dwell on them here; they will be corrected by the Secretariat in due course.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa19">Before concluding, I should like to pay well-deserved tribute to all delegations for their active participation in the work of the Committee and for their spirit of cooperation in the common search for a better, safer and more stable world. I should like to express special gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Paul Badji, Chairman of the First Committee, who, with his intimate knowledge of disarmament and international security matters and his outstanding diplomatic skills, led the proceedings of the Committee with vision and able leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa20">On behalf of the Committee and on my own behalf, let me also extend our sincere gratitude to the Committee's Vice-Chairmen -- Mr. Ricardo Morote of Peru, Mr. Bassam Darwish of the Syrian Arab Republic and Mr. Roman Hunger of Switzerland -- for their most effective contributions to the work of the Committee. I should also like to express my appreciation to Ambassador Sergio Duarte, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, and Mr. Shaaban Muhammed Shaaban, Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management, for their leadership and contributions, as well as to the Secretariat staff that assisted the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa21">Moreover, special thanks go to Mr. Jarmo Sareva, Secretary of the First Committee, whose vast experience made a significant contribution to the successful outcome of the Committee's work. After some years of absence from the First Committee, he is warmly welcomed back, although in his new capacity.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa03">May I remind members that, in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee, and that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa04">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the First Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Committee, unless the Assembly is notified otherwise in advance. That means that where separate or recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the First Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa05">Before proceeding further, I would like to draw the attention of members to a note by the Secretariat entitled "Situation reports of the First Committee on agenda items 88 to 105", which has been circulated as document A-C.1-62-INF-3-Rev.1. That note has been distributed desk-to-desk in the General Assembly Hall as the reference guide for action on draft resolutions and decisions recommended by the Committee in its reports. In that connection, members will find in column 2 of the note the numbers of the draft resolutions or decisions of the First Committee, with the corresponding numbers for action in the plenary in column 5 of the same note.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk05-pa02">I simply wanted to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the fact that a new Australian Government was sworn in on Monday of this week. Obviously, it has therefore not had adequate time to consider each of the draft resolutions to the depth that it would wish. It is therefore adopting the position of maintaining the position that the Australian delegation took on each of these items in the First Committee. Our votes today will therefore reflect the decisions that were taken by the previous Australian Government.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk05-pa03">Nevertheless, the new Government has asked that I specifically draw to the attention of the General Assembly that it is a Government that is strongly interested in, and committed to, nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. That commitment will inform its approach to issues relating to international peace and security in the United Nations and other international forums.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Klerk</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">The Netherlands voted "no" on draft resolution IX contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-391.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/391</a>, entitled "Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium".</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">We recognize the need for ongoing research on this subject and appreciate the fact that it is being discussed in the forum of the United Nations. However, the current reference in this resolution to the potential harmful effects of the use of depleted uranium munitions on human health and the environment cannot, in our view, be supported by conclusive scientific studies conducted by relevant international organizations such as the World Health Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">The Netherlands will closely monitor the results of ongoing and future research in this field, and we will carefully examine the views of Member States and relevant international organizations that can be expected to be given in response to the resolution just adopted. We are fully prepared to discuss the substance of any draft resolution that might be introduced next year with the sponsors of any such text.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khammanichanh</span> <span class="nation">Laos</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa01">My delegation has taken the floor to explain its vote on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-41.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 62/41</a>, entitled "Implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction".</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa02">Although the Lao People's Democratic Republic is not yet a State party to the Mine Ban Treaty, we support the humanitarian efforts undertaken within the framework of the Treaty and share the concerns of the international community regarding the impact of anti-personnel landmines. In that context, we have participated in the Treaty process, including various meetings of States parties, since the Treaty's inception.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa03">The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic continues to express its interest in acceding to the Treaty. However, we need additional time and resources in order to create conditions that will enable us to accede to the Convention and to meet all the conditions prescribed therein. Those conditions include, inter alia, national capacity-building and raising public awareness about the Treaty among Government officials and military personnel, as well as local officials directly or indirectly involved in the Treaty implementation process.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa04">In that connection, we cooperated with the Canadian Government in organizing a workshop for local officials in 2004 and with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines Australia Network in convening a regional youth workshop on landmines in 2006. Furthermore, we have been cooperating with the Campaign regarding its annual report.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa05">The major problem facing our country is unexploded ordnance (UXO). We are the most heavily bombed country in the world per capita; an 87,000-square-kilometre area of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, covering 15 out of its 17 provinces, remains contaminated by UXO. In addition to causing unacceptable harm and great suffering to civilians, the UXO problem has hampered the country's socio-economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa06">In that regard, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF and donor countries, a Lao People's Democratic Republic trust fund was established in 1995 and a comprehensive UXO programme was developed in 1996. Moreover, we have adopted a national strategic plan, "The Safe Path Forward for 2003-2013," which focuses on the humanitarian, social and environmental dimensions of the problem within the framework of overall socio-economic development and poverty eradication.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk03-pa07">For those reasons, our delegation voted in favour of the resolution entitled "Implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction".</p>

	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like to explain its vote on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-37.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 62/37</a>, under agenda item 98, entitled "Renewed determination towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons".</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa02">My delegation voted in favour of the resolution, after having abstained in the voting in the First Committee, because we appreciate the positive spirit in which Japan has addressed disarmament issues as well as its constructive role in the United Nations and other relevant international organizations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). During the most recent General Conference of the IAEA, Japan voted in favour of applying the Agency's safeguards in, expressing its full support for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region. Japan stressed the need for Israel to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a basis for establishing such a zone and for the application of the comprehensive safeguards regime to all States in the region, without exception. We appreciate Japan's position because it is based on respect for principle, as opposed to the double standards used by other States in addressing the issue of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa03">My delegation hopes that its change of vote will serve as a strong motive for joint action with the delegation of Japan and other delegations to improve the draft resolution before it is voted upon at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly, thus bolstering our conviction to vote in favour of it at that session.</p>
