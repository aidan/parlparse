	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa02">Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski had a long and distinguished career as a noted diplomat of his country, having served in various capacities, including as its Ambassador and as its Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa03">As President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski played a prominent role in this Organization and made a major contribution towards the achievement of the objectives set out in the Charter of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa04">On behalf of the General Assembly, I should like to convey our deepest condolences to the Government and to the people of Poland and to the bereaved family of Mr. Trepczynski.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa01">On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Poland and of the bereaved family of the President of the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Mr. Stanislaw Trepczynski, I wish to extend our warm gratitude to this body for the fitting tribute it has just paid to its former President, a prominent Polish diplomat. The nineteenth of September this year will mark the thirtieth anniversary of his election to the high office of Assembly President. Alas, he did not live long enough to observe the occasion.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa02">Stanislaw Trepczynski represented the generation in Poland which had gone through the ordeal of the Second World War and the tribulations of post-war reconstruction in the aftermath of the post-Yalta order. Throughout his life, he was a person of uncommon qualities. In many respects, he was ahead of his time. Raised and educated in the multi-ethnic and multinational environment of Poland's second largest city of Lodz, he always preached and practised tolerance in an intolerant world. His basic professional maxim was to promote dialogue and seek agreement on contentious issues.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa03">In his capacities as President of the General Assembly, Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister, Ambassador to Rome and, subsequently, President of the Polish National Committee for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Stanislaw Trepczynski made an outstanding contribution to international cooperation and to better understanding among nations in a world of grim realities. Following his retirement, he never abandoned his active involvement in United Nations affairs. He enthusiastically joined the periodic meetings of former Presidents of the General Assembly until a disabling illness took its terrible toll. Indeed, he firmly believed that the experience of the Assembly's past and future Presidents could make a long-term and sustainable contribution to improving and streamlining the functioning and effectiveness of this principal organ of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa04">Stanislaw Trepczynski will no longer be able to join fellow Presidents to call for a better and stronger United Nations. His professional legacy in defence of this Organization, however, will last and remain for posterity. The eminent French author Jean Cocteau once said that "time is a system of folds which only death can unfold". President Trepczynski's untimely death unfolded a special fold in the annals of his national and international civil service.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa05">Once again, I wish to thank the Assembly for its dignified gesture in commemorating its former colleague and a devout friend of the United Nations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk08-pa02">In keeping with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-233.pdf">General Assembly resolution 49/233</a> of 23 December 1994, the resumed session of the Fifth Committee was primarily devoted to the consideration of questions related to the financing of peacekeeping operations and peacekeeping. The Fifth Committee considered 19 issues relating to the financing of peacekeeping operations and peacekeeping.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk08-pa03">In paragraph 6 of the report contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-56-651-Add.1.pdf">A/56/651/Add.1</a>, submitted under agenda item 120 and entitled "Financial reports and audited financial statements, and reports of the Board of Auditors", particularly sub-item (a) concerning United Nations peacekeeping operations, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</div>

In paragraph 11 of that report, the Committee recommends that the Assembly adopt a draft resolution that the Committee adopted by a vote of 111 to 2. In separate votes, the Committee decided to retain the fourth preambular paragraph and operative paragraphs 3, 4 and 13.</div>

	Mr. Adam (Israel)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa01">The introduction of four politically motivated paragraphs in this draft resolution and the discussion that followed it in the Fifth Committee on that matter force my delegation to explain our vote in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa02">By now, members surely know Israel's position with regard to the incident that occurred at Qana in April 1996, in which the Hizbullah organization launched attacks on Israel from a position less than 300 metres from the United Nations camp. Hizbullah launched the attack from that particular spot knowing full well that their actions endangered civilians and international personnel in the area. Israel had warned the United Nations repeatedly of the dangers of that situation, but no action was taken, either by the United Nations or by the Government of Lebanon, to put an end to those illegal practices. The ensuing tragedy that occurred at Qana was the direct result of the fact that Hizbullah terrorists launched attacks on Israel from close proximity to the United Nations installation in complete disregard for the danger they posed to civilians located there.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa03">There is no precedent whatsoever for a particular Member State bearing sole financial responsibility for damage sustained by United Nations forces in the context of peacekeeping operations. In every other case, we have acted in accordance with the General Assembly principle of collective responsibility and absorbed such costs within the general budget for peacekeeping operations. We should not act differently in this case.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa04">Despite this obviously selective treatment of Israel, year after year these same initiatives are introduced in the administrative and budgetary Committee with the same transparent political motive -- pinning both the blame and the cost for Qana squarely on Israel. Meanwhile, the dangerous circumstances that gave rise to that incident in the first place continue to threaten regional peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa05">More than six years after the incident in Qana, Hizbullah terrorists continue to launch unprovoked assaults across the Blue Line in clear defiance of the principles of international law, Security Council resolutions and the calls of the General Assembly. On 12 March, terrorists breached the Blue Line and killed six Israelis on the northern highway. On 30 March, Hizbullah fired dozens of mortar rounds and anti-tank missiles across the Blue Line. On 31 March, four terrorists approached the security fence from the Lebanese side of the border and opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles. On 2 April, Hizbullah terrorists launched mortar, anti-tank and anti-aircraft fire from south Lebanon across the Blue Line, and a Katyusha rocket launched by Hizbullah fell just north of the city of Kiryat Shmona. On 9 April, Hizbullah terrorists fired anti-aircraft rockets, Katyusha rockets and mortar shells, and a number of civilians and military targets in northern Israel were hurt. Anti-aircraft fire was directed at civilians in the northern Israeli town of Shlomi, and a Katyusha rocket landed in the village of Ein Kuniya, causing serious damage and forcing many area residents to spend the night in bomb shelters. Provocations such as that happened at the beginning of the week. And the list goes on.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa06">So long as Hizbullah's unprovoked cross-border attacks persist, Israel has no choice but to take necessary measures in exercise of our legitimate right to self-defence. These are measures undertaken not only to defend Israel, but to help to deter a further escalation that could threaten the stability of the region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa07">The Government of Lebanon meanwhile, in clear violation of resolutions of the Security Council, refuses to fulfil its obligations to reassert its effective authority in south Lebanon and to prevent its territory from being used as a base for terrorist operations. Hizbullah enjoys virtually unhindered freedom of movement and action and is granted safe harbour on Lebanese territory, a situation that imperils not only Israeli civilians, who are the intended targets of Hizbullah, but also Lebanese civilians and international personnel in the area.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa08">Just as in the days prior to the Qana incident in 1996, Israel has repeatedly drawn the attention of the United Nations and the international community, and is doing so here now, to the danger of further escalation in south Lebanon and to the complicity of the Governments of Lebanon, Syria and Iran in funding, assisting and supporting Hizbullah's activities. Letters detailing the dangerous potential of the situation in south Lebanon have been circulated by our Permanent Representative to Member States and are posted on our Mission's Internet site. Our Foreign Minister has both publicly and privately called for action to alleviate this situation. To date, our appeals have fallen on deaf ears.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa09">Those who are truly concerned with protecting the lives of civilians and United Nations personnel, with upholding peace and security and with contributing to the peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Middle East will stop politicizing the deliberations of the Fifth Committee and will instead bring pressure to bear on the relevant authorities in the region and compel them to end their support for acts of violence aimed at civilians.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa10">Israel calls again on the Governments of Syria and Lebanon to comply with the will of the Security Council and with the principles of international law, to allow the deployment of Lebanese armed forces up to the Blue Line, to ensure the return of the effective authority of the Government of Lebanon in the area and to prevent the launching of terrorist attacks from Lebanese territory. Only through a complete repudiation of terrorist tactics, both on the ground in south Lebanon and here in the Assembly, will we be able to restore hope for the peoples of the Middle East.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa11">My delegation will therefore vote against the four one-sided, politically motivated and unprecedented paragraphs and against the whole draft resolution under consideration today regarding the budget of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). My delegation has no reservations regarding the figures for personnel and for budget allocations to UNIFIL. However, we do indeed reservations regarding the way UNIFIL fulfils its mandate. I would like to stress that Israel pays its full assessment to UNIFIL, as we do for all other peacekeeping operations, and will continue to do so.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa12">Finally, since this will be my last statement on Fifth Committee matters, allow me to thank the Secretary of the Fifth Committee, Mr. Joseph Acakpo-Satchivi, and the Deputy Secretary, my dear colleague and friend Nora Benary, who have assisted my delegation so gracefully and who have escorted me in my four years here. I wish to thank all my colleagues on the Committee and to wish them all the best and much success.</div>

	Mr. Diab (Lebanon)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your presence in the Chair. We are very proud and happy that you are presiding over our work today.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Israeli logic would have it that it is necessary to kill civilians, occupy other people's territories, dislodge and kill the original inhabitants, and bring in diaspora Jews to live there.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa03">According to Israel, this logic is justified by divine law. But seemingly, it is not logical to implement United Nations resolutions and the principles of justice and international law that have been adopted and ratified under the United Nations Charter. Among the rights recognized by the Charter, the right to national resistance against foreign occupation is paramount. We would like to remind the representative of Israel that the Secretary-General, in his recent report to the Security Council, said that continued Israeli violations of the Blue Line by land and air had reached an incalculable number and, in his eyes, constituted provocation. Furthermore, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-242(1967).pdf">Security Council resolution 242 (1967)</a> also states it is illegal to occupy territories by force. That principle is also endorsed in the Charter. Therefore, occupying the territories of others poses a threat to international peace and security and to the safety of civilians, but cannot put a halt to legal acts of resistance against such occupation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The representative of Israel tries on every occasion to involve the Assembly in a political debate when dealing with financial and legal matters. In order to prevent Israel from pulling the wool over our eyes on the matter to be voted on today, a matter on which the Fifth Committee has adopted a draft resolution, my delegation would like to clarify the principles on the basis of which it, as well as the Group of 77 and other countries that voted in favour of the draft resolution, did so: to request Israel to provide compensation to the United Nations, not to Lebanon, due to its deliberate attack against the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) camp in Qana, Lebanon, on 18 April of 1996.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa05">First of all, we would like to remind the representative of Israel that on 25 April 1996 the General Assembly adopted resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-50-22.pdf">A/50/22</a> C entitled "The Israeli military attacks against Lebanon and their consequences", the ninth and tenth preambular paragraphs of which state that the General Assembly was</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa06">"Gravely concerned ... at actions that seriously threaten the safety of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and impede the implementation of its mandate, in particular the incident that occurred on 18 April 1996 in which shelling resulted in heavy loss of life among civilians at a site of the Interim Force,"</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa07">and that it was</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa08">"Taking into consideration the statement of the International Committee for the Red Cross ... in which it firmly condemned the shelling of civilians who had taken refuge in an Interim Force base ...".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa09">That resolution characterized the attack by Israel in Qana as a unique act. The attack was condemned by the International Committee for the Red Cross. In that resolution, the General Assembly</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa10">"Considers that Lebanon is entitled to appropriate redress for the destruction it has suffered and that Israel is responsible for such compensation;" (<i>para. 7</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa11">and</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa12">"Requests the Secretary-General to dispatch a special technical mission to the area to study and prepare, within one month's time, in cooperation with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, a report on the human and material losses and damage resulting from the recent and ongoing hostilities". (<i>para. 8</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa13">Thus, Israel's criminal responsibility in attacking Qana has been made quite clear. First, it was indicated that it was a premeditated act to bomb the United Nations base in Qana. The General Assembly specifically made this point in its resolution. On the basis of the letter dated 7 May 1996 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, the matter is quite clear. The letter begins as follows.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa14">"I have the honour to transmit to members of the Security Council the report submitted to me by my Military Adviser, Major-General Franklin van Kappen, following his mission to Lebanon and Israel. My decision to send the mission was taken in the light of the tragic events that took place at Qana on 18 April 1996, in which more than 100 Lebanese civilians were killed in the headquarters of the Fijian battalion of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa15">"... As indicated in the report, while the possibility cannot be ruled out completely, the pattern of impacts in the Qana area makes it unlikely that the shelling of the United Nations compound was the result of technical and/or procedural errors. For their part, the Israel Defence Forces maintain that the incident was due to a sequence of operational mistakes and technical failures, compounded by chance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa16">"I view with utmost gravity the shelling of the Fijian position, as I would hostilities directed against any United Nations peace-keeping position. But this incident is all the more serious because civilians, including women and children, had sought refuge in the United Nations compound at Qana." (<i>S/1996/337, p. 1</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa17">It is quite clear from the Secretary-General's letter that it was a premeditated act on the part of Israel to bomb the compound in Qana. Furthermore, under international law, criminal and financial responsibility stems from this act. The Secretary-General's letter could find no justification for Israel's shelling of Qana.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa18">Furthermore, the selective nature of Israel's actions was not accepted by Lebanon, the States members of the Group of 77 or the other States that supported the resolution in the Fifth Committee. The Secretary-General made a very specific point, saying, as I indicated earlier, that he regarded the attack as being no different from any other attack against a United Nations peacekeeping site; thus Israel's claim of bias on his part is unjustified. The attribution of criminal responsibility is based on the provisions of the resolution relating to attacks against United Nations personnel, the first paragraph of which refers to premeditated crimes carried out by States parties. Israel was thus responsible for those acts, and should be judged accordingly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa19">Finally, the draft resolution adopted by the Fifth Committee, which is now before us, stipulates that Lebanon should be compensated. That issue has been dealt with in another forum. I would like to reiterate that Lebanon will continue to demand compensation and financial reparations for the crimes perpetrated by Israel against it. The United Nations should also be financially compensated, in accordance with the provisions of the draft resolution before us, which was adopted by the Fifth Committee. For five years, such resolutions have demanded that Israel make such a payment.</div>

</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa01">My delegation would like to express its satisfaction at seeing you, Sir, presiding over the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa02">As my delegation did not explain its position in the Fifth Committee, we would like to do so now. Once again, the General Assembly is reaffirming its position with regard to the responsibility borne by those who attack the United Nations. The representative of Lebanon spoke eloquently about that issue, and we fully support his statement. The bombing of the United Nations compound at Qana was a premeditated act. The occupying Power should therefore be held responsible for its actions and should compensate the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa03">Furthermore, with regard to incursions across the Blue Line, it seems strange that the representative of the Israeli occupying forces should refer to others taking such actions, while ignoring the fact that his troops cross the Blue Line day after day. The report of the Secretary-General indicates that such incursions across the Blue Line constitute dangerous acts of provocation by Israel.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa04">Anyone who follows this matter will notice that statements made by the Israeli representative in this connection are contradictory. On one occasion they claimed that Hizbullah bombed Israel from Qana and on another occasion that the bombs originated from an area 300 metres away from Qana. This indicates that the arguments used by those representatives are mere pretexts to justify their attacks on the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa05">We urge delegations to vote in favour of the paragraphs at issue and of the draft resolution as a whole so that we can send a clear and explicit message to the Israeli occupation forces that they must respect the United Nations. The Israeli operation did not stop after the bombardment of Qana. The failure to deter Israel has enabled the occupying forces of that entity to believe that the United Nations condones attacks on the safety and security of United Nations personnel. Even the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is affected: members of its staff are arrested, tortured and persecuted in other ways, even though they are working in their official capacity. The UNRWA High Commissioner and other United Nations officials have confirmed this fact in press releases.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa06">Israel showed no respect for the sanctity of Qana, which was the site of the first miracle performed by Jesus Christ. However, neither that fact, nor the fact that it served as a United Nations headquarters, deterred Israel.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa07">The Israeli representative's claim that Israel is seeking peace is contradicted by its letter dated 14 June 2002 addressed to the Secretary-General, which was circulated as a document both of the General Assembly (<a href="../pdf/A-56-983.pdf">A/56/983</a>) and of the Security Council. It tried there to distort the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-242(1967).pdf">Security Council 242 (1967)</a>. I consider it strange that the representative of the Israeli occupation forces talks about respect for Security Council resolutions, given that Israel has not abided by the provisions of any such resolutions. Even the fact-finding mission that was supposed to be dispatched to the Palestinian territories to investigate Israeli massacres was not allowed access. Israel has so far failed to implement the provisions of more than 60 Security Council resolutions. The reason for that failure is quite clear. Israel has demonstrated its disrespect for those resolutions and for that body.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa08">The views expressed by the Prime Minister of Israel in The New York Times provide further evidence that that entity has no desire for peace. Those views run counter to United Nations principles.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa09">Once again, that entity is violating all international resolutions. It does not hesitate to violate holy places and to prevent others from exercising their right to resistance and to getting rid of that dirty occupying force. All those who oppose its policies, it accuses of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa10">When the Israeli Government declares that it desires peace and implements the relevant Security Council and other United Nations resolutions, that will undoubtedly be the right way to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region that takes into consideration the legitimate rights of its inhabitants.</div>

We oppose <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-214.pdf">General Assembly resolution 56/214</a> and similar earlier resolutions because they contain sections which require a Member State to pay for costs associated with United Nations peacekeeping operations. Those resolutions were not consensus resolutions.</div>

This procedure has been applied in the past with regard to the Middle East and continues for peacekeeping-related damage claims in the Balkans. Using a funding resolution to legislate a settlement is inappropriate. It also politicizes the work of the General Assembly's Fifth Committee, and should be avoided both now and in the future.</div>
