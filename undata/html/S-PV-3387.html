	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">&quot;The Security Council recalls its statement of 25 May 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-26.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/26</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">&quot;The Council reiterates the urgent need for a comprehensive cessation of hostilities throughout the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and calls upon the parties to resume, without preconditions, serious efforts to reach a political settlement. In that regard, it fully supports efforts by the Secretary-General's Special Representative and the UNPROFOR Force Commander to negotiate such a cessation of hostilities, and welcomes the decision to convene a meeting with the parties in Geneva on 2 June 1994. It also welcomes the reported decision of the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Bosnian Serb party to attend that meeting. The Council strongly encourages the parties to negotiate in good faith, so that a cessation of hostilities can be agreed to as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;To that end, the Security Council strongly demands immediate, full, and unconditional compliance with its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-913(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 913 (1994)</a>, and in this context endorses the efforts made by UNPROFOR to ensure the implementation of this resolution. It calls upon both parties to cooperate fully with UNPROFOR in these efforts.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-29.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/29</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
