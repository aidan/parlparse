Members are aware that, pursuant to section 1, paragraph 7, of Assembly <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-40-243">resolution 40/243</a>, no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly should be permitted to meet at United Nations Headquarters during the main part of a regular session of the Assembly, unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa02">As indicated in the letter I have just mentioned, the Committee on Conferences recommended that the General Assembly authorize, among others, the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund, as well as the Working Group on the Financing of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, to meet during the main part of the fifty-sixth session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa03">Having been informed by the Secretariat that the meetings of these three subsidiary organs will begin in the first week of the fifty-sixth session of the Assembly, may I take it that the General Assembly adopts the recommendation of the Committee on Conferences for these three subsidiary organs?</div>
