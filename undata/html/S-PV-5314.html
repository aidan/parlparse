	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council affirms that the rapid appointment of a Prime Minister of Côte d'Ivoire is crucial to relaunch the peace process leading to the holding of free, fair, open and transparent elections no later than 31 October 2006, and to implement fully the road map established by the International Working Group (IWG) at its first meeting on 8 November 2005 in Abidjan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"Therefore, the Security Council expresses its deep concern at the persistent disagreements among Ivorian parties on the appointment of the Prime Minister and considers that the Prime Minister must be designated without any further delay. The Council stresses once again that the Prime Minister must have all the necessary powers and resources described in paragraph 8 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1633(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1633 (2005)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council commends the initiatives undertaken by the Chairperson of the African Union, the Chairperson of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union Mediator, and notes that their consultations with the parties signatories to the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement have been held, as provided for by the decision of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union of 6 October 2005 and by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1633(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1633 (2005)</a>. It reiterates its full support for them and urges them to expedite their efforts. The Security Council urges them to identify as soon as possible the candidate for the office of Prime Minister they deem acceptable to all parties signatories to the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, given the consultations they have held.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the IWG, endorses its final communiqué of 8 November 2005, welcomes its decision to hold its second meeting on 6 December 2005 in Abidjan, and urges the IWG to keep the Council informed of the conclusions of its work.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council commends also the continuing efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the High Representative for the elections, and reiterates its support for them. In particular, it encourages the Ivorian parties to cooperate fully with the High Representative for the elections to resolve the current dispute concerning the Independent Electoral Commission and reaffirms that the High Representative, in accordance with paragraph 7 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1603(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1603 (2005)</a>, can make all the necessary determinations in order to help the electoral process move forward.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council reaffirms its readiness, in close consultation with the African Union Mediation, to impose individual measures provided for in paragraphs 9 and 11 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1572(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1572 (2004)</a> and in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1633(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1633 (2005)</a>."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-58.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/58</a>.</p>
