Each Main Committee will receive the list of agenda items allocated to it so that it may begin its work as soon as possible, in accordance with rule 99 of the rules of procedure.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk18-pa03">Before we adjourn, I wish to recall and underline that all meetings must start on time, at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Kindly note that all Main Committees should complete their work by 29 November and that the plenary should recess by 17 December.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk18-pa04">I particularly appeal to those Committees which are habitually late to break new ground and join the rest of us in our efforts. I personally intend to ensure that we all keep to the commitment we have undertaken today. This undertaking applies to the Secretariat as well, which must ensure that all documentation is on time, whatever the circumstances.</div>
