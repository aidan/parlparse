	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II), <a href="../pdf/S-1994-865.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/865</a>. I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to documents <a href="../pdf/S-1994-889.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/889</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1994-926.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/926</a>, which contain the texts of letters dated 28 July and 3 August 1994, respectively, from the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council and to the Secretary-General, respectively.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council has reviewed the Secretary-General's report of 22 July 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-865.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/865</a>) on the situation in Angola which was submitted in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-932(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 932 (1994)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council commends the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and the three observer States to the Angola Peace Process and encourages them to continue their efforts to put an end to the destructive civil war and bring peace to Angola through negotiations within the framework of the &quot;Acordos de Paz&quot; and relevant Security Council resolutions. It urges both the Government of Angola and UNITA to offer their full cooperation to the Secretary-General's Special Representative to allow the earliest and successful conclusion of the Lusaka peace talks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;None the less, the Security Council expresses its impatience over the protracted nature of the negotiations, and warns that the peace process cannot be delayed indefinitely. The Security Council believes that a just and comprehensive peace agreement is within reach and strongly urges UNITA to demonstrate its commitment to peace and accept the complete set of proposals put forward by the Secretary-General's Special Representative and the three observer States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Security Council expresses its appreciation for the efforts of President F. Chiluba of Zambia in support of the Lusaka peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;Furthermore, the Security Council expresses its gratitude to President N. Mandela of South Africa, who offered his assistance to help the finalization of the Lusaka peace process and agrees that these helpful efforts deserve time to come to fruition.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;Consequently, the Security Council decides to defer temporarily the imposition of the additional measures against UNITA as referred to in paragraph 5 of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-932(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 932 (1994)</a>. The Security Council confirms its readiness to impose further measures against UNITA if the latter does not accept the mediation proposals on national reconciliation during the course of the month of August. The Security Council states that it will start to compile a list of such possible measures and will not tolerate further procrastination in the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">&quot;The Security Council again reminds both parties that offensive military actions threaten all of the progress that has been achieved thus far in Lusaka, and that no tactical battlefield advantage is worth the tremendous cost in human suffering that is being paid by the Angolan people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">&quot;The Security Council expresses its dismay at the actions of both parties, particularly of UNITA, which have led to deterioration of the humanitarian situation and again reminds them of their responsibility to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian supplies. The Security Council calls for the necessary steps to insure that relief flights can resume to Malange and Kuito.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">&quot;Referring to the report of the Security Council Committee (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-825.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/825</a>) established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a> concerning the situation in Angola the Security Council reminds the Member States concerned of their obligation to respond substantively to requests from the Committee for the information required regarding alleged sanctions violations and urges them to do so effectively without further delay. The matter of cooperation with the Committee by those States which have so far failed to respond satisfactorily will be taken up by the Security Council as a matter of urgency for appropriate action, if such reply is not received forthwith.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-45.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/45</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
