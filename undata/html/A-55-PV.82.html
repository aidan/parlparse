	Mr. Amer (Libya)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa01">My delegation joined the consensus on this draft resolution, but we would like to place on record that we do not accept all its elements. In particular, I would like to refer to the first operative paragraph, which welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the United Nations in assistance in mine action. Although we concur with the information contained in the report, we note that it concentrates on mines that were planted recently and does not deal with mines planted earlier, from which my country suffers. During the Second World War millions of mines were planted on Libyan territory. These mines continue to kill many people, destroy the property of many people and hamper our efforts in the field of combating desertification and expansion of agrarian reform.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa02">Nor does the report deal with the responsibility of countries that have planted mines on the territories of other countries for paying the necessary reparations or for the removal of such mines. At previous sessions of the General Assembly, we drew attention to the problems we were experiencing due to this situation. We would again like to draw the attention of the Secretary-General to this matter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa03">We had expressed hope that the United Nations would pay the necessary attention to mines planted in the past. Unfortunately, the report presented at this session does not differ from the previous reports; it concentrates only on mines that were planted recently. Therefore, we would like once more to express our concern regarding this trend. We hope that the Secretary-General will avoid such a trend in the future, that he will draw international attention to the problems posed by mines planted in the past and that he will attach as much importance to this problem as to mines that were planted recently. The mines that were planted in the past, just like those planted recently, cause many tragedies. It has become incumbent on the international community to solidify its efforts in confronting such problems.</div>

	Mr. Khairat (Egypt)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa01">The delegation of Egypt has asked for the floor to explain its position with regard to the resolution on assistance in mine action, which has just been adopted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa02">At the outset, I wish to point out that this is an extremely important subject for Egypt, as it is one of the countries most heavily affected by landmines. In fact, there are about 23 million mines and pieces of unexploded ordnance on Egyptian territory. This hampers the efforts of the Egyptian Government to develop the areas in which those explosives are found. From a practical standpoint, Egypt attaches great importance to efforts to remove landmines and to the way in which the United Nations is dealing with this issue.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa03">Additionally, landmines continue to be a legitimate means of defending a country's borders, especially countries with extensive borders. This fact has prompted Egypt and many other countries to refrain from joining the Ottawa Convention, as the Convention did not take into account the security and defence concerns of such countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa04">In the light of these considerations, the delegation of Egypt put forth a number of amendments, which are contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.51.pdf">A/55/L.51</a>. It did so in an attempt to emphasize the concerns I have referred to in connection with the problem of landmines, as well as to make it possible for the General Assembly to deal with this subject in a comprehensive and integrated manner that takes into account the concerns of all countries. It was in order to support the humanitarian objectives of the resolution and to maintain consensus that the delegation of Egypt withdrew its amendments to the resolution just adopted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa05">Those amendments included proposed changes to the sixth and eleventh preambular paragraphs, which concern the legitimacy of the responsible use of anti-personnel landmines to defend a country's borders. In that regard, we would like to reaffirm that landmines continue to be an important element for the security and defence of Egypt's extensive borders and for protecting itself from incursions, terrorism and smuggling. We had hoped those concerns would have been included in the text of the resolution.</div>

</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa01">As it has done in the case of similar draft resolutions in previous years, the delegation of Cuba joined the consensus on the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.44-Rev.2.pdf">A/55/L.44/Rev.2</a>. As is well known, since the early years of their consideration, resolutions on this question have focused on demining issues. However, their content has gradually been increased to include a much broader and more ambiguous concept referred to as "assistance in mine action". This has made the annual negotiations held prior to the adoption of these resolutions increasingly complex and intensive. What happened this year confirms this. Several weeks of intensive consultations were required to arrive at a draft resolution acceptable to all parties. The text of the resolution we have just adopted reflects overall a very delicate balance that does not allow for selective readings or qualifications of selected parts of the resolution that do not take into account its contents as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa02">Our delegation would have preferred that the resolution explicitly reflect the legitimate national security concerns associated with anti-personnel mines. Mines continue to be an indispensable weapon for the legitimate defence of many States, in particular for developing countries that do not have the necessary resources to equip themselves with alternative means of defence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Despite the shortcomings of the resolution, Cuba has supported it primarily because of its interest in contributing to every genuine effort made to eliminate the terrible effects that the indiscriminate and irresponsible use of anti-personnel landmines are having on the civilian populations of many countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa04">I would like to conclude by conveying our appreciation to the sponsors of the resolution and to all the delegations that took part in the consultations for their spirit of compromise and the flexibility they demonstrated. That spirit made it possible to conclude successfully the consideration of this question today.</div>
