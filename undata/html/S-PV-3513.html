	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached during its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Somalia submitted in pursuance of paragraph 13 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-954(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 954 (1994)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-231.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/231</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">"The Security Council has considered carefully the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Somalia dated 28 March 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-231.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/231</a>) and notes the successful conclusion of the withdrawal of UNOSOM II forces from Somalia. It expresses its appreciation to those Governments and agencies that have provided the personnel, humanitarian assistance and other support to the peace-keeping operation in Somalia, including those Governments which participated in the multinational operation for UNOSOM's withdrawal. It pays tribute in particular to all personnel who sacrificed their lives in this service.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">"The Security Council underlines that the timely intervention of UNOSOM II and the humanitarian assistance given to Somalia helped to save many lives and much property, mitigate general suffering and contributed to the search for peace in Somalia. The Council notes that, over the past three years, the United Nations and the international community have made significant efforts to restore peace and stability and facilitate the re-emergence of a civil society. However, the continuing lack of progress in the peace process and in national reconciliation, in particular the lack of sufficient cooperation from the Somali parties over security issues, undermined the United Nations objectives in Somalia and prevented the continuation of UNOSOM II mandate beyond 31 March 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">"The Security Council believes that the Somalia operation provides important lessons for the theory and practice of peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">"The Security Council remains convinced that only a genuinely representative and broad-based approach to reconciliation will bring about a lasting political settlement and allow for the re-emergence of a civil society in Somalia. The Council reaffirms, based on its experience in UNOSOM II, that the people of Somalia bear the ultimate responsibility for achieving national reconciliation and restoring peace to Somalia. The international community can only facilitate, encourage and assist the process, but not try to impose any particular solution on it. The Council, therefore, calls upon the Somali parties to pursue national reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the interest of peace, security and development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">"The Security Council notes the recent agreements reached between the factions in Mogadishu, especially on the control of sea and airport facilities. It expresses the hope that this encouraging development is indicative of a new spirit of cooperation among the factions and that it will lead to further progress in the search for a lasting peace in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa09">"The Security Council supports the view of the Secretary-General that Somalia should not be abandoned by the United Nations, which will continue to assist the Somali people to achieve a political settlement and to provide humanitarian and other support services provided that the Somalis themselves demonstrate a disposition to peaceful resolution of the conflict and to cooperation with the international community. It welcomes the Secretary-General's intention to continue a small political mission, should the Somali parties so wish, to assist them in coming together in national reconciliation and looks forward to the report which the Secretary-General has indicated he will forward on this matter. The Council urges close cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, in particular the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), as well as the Governments of neighbouring countries in these efforts. The Council considers it essential that the Somali parties clearly express their acceptance of such assistance and their willingness to cooperate with the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa10">"The Security Council recognizes that humanitarian assistance in Somalia is an important element in the effort to restore peace and security in the country. It is therefore important to sustain United Nations humanitarian activities in Somalia and to encourage non-governmental organizations to do likewise. However, their ability to do so will depend on the degree of cooperation and security offered by the Somali parties. The Council welcomes the willingness expressed by the international humanitarian agencies and NGOs to continue to provide rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance in areas where security is guaranteed by the Somalis. The Council stresses that the creation of a long-lasting, stable and secure environment throughout the country is vital for the resumption of large-scale activity in these fields.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa11">"The Security Council reaffirms the obligations of States to implement fully the embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Somalia imposed by paragraph 5 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-733(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 733 (1992)</a>, and calls on States, especially neighbouring States, to refrain from actions capable of exacerbating the conflict in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa12">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to monitor the situation in Somalia and to keep it informed about further developments. The Council will remain seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa13">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-15.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/15</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa14">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
