	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1010(1995).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1010 (1995)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-755.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/755</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General of 30 August 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-755.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/755</a>) submitted pursuant to its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1010(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1010 (1995)</a> of 10 August 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council strongly condemns the failure of the Bosnian Serb party to comply with the demands contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1010(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1010 (1995)</a>. The Bosnian Serb party's refusal to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) cannot but reinforce the deep concern expressed in that resolution and in previous resolutions and statements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council stresses its determination that the fate of persons displaced from Srebrenica and Zepa be established. It reaffirms its demands to the Bosnian Serb party to give immediate access for representatives of the UNHCR, the ICRC and other international agencies to such persons who are within the areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces, and to permit representatives of the ICRC to visit and register any persons detained against their will.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council also reaffirms its demands to the Bosnian Serb party to respect fully the rights of all such persons, to ensure their safety and to release them.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council reiterates that all those who commit violations of international humanitarian law will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"The Security Council takes note of the investigations which are being carried out by the International Tribunal established pursuant to its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-827(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 827 (1993)</a>. The Council reiterates in this context that all States shall cooperate fully with the Tribunal and its organs, including by providing access to sites the Tribunal deems important for its investigations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts and to report to the Council no later than 6 October 1995 regarding compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1010(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1010 (1995)</a> and any further relevant information that may become available.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">"The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-43.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/43</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
