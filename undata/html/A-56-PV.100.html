	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa01">Before turning to the item on the agenda for this morning, the General Assembly will pay tribute to the memory of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Nanven Garba, President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session, who passed away last Saturday.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa02">Before serving a distinguished term as President of the General Assembly, Mr. Garba, an accomplished diplomat and a former Minister for Foreign Affairs of his country, Nigeria, had a long and outstanding association with the United Nations. As the chief delegate of Nigeria to the United Nations in the 1980s, Mr. Garba also served as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid from 1984 to 1989, providing vigorous leadership in the worldwide campaign against apartheid in South Africa.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa03">Mr. Garba will be remembered for the prominent roles he played in the Organization and for the major contributions he made towards the achievement of the objectives set out in the Charter of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa04">On behalf of the General Assembly, I should like to convey to the bereaved family of Mr. Garba and to the Government and the people of Nigeria our deepest condolences.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa05">I now invite members of the Assembly to stand and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of the late former President of the General Assembly, Mr. Joseph Nanven Garba.</div>

	Mr. Ndekhedekhe (Nigeria)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa01">I wish to express profound appreciation that it is under your able leadership, Sir, that this meeting of the General Assembly is paying tribute this morning to the memory of Ambassador Garba.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa02">On behalf of the people and the Government of Nigeria, let me express deep appreciation to the various delegations, personalities and others who, in various ways, have shown their sense of loss and expressed their condolences since the death of General Garba on Saturday, 1 June 2002, after a brief illness. Let me also express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his kind words of condolence conveyed to the family of the late Ambassador Garba and to the people of Nigeria. In addition, I should like to acknowledge and to express my appreciation for the kind words expressed in tribute to Ambassador Garba by the President of the Security Council yesterday on behalf of that body.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa03">The late Ambassador Garba was a rare personality. He devoted his life to serving his country, Africa and the international community. That was why he spent most of his time resolving conflicts, especially in Africa. And although some of those conflicts still remain flashpoints of concern today, nevertheless Ambassador Garba contributed his own quota to international peace and security. The details of his own life and accounts are ably chronicled in his book, entitled <i>Diplomatic Soldiering</i>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa04">Although Ambassador Garba's discipline was soldiering, his passion was diplomacy. That enabled him to serve creditably as Nigeria's Foreign Minister and, later, as Nigeria's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. During that period, he served the General Assembly as President during its forty-fourth session. He was also Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid, as well as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement's Good Offices Committee on arbitration during the same period. It was in his capacity as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid that Ambassador Garba exhibited his doggedness and principal philosophy of purposeful support for the fight for freedom, liberty and self-determination, especially in southern Africa.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa05">It is true that today General Garba is no more, but everywhere that national and international assignments took him during his lifetime he was able to serve his fatherland and the world community with passion and commitment. Indeed, it was the same passion to serve mankind that influenced him to accept, even after his retirement, to serve as Director-General of Nigeria's prestigious National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, in Kuru.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa06">While Nigeria and other admirers of the late Ambassador Garba grieve his death, we are thankful that God gave Nigeria the opportunity to serve this body, which enabled Ambassador Garba to serve the United Nations system. We are equally grateful that this morning the General Assembly is paying tribute to one of its own fallen heroes. May God accept the soul of the departed and grant fortitude to Nigeria and the family of the deceased to bear the loss.</div>
