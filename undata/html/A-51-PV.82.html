	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa03">Under agenda item 100, entitled "Social Development, including questions relating to the world social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled persons and the family", the report of the Third Committee in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-609.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/609</a> contains, in paragraph 9, one draft resolution recommended for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa04">Under agenda item 101, entitled "Crime prevention and criminal justice", the report of the Third Committee in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-610.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/610</a> contains, in paragraph 32, five draft resolutions recommended for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>

With reference to the latter part of paragraph 4 of the document, I wish to draw to the attention of the Assembly the fact that Turkey should be deleted from the list of subsequent sponsors because Turkey is an original sponsor of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa06">Under agenda item 103, "Advancement of women", the Third Committee recommends, in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-612.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/612</a>, paragraph 25, the adoption of four draft resolutions and, in paragraph 26, the adoption of one draft decision. I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to a correction to be made to paragraph 14 (b) of the report, which falls under the discussion of draft resolution A/C.3/51/L.19, entitled, "Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat". Paragraph 14 (b) contains the text of a new operative paragraph that was added to the text of the draft resolution at the time of its introduction. In the editing process, the position of the phrases "including at the D-1 level and above" and "particularly those that are unrepresented and under-represented" was reversed. The paragraph should read as follows:</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa07">"Urges the Secretary-General to increase the number of women employed in the Secretariat from developing countries, including at the D-1 level and above, particularly those that are unrepresented or under-represented, and from countries that have a low representation of women, including countries with economies in transition."</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa08">This correction should also be reflected in the final text of the draft resolution, which appears in this report as draft resolution III.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa09">Under agenda item 104, "Implementation of the outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women", the Third Committee recommends, in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-613.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/613</a>, paragraph 8, the adoption of one draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa10">Under agenda item 105, entitled "Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, questions relating to refugees, returnees and displaced persons and humanitarian questions", the report of the Third Committee in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-614.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/614</a> contains, in paragraph 34, six draft resolutions recommended for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa11">Under agenda item 106, entitled "Promotion and protection of the rights of children", the Third Committee recommends, in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-615.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/615</a>, paragraph 23, the adoption of two draft resolutions and, in paragraph 24, the adoption of one draft decision.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa15">The report of the Third Committee on agenda item 110, "Human rights questions", is contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-51-619.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/619</a> and Addenda 1 to 5. Under agenda item 110 (a), entitled "Human rights questions: Implementation of human rights instruments", the report in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-619-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/619/Add.1</a> contains, in paragraph 27, four draft resolutions recommended for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>

I wish to draw the attention of the Assembly to draft resolution XI. After the fourteenth preambular paragraph the following two preambular paragraphs should be inserted:</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa18">"Encouraging the international community, acting through the United Nations and other international organizations as well as bilaterally, to enhance significantly humanitarian support for the people of the region and promote human rights, economic reconstruction, the repatriation of refugees and the holding of free elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina,</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa19">"Welcoming the efforts of the European Union to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and endorsing the Special Rapporteur's recommendation that economic and other aid must be made conditional on meaningful progress on human rights."</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa20">Also, the end of the twenty-first preambular paragraph should read as follows:</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa22">In operative paragraph 11, in the second and third lines, the words "free determination and full participation by" should be deleted, and the words "to participate freely and fully" should be inserted after the word "Kosovo".</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa23">I wish also to draw the attention of the Assembly to a correction to paragraph 17 of draft resolution XII. The word "in" should be inserted between the words "in the implementation of the present resolution and" and the words "its efforts for national reconciliation".</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa24">Under agenda item 110 (d), entitled "Human rights questions: Comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action", the report in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-619-Add.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/619/Add.4</a> contains, in paragraph 9, one draft resolution, and, in paragraph 10, one draft decision, recommended for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa27">Last but not least, under agenda item 12, entitled "Report of the Economic and Social Council", the report in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-608.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/608</a> contains, in paragraph 12, three draft decisions recommended for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg001-bk04-pa28">I wish to draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that the titles of the draft decisions are missing from the report. Thus, in paragraph 12 of the document, the title of draft decision I should read, "Report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People"; the title of draft decision II should be "Organization of work of the Third Committee and biennial programme of work of the Committee for 1997-1998"; and draft decision III should be entitled "Report of the Economic and Social Council".</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg004-bk20-pa01">In the Third Committee, the United States dissociated itself from the consensus in favour of this resolution, even though we supported the text, because we had certain budgetary concerns. At this time we have agreed to join the consensus on the resolution, but on the understanding that, as the budget exercise moves towards conclusion, there will be additional offsets identified that will enable the preparations for the special session of the General Assembly called for in the resolution to go forward within the level of funds that has been approved for the current biennium.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg004-bk20-pa02">We have certain reservations concerning the programme budget implications that I should like to highlight. First, we are concerned about the costs of the preparations for the 1998 special session outlined in the programme budget implications report presented to the General Assembly along with the draft of the resolution. We are also concerned that the costs of preparing the special session may restrict the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), detracting from the important work of UNDCP to deliver counter-narcotics assistance programmes.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg004-bk20-pa03">When the programme budget implications first became available, the United States and Mexico met with United Nations and UNDCP staff in New York to discuss its contents and express our concerns. The United States reluctantly dissociated itself from the Third Committee's consensus adoption of the draft resolution because those concerns were not met. Simply put, the United States could not accept any resolution that has the potential effect of increasing the United Nations budget above the established level for the current biennium -- irrespective of whether the issue is narcotics, which is a high priority, or any other issue.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg004-bk20-pa04">The programme budget implications originally stated that $290,500 in additional resources would be required during the current biennium. Even if all six expert group meetings and their associated costs of approximately $454,500 are eliminated, the Secretariat informs us that the savings associated with their elimination would be realized mostly in the form of reducing the extrabudgetary resources component of the costs. The Secretariat noted that donors had earmarked most extrabudgetary resources for the expert group meetings, and it could not assume that donors would be willing to make those extrabudgetary resources available for other general preparations for the special session. Thus, the Secretariat concluded, an additional $222,100 in new resources would have to be drawn from the contingency fund during the current biennium. We question whether the programme budget implications has been prepared at minimal cost. We also do not believe that UNDCP should absorb these costs.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg004-bk20-pa05">The General Assembly resolution invites the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) to take appropriate measures to prepare for the special session. We wholeheartedly support thorough preparations for the special session of the General Assembly, but we do not support new proposals hidden in a budgetary implications statement.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg004-bk20-pa06">The programme budget implications have not been revised sufficiently even though there is room for budgetary savings to be found, such as, but not limited to, requiring most countries to pay their own way to the meetings and reducing the length of the CND in 1997 and 1998. We believe that the amount set aside by the Secretariat for consultant fees -- $88,000 -- and general temporary assistance -- $359,000 -- should have been reduced further.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg004-bk20-pa07">We agree with the concept of the special session, but we regret that our wholehearted support cannot be given to these budgetary matters. We are disappointed that the Secretariat has thus far been unable to eliminate the programme budget implications associated with this resolution, which we solidly support.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg006-bk16-pa02">The Group decided to object to those phrases in the draft resolutions where this terminology was included because we consider this issue to be among the prerogatives of the Fifth Committee, as is specified in <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-45-248.pdf">resolution 45/248</a> B VI, entitled "Procedures for administrative and budgetary matters".</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg006-bk16-pa03">Consequently, since this position was adopted, the Group of 77 has been applying it in all forums, especially since it was confirmed during the meeting held by the Group of 77 and China at the highest level on 27 November.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg006-bk16-pa04">Nonetheless, in this very special case, in which the draft resolution entitled "Follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and full implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Programme for Action" will be adopted as it appears in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-613.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/613</a>, our Group has decided not to propose any change to operative paragraph 44.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Marrero</span><span class="nation">United States</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg008-bk12-pa01">The United States is a strong supporter of efforts to protect the world's children. We give tangible evidence of this support by contributing significantly, more than any other country, to the United Nations Children's Fund's general resources and to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg008-bk12-pa02">We strongly affirm the intent of this resolution to protect the rights and welfare of children. For these reasons, we have joined the consensus. We are not, however, prepared to endorse the changes to resolutions on children's issues previously agreed to in other forums or to endorse provisions inconsistent with the laws and customs of war as are found in the resolution before us. Nor has the United States changed its position as articulated in numerous international forums regarding age-specific restrictions on recruitment into and participation in armed forces.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg008-bk12-pa03">Concerning reservations to international conventions, the United States continues to support the language in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-1996-85.pdf">resolution 1996/85</a> on the rights of the child, which we also co-sponsored. By contrast, operative paragraph 4 of the current resolution asks States to review the compatibility of their reservations with article 51 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant rules of international law. We are not aware of other relevant rules of international law precisely on this point.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg008-bk12-pa04">With regard to the portions of the resolution dealing with children in situations of armed conflict, the United States firmly supports the efforts to bring to an end practices that are inconsistent with international norms and the laws of armed conflict. However, we also believe that the General Assembly must be extremely cautious when addressing the laws of armed conflict and humanitarian law, the development of which must take place in forums that are adequately prepared to address the complex technical issues that are involved in these questions.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg008-bk12-pa05">The following examples demonstrate some of the inconsistencies that we found in the resolution. In general, the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular article 38, paragraph 2, should have been used to clarify what is meant by "child soldiers" or "children participating in hostilities". With respect to operative paragraph 17, while the United States welcomes efforts of the African nations to reduce and eliminate the participation of children in combat, we cannot support provisions that characterize as a war crime the use of children in armed conflict in a manner inconsistent with or in a manner that is not addressed by the laws of armed conflict. Identification of war crimes must be precise in order to have the legal effect or significance that may be intended.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg008-bk12-pa06">To the extent that operative paragraph 23 refers to the hospital zones and neutralized zones contemplated by the Geneva Conventions of 1949, we support the sentiment expressed. However, the terms "corridors of peace" and "days of tranquillity" have no accepted meaning or legal effect. Concerning operative paragraph 31, the United States believes that the resolution should have used the language on sanctions agreed to at the International Committee of the Red Cross meeting in Geneva last December. Finally, the United States strongly supports efforts to eliminate exploitative forms of child labour, and we commend the continuation of those efforts.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg009-bk02-pa01">I wish simply to refer to operative paragraph 5, section I, of draft resolution II (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-77.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 51/77</a>), entitled "The rights of the child", which is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-615.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/615</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg009-bk02-pa02">In this paragraph, States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child are urged to accept the amendment to paragraph 2 of article 43 of the Convention, which would increase the membership of the Committee on the Rights of the Child from 10 to 18 experts.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg009-bk02-pa03">Exactly one year has passed since the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, held on 12 December 1995, decided to adopt, without a vote, the amendment to article 43, paragraph 2, of that Convention, proposed by Costa Rica. The decision of the Conference of States parties was adopted without a vote by the General Assembly in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-50-155.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 50/155</a> of 21 December 1995.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg009-bk02-pa04">For the amendment to enter into force, the States parties to the Convention must respond to the Secretary-General, who, as depository, consulted them through a note dated 29 March 1996. Thus far, only some 12 responses accepting the amendment have been received from States parties, while positive responses are required from two thirds of the States parties to the Secretary-General's consultation.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg009-bk02-pa05">Costa Rica therefore cordially and respectfully appeals to those States to express their acceptance of the amendment so that we may achieve our goal of providing the Committee with eight additional experts, who will undoubtedly contribute their talents to the important functions which the Committee on the Rights of the Child is exercising for the benefit of children throughout the world who are so in need of assistance.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg012-bk12-pa02"><i>(spoke in Arabic)</i></p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg012-bk12-pa03">I should like to express the views of the Egyptian Government in respect of its obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. We consistently cooperate with the Committee against Torture in a constructive and positive manner. Egypt is pleased to cooperate with all the Special Rapporteurs on this matter and to respond to any questions they may have.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg012-bk12-pa04">The Egyptian delegation does not wish to affect the consensus on the draft resolution, because we believe it is essential to put an end to all forms of torture, a priority issue for us. We must also put an end to other cruel and inhuman treatment.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg012-bk12-pa05">I cannot claim, however, that we are fully satisfied with the draft resolution. I would specifically note the paragraphs on the report of the Committee against Torture and its methods. We trust that improvements will be made at the next session. Our desire to preserve the consensus does not mean that we accept the work on the methods of the Committee against Torture. Several negative aspects were taken up in our consideration of the item. This led to certain conclusions that are not based on sound information and do not describe the actual situation accurately or precisely.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg012-bk12-pa06">As a result, a very brief note was issued with respect to Egypt's annual report. However, the legal background and evidence that Egypt submitted during its dialogue with the Committee was not fully taken into account. The Committee has yet to respond to Egypt's arguments, which are not reflected in its annual report, despite a request by Egypt to that effect. This is contrary to the spirit and the letter of article 20 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and has prompted the Egyptian delegation to explain its position in detail in a General Assembly document.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg012-bk12-pa07">Egypt has never been a State where torture is carried out regularly or systematically, as might be inferred baselessly from the report. The only exceptions are those individual cases in which suspects have been prosecuted in accordance with the law following a full investigation. The Egyptian Government has always respected the law and its authorities have given detailed responses to the Committee on these matters.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg012-bk12-pa08">In conclusion, I wish to reconfirm that the Government of Egypt does comply fully with its commitments and obligations under the international conventions to which it is party, including the Convention against Torture. We also act in accordance with the laws and Constitution of our country, not simply or exclusively in compliance with a legal obligation, but based on Egypt's beliefs in the rule of law, which is the very basis of democracy. There can be no progress or prosperity for the people of Egypt without democracy.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg013-bk13-pa02">This draft resolution was the result of a lengthy negotiating process in which Cuba participated actively. It contains no value judgement whatsoever in respect of the restructuring process of the Centre for Human Rights. This is a complicated exercise which is still in the embryonic stage and requires a thorough analysis in the bodies that have competence in this area: the Commission on Human Rights, the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly itself.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg013-bk13-pa03">The consensus achieved on this draft resolution can therefore not be used to impose conditions or to limit the role to be played by Member States in the strengthening, streamlining and simplification of the United Nations mechanism in the area of human rights in order to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness.

Cambodia, a newly independent democracy respectful of human rights, was born of a free and fair election, organized and supervised by the United Nations in 1993.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg013-bk14-pa02">As Cambodia is currently experiencing its newly found freedom, democracy and multi-party system, my Government cooperates very closely in the field of human rights with the Secretary-General's Special Representative on human rights in Cambodia, Ambassador Thomas Hammarberg. My delegation considered the Special Representative's report on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-453.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/453</a> of 4 October 1996, to be very balanced.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg013-bk14-pa03">May I further inform the Assembly that, on 17 September 1996, comments and clarifications were submitted by my Prime Minister on the Special Representative's report, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-453-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/453/Add.1</a> of 29 October 1996. My delegation encourages representatives to read the Cambodian Government's clarifications and would appreciate their support in the consensus adoption of this draft resolution. It will, indeed, help improve the human-rights image of my country, which the international community has always recommended and supported. I would further add that, over the past three years, there have been great changes and successes, including human-rights training for police officers and judges and the formation of the Parliamentary Commission on Human Rights. More improvements are on the way as Cambodia heads towards a truly open society.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg017-bk06-pa02">It has been our understanding that the culture of peace is based on the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter on respect for human rights, democracy, tolerance, dialogue, cultural diversity and reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg017-bk06-pa03">It has also been our understanding that the culture of peace seeks to promote development, education for peace, the free flow of ideas and information and wider participation of women as integral to the prevention of violence and conflicts, and to the creation of conditions for peace in its consolidation.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg017-bk06-pa04">In a word, the culture of peace, as has been and continues to be our understanding, is a trans-disciplinary project that goes beyond any single area of human endeavour. It is human rights and development; it is diversity and unity; and it is many other things which are the building blocks of peace.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg017-bk06-pa05">It was therefore quite correct -- and certainly very desirable -- that so broad and important a subject be recognized as a separate and independent item of the agenda of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg017-bk06-pa06">My delegation deeply regrets that, in the pursuit of consensus, the thrust of the resolution was blurred, if not altogether lost. I should therefore like to request, as an attempt at clarification and for the reasons stated, to have this understanding struck into the records of this meeting: The appropriate agenda item under which the question of the culture of peace, in our view, should be the "Culture of peace".</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk03-pa01">I welcome this opportunity to explain and register the position of my delegation regarding the draft resolutions before us under agenda item 110 (c) on the human rights situation in individual countries, referred by the Third Committee to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk03-pa02">Ever since its establishment, the Republic of Yemen has consistently followed a policy of respect for and observance of human rights. It adopted the democratic option and political plurality as a system and as an approach. It promulgated legislative and legal rules guaranteeing its citizens the exercise of their political, economic, social and intellectual rights and freedoms, in line with the Constitution and the laws in force.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk03-pa03">It organized the first free, direct parliamentary elections, which took place in 1993. Having completed voter-registration procedures, it is now making the final arrangements for the second parliamentary elections since the restoration of national unity, which will be held in April 1997. It has ensured freedom of party and political activities, and of the press and publishing. Yemen now has more than 20 political parties and organizations, and more than 100 independent and party newspapers. On the international level, Yemen has acceded to or ratified most international conventions on human rights. It spares no effort to cooperate with the relevant bodies in order to demonstrate its keen interest in and absolute commitment to respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and social justice.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk03-pa04">In considering the draft resolutions before us today, we note that some of them politicize the concept of human rights to the benefit of the objectives and interests of certain countries. Some of them are prejudicial to traditions, customs and greatly revered religions. In places they exhibit a conflict in the application of criteria that is based on whim, moving away from the provision of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Geneva Conventions and its Protocols, the International Covenants on Human Rights, the Vienna Declaration and other international instruments relating to human rights, demonstrating selectivity and double standards and abandoning neutrality and objectivity. In some cases, this constitutes flagrant interference in the internal affairs of countries and a violation of their national sovereignty. This could diminish the credibility of the General Assembly and jeopardize the concepts and principles of human rights and render them meaningless.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk03-pa05">On this basis, and consistent with our established position in past years, the delegation of the Republic of Yemen denounces and condemns all violations of human rights in any country without exception, and calls for respect for national sovereignty, for non-interference in the internal affairs of all countries and for respect for the traditional customs and religious culture of peoples, when considering human rights issues. We also emphasize the need to adopt uniform criteria and principles in measuring respect for human rights without selectivity or double standards, and without any politicization that might be exploited as a means of undermining certain systems. This is based on our belief that a commitment by countries to that principle will strengthen and safeguard basic human rights. This will lead to international relations on an equal footing, based on mutual respect and common interests in a world in which justice, democracy and peace prevail.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk03-pa06">The Republic of Yemen believes in the basic principles of human rights, respects them and tries persistently to safeguard them. Given its keen interest in these principles, and in order to keep its vote as objective and neutral as possible, divorced from selectivity, double standards or politicization, and to contribute to the establishment of standardized criteria and concepts to be applied without selectivity or politicization, my delegation will not participate in the voting on any draft resolutions or procedural proposals with regard to the situation of human rights in individual countries, except those that are adopted by consensus.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa02">resolution VIII in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-619-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/619/Add.3</a>, under agenda item 110 (c), entitled "Situation of human rights in Cuba". There are times in the life of an Organization when we must evaluate the events that take place there and examine their causes. These are times when we must determine whether we have acted strongly enough or whether our inaction and permissiveness have led us to tolerate policies and practices that will, in the short term, backfire on the Organization itself, on its independence and objectivity; when we must determine if what we have done or allowed to be done with impunity will work against the independence of our States, against the sovereignty that we all desire, and against our dignity as free nations.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa03">I believe that, in the past few years, as so-called globalization has advanced, we have all witnessed at the United Nations increasing attempts to wipe out the principles governing the Organization, to impose models on all nations as if they were universally valid, and to make some of its mechanisms increasingly supranational, imposing decisions on others. We are alarmed so see how industrialized countries are, increasingly, trying to set themselves up as harsh judges of the third world, which they blame for all the ills of the Earth and on which they try to impose standards that are usually alien to it.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa04">They seem to forget their historic and current responsibility to the 12 million children under five years of age who die of curable diseases; to the 200 million homeless children; to the 100 million children forced to work; and to the 1 million children engaged in prostitution. In their speeches, they omit the fact that 800 million people are suffering from hunger, and that every year 12 million people starve to death. They do not mention the 1 billion illiterate people or the 1.5 billion people who lack health care. Nor do they speak about the responsibility of the industrialized world for violence and terrorism, for the huge drug market, for the trade in human organs, for discrimination against minorities, for racism and xenophobia in these well-to-do societies, or for the irrational consumerism that is destroying the environment, and the growing and absurd social inequalities in their lavishly wealthy countries.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa05">Is not the United States, a sponsor of this draft resolution, also the country of "Indian reservations"; the country with the highest incarceration rate in the world, where the number of black people in prison is six times that of whites; the country with the largest juvenile criminal system in the world, which applies the death penalty differently according to race; where disabled people are executed; where black churches are burned, immigrants are beaten and the CIA is investigated for distributing drugs for political purposes in black communities?</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa06">Has this country not been the ultimate ally of the most bloodthirsty military dictatorships and of apartheid? Is this not the country of counter-insurgency schools that teach terrorism, political assassination and torture? Is this not the country of neo-fascist militias and abuses against Puerto Rican political prisoners?</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa07">What are the objectives of and reasons for the imposition of this barren public exercise in double standards on the General Assembly?</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa08">I believe it is evident -- even to those who, for political reasons, co-sponsored or voted in favour of it in the Third Committee -- that this draft resolution, conceived and presented by the Government of the United States, is nothing but a super-Power's act of political revenge against a small and poor country whose unforgivable sin is to have resisted for more than 35 years attempts to make it submit, yield its sovereignty, become simply another appendage of Washington -- in other words, attempts to wipe out the Cuban nation.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa09">Is this draft resolution not part and parcel of the same aggressive and illegal policy that underlies the economic, trade, and financial blockade on Cuba, a blockade against which we voted just a few days ago by an overwhelming majority?</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa10">Is it not part of the crusade unleashed by the United States Government for the purpose of setting up a holy alliance against the example of resistance and dignity of the Cuban people? Is it not another of the sordid ramifications of its domestic policy?</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa11">Cuba is proud of its history in terms of human rights. It is proud that there is not one single Cuban suffering from hunger, not one single Cuban without medical care, not one single Cuban without a school, not one single Cuban without social security.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa12">Cuba is proud of the democratic and free participation of its citizens in Government affairs and in the full exercise of their right to elect and be elected as public office-holders.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa13">Cuba is proud of the lofty values of its people, of their strong unity, of their spirit of self-sacrifice, of their ability to resist, of their dedication to work, of their ultimate decision to defend the revolution that gave them national independence and dignity.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa14">Cuba is proud to come to the General Assembly and tell the truth; to act here, in this Organization, as its conscience dictates, without double standards and without submitting to pressure. Cuba is proud that it has to explain its votes in the United Nations only to its people.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa15">Cuba is proud, in short, that it does not and will not owe its independence to anyone, because the Cuban people have shown more than once that it is ready to defend, on its own and to the bitter end, its sovereignty and the human rights it enjoys.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg018-bk05-pa16">For these reasons, the delegation of Cuba will, as always, vote against the draft resolution on this subject.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa01">I would like to explain my delegation's vote on draft resolution VII, concerning the situation of human rights in the Sudan, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-619-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/619/Add.3</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa02">Today I will speak neither about selectivity nor about the politicization of the issue of human rights. Our position is quite clear and is known to everyone. What this explanation of vote will address is these questions: Do we, the people of the United Nations, genuinely wish to address the question of human rights? Is the welfare of all human beings, regardless of their country, colour, race, religion and gender, our primary concern?</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa03">A draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Sudan was introduced for the first time during the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Today, after five years, the draft resolution on this subject persists with almost the same language, word for word in many cases. This implies that the status quo has been maintained in the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa04">Let us look at the reality. It is a well-known fact that democratic, free elections were held in the Sudan in March 1996 and were attended by regional and international observers. Some doubted that these elections would take place. The intention of the Government of the Sudan to carry out the elections was described as</p>
	<blockquote id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa05">"the only silver lining in the dark clouds of the Sudan".</blockquote>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa06">Today that silver lining has become a reality, and an elected President and Parliament lead the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa07">The first decision taken by the elected Sudanese President was the declaration of national amnesty and the release of all political detainees.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa08">Aware that the conflict in southern Sudan is at the bottom of many human rights violations in the country, the Government of the Sudan, after lengthy negotiations, concluded a peace agreement with many factions of the rebels, with those who showed the will for peace. Today they are contributing to the process of nation-building and development. The Government will continue to accelerate the momentum of peace through its own efforts and in cooperation with other regional and international initiatives.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa09">To provide relief and assistance to the affected Sudanese citizens in southern Sudan, the Government concluded the Operation Lifeline Sudan agreement with the United Nations, which is the first agreement of its kind in the history of humanity, allowing the provision of relief to the suffering people in the areas controlled by the rebels. Furthermore, the necessary permission was granted for C-130 aircrafts to airdrop relief to affected areas. To ensure the flow of information, the Government of the Sudan cooperated with the international community by receiving the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan in August 1996, and the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the question of religious intolerance in September 1996. The African Commission on Human Rights just visited the Sudan, from 1 to 7 December 1996. Moreover, the Government of the Sudan extended invitations to the Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression and to the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, which we hope will respond positively to these invitations.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa10">Furthermore, to investigate alleged human rights violations, the Government of Sudan established a committee to investigate cases of alleged disappearances, alleged slavery, alleged slave trade and servitude brought to its attention through different sources. In response to a request on 6 September 1996 by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, an investigation team was dispatched to Juba, in the southern Sudan, during the period 13 to 20 November 1996. Moreover, in response to a request by His Excellency the Commissioner for Human Rights, the Government established human rights education committees in all 26 States.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa11">Are these developments reflected in the draft resolution before the General Assembly today?</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa12">The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan has recommended in his report to this session that the General Assembly should take specific steps, including:</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg020-bk01-pa18">The answer to these questions is obvious. The great English poet Alexander Pope said</p>

We are convinced that cooperation and coordination -- and not confrontation and predetermined condemnation -- constitute the only viable path to be followed if we genuinely and sincerely want to achieve concrete results in the field of human rights in the international arena. Therefore, we will vote against this draft resolution, and we request those who share our views to do the same.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Gambari</span><span class="nation">Nigeria</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa01">One year ago, some Member States of our Organization submitted a politically motivated draft resolution entitled "Situation of human rights in Nigeria". In response, the Nigerian delegation drew the attention of this Assembly to the hasty manner in which the draft resolution had been submitted and in particular to its inappropriateness, as it was occasioned in large part by the emotions of the moment. We had thought that time had removed the emotions and that the positive actions taken by the Government since then should have convinced all that the Government is committed to the promotion of human rights and democracy in my country.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa02">My delegation would like to reiterate the commitment of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the realization of the human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the draft Constitution, enforced by an effective mechanism in our National Human Rights Commission, and also contained in the relevant instruments of which Nigeria is a voluntary signatory. It would appear, however, that some members of this Organization have a tendency to behave like the proverbial ostrich which hides its head in the sand and feels that nobody sees it because it is unable to see its own body. Ironically, some of those who live in glass houses are throwing the biggest stones on the issues of human rights.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa03">It also appears that the promotion of human rights, which is based on the principles of non-selectivity, objectivity and impartiality, is being politicized by some Members, with severe consequences for their own credibility and for the credibility of our Organization. Permit me to quote from the statement of the President to the Assembly only two days ago:</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa04">"If universality is the central tenet of human rights, universal application of their principles is the guardian of human dignity for all." <i>(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary Meetings, 78th meeting, p. 1)</i></p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa05">Unfortunately, the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in Nigeria reflects selectivity instead of universality. We believe that anyone who is genuinely interested in the affairs of Nigeria, and any objective analysis of the developments there, cannot fail to recognize the positive development and the momentum of events towards the promotion of human rights and democracy in my country.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa06">My delegation has taken several opportunities during the current session of the General Assembly to highlight the efforts made by the Government of Nigeria to implement its transition programme and to advance the promotion of respect for human rights, including the faithful implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary-General's fact-finding mission to Nigeria. Nonetheless, I will crave the Assembly's indulgence once more as I go over briefly the major actions that have been taken since <a href="../pdf/A-RES-50-199.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 50/199</a> was adopted on 22 December 1995.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa07">First, the Government's phased transition to a civil-rule programme is on course, with the registration of five political parties membership in which is open to all Nigerians; the creation of six additional States and 182 local government council areas in accordance with the wishes of the Nigerian people and as part of the effort to decentralize power and thus bring government closer to the grass roots; local government elections on a non-party basis, which have effectively established democratic governance at the local level; and the ongoing efforts to hold other elections as scheduled under the phased-transition timetable.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa08">Secondly, the Government has established an independent Commission of Human Rights, comprising eminent jurists, academics, human rights and pro-democracy activists, labour leaders and representatives of the private media, who shall be looking into complaints of human rights abuses and be making appropriate recommendations for redress to the Government. A high-powered panel has also been established to review the cases of all those detained or imprisoned under the various decrees, the ongoing review process has resulted in the release of more than 25 persons at last count. Moreover, and in response to the recommendations of the report of the Secretary-General's fact-finding mission and the wishes of the Nigerian public, the Government has abrogated, reviewed or amended, as necessary, the various decrees and acts under which some persons were detained or tried for security reasons. In particular, the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the right of appeal have been reinstituted in the procedures of the Special Tribunals. Moreover, military personnel are no longer to serve as members of the Special Tribunals, in order to make the Tribunals independent of the military authority.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa09">In the pursuit of its programme of transition to democratic rule and commitment to human rights, the Government of Nigeria has no intention to pander to the whims of any State or group of States, or to prevent them from proposing a draft resolution. It intends to abide by its obligations as a responsible member of the international community and to respect the wishes of the people of Nigeria. Nonetheless, today we are faced here with draft resolution IV, in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-619-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/619/Add.3</a>, another draft resolution on the situation of human rights in Nigeria. This draft resolution is, to all intents and purposes, not only unnecessary but also essentially a waste of the dwindling resources of our Organization. This becomes all the more clear when viewed against the background of the imbalances, inaccuracies and misinformation it contains, especially in the ninth, eleventh and thirteenth preambular paragraphs and operative paragraphs 1 and 5. We are, therefore, left with no option but to vote against this draft resolution. My delegation further appeals to all those States that are genuinely interested in the promotion of democracy and human rights in Nigeria to join us in opposing this draft resolution, because the as draft resolution as submitted does not reflect accurately the positive efforts which have been made to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as to advance the cause of democracy, in Nigeria.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg021-bk01-pa10">Finally, it is our fervent hope that this will be the very last time that the General Assembly will entertain this kind of superfluous, unfair and unbalanced draft resolution on Nigeria. Nigerians must be allowed to address their political and human rights issues without undue external pressures.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mrs. Albright</span><span class="nation">United States</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa01">The United States strongly supports this resolution on the human rights situation in Burma, and I congratulate my colleagues from Sweden for the skill and commitment with which they drafted and secured agreement to it.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa02">This resolution reflects the consensus view of the Members of the United Nations, a view premised on the ideals of the United Nations Charter and the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It reflects the hard-earned wisdom of the international community that every Government of every society should be held to certain minimum standards of respect for the rights and freedoms of its own people.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa03">Regrettably, the current Government of Burma is not meeting these minimum standards. It has subjected democratic forces to a kind of rolling repression in which small steps forward alternate with crackdowns and episodes of intimidation and violence.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa04">The Burmese authorities, known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), have refused to enter into a meaningful dialogue with the leader of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, or with other democratic leaders and representatives of the major ethnic groups. They have continued to deny their citizens the fundamental political freedoms of expression and assembly, and they have engaged in torture, forced labour, forced relocations and summary executions.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa05">It is increasingly clear that the failure of the Burmese authorities to respect civil and human rights is causing unrest within the country.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa06">Recent student demonstrations, although non-political in nature, have been harshly repressed. The Government has periodically curtailed the right of Aung San Suu Kyi to address her supporters in public and even to leave her home. Last November, her motorcade was attacked by a mob that could have acted only with official authority and blessing. As we speak, the restrictions on her movements and activities are the most severe since her release from "house arrest" in July 1995.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa07">Although the SLORC professes a desire to move Burma in the direction of democracy, it has not done so. The constitutional Convention it established to create the illusion of a national political dialogue is a sham -- fully controlled and orchestrated by the Government. As a result, the Convention has been a source not of reconciliation, but of further division.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa08">Finally, the Government of Burma has refused to cooperate with the United Nations Special Rapporteur and with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa09">The Burmese authorities would like the world to believe that its harsh policies are necessary in the light of Burma's turbulent history and the multi-ethnic nature of Burmese society. But as the resolution adopted today shows, the world does not accept that excuse. The right of people to participate freely in a democratic political process is an ally -- not an enemy -- to national unity and social peace.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa10">Experience tells us that the kind of stability that may be achieved through repression is sterile, superficial and temporary. It is a stability maintained by fear, in which the human resources of a society are held back and beaten down.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa11">Lasting stability, economic prosperity and a rich cultural life come when people are free to make use of their full talents and abilities. A society blossoms when those who govern respect those who are governed, and when the people have confidence in those they have chosen to make and enforce their laws.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa12">For Burma, the path to that kind of future is outlined in this resolution. In it, we call upon the Government to cease abusing human rights, to empty its cells of those detained for political reasons, to permit United Nations representatives to visit, and to begin genuine dialogue with democratic and ethnic leaders.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa13">The more time elapses before these steps are taken, the more the pressure will build, the more divided Burma will become, and the more difficult it will be for Burma to achieve a peaceful transition to democratic rule.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa14">The international community would like to see Burma develop into a stable, prosperous and democratic society. We would like to remove Burma from the list of nations about which we annually express concern.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg027-bk08-pa15">But as long as repression remains the Government's chosen means of conducting business with its own people, we will continue to meet our own responsibility to speak up and to assert the validity in Burma of the universal and cherished principles by which all nations have agreed to live, and without which no nation can fulfil its potential.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg028-bk01-pa03">Further, India firmly adheres to the Charter principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of United Nations Member States.

Such resolutions may also be in violation of Article 7 of the Charter of the United Nations. They open the way to selectivity and further politicization of the international human rights agenda, on which we articulated our position once again in the debate in the Third Committee during the ongoing session of the General Assembly. For the reasons I have mentioned, we have been obliged to vote against the resolution entitled "Situation of human rights in Kosovo" in the Third Committee and here in the plenary.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk01-pa01">My delegation wishes to explain its vote on the resolution entitled "Situation of human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk01-pa02">The delegation of the Republic of Croatia, acting in good faith, took part in deliberations with other interested delegations in the drafting of that resolution, in a sincere effort to reach a consensus text. While we had to make some difficult compromises, many of our concerns were taken into account by the sponsors, and because of that, my delegation thought it only proper and honourable to join in the consensus, despite having extremely strong reservations regarding a certain part of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk01-pa03">A vote was, however, called for, and we wish therefore to explain our vote. My delegation wishes to state that it objects to operative paragraph 13 of the resolution and in particular to the mentioning of the Zagreb city council. The paragraph refers to a situation that is being resolved within the Croatian constitutional and legal framework. Discussions are taking place among the parties concerned in order to resolve the issue in a democratic manner, and various proposals are being considered to break the impasse and select Zagreb's mayor.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk01-pa04">This is strictly an internal political matter. Such an issue should not be considered by the Third Committee of the General Assembly because it is not a human rights issue. It should be stressed that the elections for the Zagreb city council were free and fair. The results of the elections were respected; they were not annulled, and the democratically elected officials were allowed to take their seats. This was the case in all other elections in the Republic of Croatia, whether parliamentary or local.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk01-pa05">My delegation therefore objects to this matter being included in the resolution and dissociates itself from the portion of operative paragraph 13 dealing with this issue. However, for the reasons mentioned previously, and because we found the rest of the resolution acceptable, we supported the overall resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk01-pa06">My delegation also wishes to comment briefly on the issue of respect for the territorial integrity of States within their internationally recognized borders, a matter that was raised as an issue rather late in the process of adopting the draft of this resolution in Committee. As a State that was subjected to aggression and that had some 27 per cent of its territory occupied at one time, Croatia attaches great importance to the principle of respect for the territorial integrity of States.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk01-pa07">This is even more so since Croatia, to this day, does not exercise complete sovereignty over the entire length of its territory. The region of Eastern Slavonia is yet to be fully reintegrated into the Republic of Croatia. Concerning our general region, States can demonstrate their adherence to the principle of respect for the territorial integrity of States by, <i>inter alia</i>, undertaking measures within their capabilities that will ensure that all of the as yet non-reintegrated territory of the Republic of Croatia is reintegrated into Croatia as speedily as possible, without any undue delays.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk02-pa02">My delegation abstained in the voting on that resolution. Solomon Islands is committed to the advance and protection of human rights. We vote for resolutions written in that spirit, and we commend the balanced and objective reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk02-pa03">The resolution on the situation of human rights in Cuba, however, gives my delegation pause. While it commends the interim report of the Special Rapporteur in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-460.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/460</a> and cites the major elements of his critique of the situation of human rights in Cuba, it states nothing about his conclusions concerning the positive aspects of that changing situation in the face of the grave difficulties that that small island developing country endures because of the economic embargo imposed upon it.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk02-pa04">To advance and protect human rights, General Assembly resolutions must be balanced and impartial. In this context, Solomon Islands abstained.</p>

	<p id="docA51PV82-pg029-bk03-pa02">Respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity is a basic principle enshrined in the United Nations Charter.

In the view of the Chinese delegation, Kosovo is part of the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which, as a sovereign State, is entitled to respect for its territorial integrity and sovereignty.</p>

While we condemn in no uncertain terms the violations of human rights and repression and discrimination perpetrated against the Albanian ethnic population in Kosovo, the text totally ignores similar problems that exist in other areas of the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
