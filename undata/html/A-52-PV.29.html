	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">May I draw the attention of delegates to the fact that, on the recommendation of the General Committee, the General Assembly decided to consider agenda item 157 directly in plenary meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">In connection with this item, members will recall that the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform" has been issued as <a href="../pdf/A-51-950.pdf" class="pdf">document A/51/950</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa03">The Assembly also has before it two conference room papers prepared by the Secretariat: <a href="../pdf/A-52-CRP.1.pdf" class="nolink">A/52/CRP.1</a>, entitled "Establishment of the post of Deputy Secretary-General", and <a href="../pdf/A-52-CRP.2.pdf" class="nolink">A/52/CRP.2</a>, entitled "Rationalization of the subsidiary machinery of the Economic and Social Council".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa04">I should like to recall that an informal list of measures and proposals summarizing the principal actions and recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General, also prepared by the Secretariat, was made available yesterday and is being distributed today in this Conference Room. Therefore, we have three additional documents prepared by the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa05">During the past three weeks, I have carried out extensive consultations on the procedure to be followed to consider the reform proposals submitted by the Secretary-General. It is my understanding that the proposal to consider the item on United Nations reform at informal meetings reflects the preference of the members of the General Assembly. I therefore suggest that, under the chairmanship of the President, and with the assistance of the Vice-Presidents, open-ended informal consultations of the plenary should be held to facilitate the consideration of the reform proposals.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa06">In the absence of any objection, may I take it that the General Assembly agrees to continue its consideration of agenda item 157 in open-ended informal consultations of the plenary?</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">I see no objection. We shall therefore proceed accordingly.</p>
