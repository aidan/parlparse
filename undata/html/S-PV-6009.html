	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist suicide attacks that occurred in the towns of Hargeysa and Bosasso in Somalia on 29 October 2008. These heinous attacks, which caused numerous deaths and injuries and appear to have been coordinated, targeted the compound of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and an Ethiopian Government office, as well as local government offices.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims of these attacks and to their families, and to the people and authorities of Somalia and Ethiopia. It notes with appreciation that some of the victims are being treated at the French medical centre in Djibouti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council commends United Nations personnel for their action on the ground in Somalia, in support of the Somali population.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council underlines the need to bring the perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism to justice and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and consistent with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1624 (2005)</a>, to cooperate actively with the authorities of Somalia in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council further reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. The Council reminds States that they must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates its determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-41.pdf" class="nolink">S/PRST/2008/41</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
