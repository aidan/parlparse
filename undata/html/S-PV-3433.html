	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">&quot;The Security Council is deeply concerned at the deteriorating security situation in the safe area of Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has included increased levels of armed violence, deliberate attacks on UNPROFOR troops and on humanitarian flights, severe restrictions on public utilities, and continued restriction on the flow of transport and communications. It notes that normal life has not been fully restored to Sarajevo, as called for in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-900(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 900 (1994)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council expresses concern at the deliberate interruptions of utilities and communications to the civilian population in Sarajevo, as well as the extended period of closure of Sarajevo airport to humanitarian flights and the route across that airport opened in cooperation with UNPROFOR following the agreement of 17 March 1994, as a result of the actions by the Bosnian Serb party. The Council calls upon the Bosnian Serb Party not to interfere with the normal functioning of Sarajevo airport. It further calls upon the Bosnian Serb party to cooperate with efforts to fully restore the flow of gas and electricity to Sarajevo, to reopen all land routes to Sarajevo and, now and in the future, to refrain from impeding the normal operations of these and all other utilities, and means of communication and transport. It calls upon all parties not to interfere with the supply of gas or electricity to the civilian population. It reiterates its call to all parties, with the assistance of the United Nations, to achieve complete freedom of movement for the civilian population and for humanitarian goods to, from and within Sarajevo, to remove any hindrance to such freedom of movement, and to help restore normal life to the city.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;It condemns in particular the deliberate attack on 22 September 1994 on UNPROFOR troops in Sarajevo, just one of a number of attacks which clearly suggest a deliberate pattern. The Council also notes with alarm, and condemns without reservation, the reported statements of the Bosnian Serb leadership that the Bosnian Serb party would target UNPROFOR activities in retaliation for the passage of a Council resolution tightening sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs. It warns the Bosnian Serb leadership against any retaliatory action, whether against UNPROFOR or any other party, and, in that context, welcomes efforts to support UNPROFOR troops.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Council fully supports UNPROFOR's efforts to assure compliance with measures designed by the international community to improve conditions in Sarajevo. It advises both parties, and in particular the Bosnian Serbs, to comply with those measures.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Council strongly condemns any provocative actions in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina by whomsoever committed and demands immediate cessation of such actions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Council encourages the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and UNPROFOR to explore as a matter of priority proposals for the demilitarization of Sarajevo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;The Council affirms its determination to remain seized of the matter.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-57.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/57</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
