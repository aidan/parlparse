	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I have great pleasure in inviting the Secretary-General to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Let me begin by thanking you, Mr. President, and the members of the Security Council for your decision to convene today's meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">As the Council is well aware, peacekeeping today bears little resemblance to its original character. Many of today's peacekeeping operations seek not only to bring stability to areas of conflict, but also to address the root causes of conflict. This means tackling a wide variety of needs, ranging from the political to the social and the economic. In many conflict situations, the processes of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) are at the heart of these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">That said, let me emphasize at the outset that no efforts of ours can be a substitute for the political will of the parties to commit themselves to peace. Still, the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping operation has frequently made a crucial contribution, not least by helping create an environment where this process can proceed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">We are here today because we are united in our will to strengthen the United Nations ability to play an effective role in helping societies address the complex issues of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. I hope that today's discussion can lead to a renewed determination to provide those peacekeeping operations that are supporting these tasks with the mandates and resources they need. I will briefly address some of the larger issues concerning this process, but I urge the Council to review carefully my report, which covers the challenges in this area more broadly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">If peacekeeping operations are to support DDR processes efficiently, it is essential that the provisions for DDR be integrated into any peace agreement that is reached. My report before the Council suggests that, where feasible, arrangements for the disposal of arms and ammunition should be decided as part of peace negotiations, so that questions of how to dispose of the collected arms and ammunition do not subsequently become a stumbling block.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">In addition, it is clear that an operation aimed at addressing the issue of demobilization may require a considerable deterrent capacity, which should be provided early in its deployment.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">It is also often essential that arms issues be considered in a regional context. Prerequisites for a successful regional approach include bilateral decisions to share intelligence and information, cooperation by relevant regional organizations and continued support from the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">Responding to arms trafficking may also require a focus on financial flows, including information on where faction leaders are obtaining funds, where they are holding them and how they are spending them.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">While primary responsibility for reintegration falls outside peacekeeping, I believe that peacekeeping operations can nonetheless play a key role in this important element of post-conflict reconstruction. In particular, peacekeeping operations can help ensure that all factions view the political process as one in which they can reasonably hope to compete, and that it provides a fair and legitimate alternative to violence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">In order to succeed in confronting this key challenge, however, we need to extend the range of tools available to peacekeeping operations. We need, in particular, to continue and strengthen our special focus on the needs of child soldiers. That means following up our most recent discussions to include in two United Nations operations, in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a child protection adviser who can identify child-related concerns in the planning, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration phases.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">We also need to see a more flexible approach by the Security Council to the use of assessed funding for critical elements of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration so that the process can go ahead, even while funding through voluntary sources is being mobilized. These elements include the destruction of weapons, the provision of seed money for quick-impact projects and measures for child soldiers, including girl soldiers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">Finally, we need to improve our ability to locate experienced disarmament experts and trainers for service within peacekeeping operations in the field. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations has worked over the past year to develop training materials in this area for the use of Member States, and will continue these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">Today's peacekeeping operations engage a wide spectrum of partners within the United Nations system, including the World Bank, in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities. More and more, however, they also need to look beyond the United Nations system. Regional organizations and international and local non-governmental organizations can contribute to disarmament and demobilization, and, as we have seen recently in Kosovo, may assist in rebuilding the social and political infrastructure that permits reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">Allow me to conclude by urging the Council to view disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes as only one part of the multifaceted approach necessary if we are to succeed in peacekeeping in the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">We must also renew our efforts in the political sphere, where we can do more to channel differences peacefully through the rule of law; in the military and security sphere, where we can do more to help armed factions transform themselves into political civilian organizations; in the humanitarian sphere, where we can do more to alleviate the suffering of civilians as the first victims of war and the last beneficiaries of peace; and in the socio-economic sphere, where we can do more to link post-conflict reconstruction with assistance for lasting development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">Only within such a broad framework can the international community make a meaningful contribution to the success of this crucial element of post-conflict peace-building.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Shen Guofang</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">First of all, Mr. President, I would like to thank you and the rest of the delegation of Bangladesh for holding this meeting on this important issue and to express my appreciation to the Secretary-General for his statement. Our thanks go also to the delegation of Malaysia for its efforts in enhancing the Security Council's awareness of the issue of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants in a peacekeeping environment.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">In recent years, facts and experiences have shown that the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process has become an increasingly important component of United Nations peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building activities; in particular, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers has drawn wide attention. Current United Nations peacekeeping activities in Kosovo, East Timor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and other places have all to varying degrees involved the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants; this highlights the importance and relevance of our discussion in the Security Council today.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">We thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive and informative report on this issue and wish to take this opportunity to make some preliminary comments.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">First, the Security Council, which bears primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, should attach due importance to the matter of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and should provide policy guidance for work in this field. We endorse the view that disarmament, demobilization and reintegration should be included in relevant peace agreements from the very beginning, with overall planning that takes into account the specifics of each conflict, clearly defines the responsibilities of the parties concerned and of the United Nations, and identifies the sources of the financial resources needed. In this regard, because this process involves political, economic, military, social and other factors, the United Nations should carefully listen to and fully respect the opinions of all parties involved, especially those of the Governments concerned, and should seek their support and cooperation, so as to create a basis for the smooth implementation of the programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">Secondly, without a relatively secure and stable environment, it is impossible for the United Nations to carry out disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes in coordination with the countries and parties concerned. Without guaranteed safety, ex-combatants will not voluntarily give up their weapons, and a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process will therefore be out of the question. Therefore, the parties to a conflict should demonstrate political will for this process and should abide by agreed ceasefires in earnest. At the same time, United Nations peacekeeping operations should be put in place as soon as possible, to help stabilize the situation on the ground. The current peacekeeping operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is at such a critical stage, and needs a concerted effort by all parties to the conflict and by the United Nations. Otherwise, there will be no prospect of a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, and the peace agreement cannot possibly be fully implemented.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">Thirdly, when carrying out disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, the international community, including the United Nations, must maintain an impartial and objective attitude and must enable all former combatants to be fully and thoroughly transformed into civilians or to be incorporated into regular national forces in accordance with the relevant peace agreements. The existence of illegal armed forces in any form cannot be allowed, lest there be a resurgence of destabilizing factors. To take the case of Kosovo, the Kosovo Force (KFOR) has been in place for several months, but the situation remains turbulent and volatile, with continued and constant violence. Therefore, the Security Council should follow closely the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process in Kosovo and should sum up past experience and lessons learned. That would enhance our in-depth understanding of what is being discussed here today.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">Fourthly, illicit arms flows have more often than not made effective disarmament, demobilization and reintegration operations very difficult to carry out or have obliterated their achievements. The parties concerned should therefore control such flows. And more important, the Security Council's existing mechanisms for arms embargoes should be strictly implemented. The series of guidelines on the collection and disposal of arms and the demobilization and rehabilitation of ex-combatants adopted by the United Nations Disarmament Commission in April 1999 should be abided by and implemented, and should be considered as a basis for future studies on this question by relevant United Nations bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">Fifthly, the issue of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration is very complicated, involving different fields and sectors. We endorse the proposal made by the Secretary-General in his report that coordination and cooperation among relevant agencies should be strengthened. The issue of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration is not only something for the Security Council to discuss from the perspective of maintaining security and peace; it also demands participation and coordinated action by all relevant United Nations bodies and the exchange of information and communication among them. In this regard, guaranteed sufficient resources are critical. We call on the international community and relevant United Nations agencies to provide the necessary contributions and appropriations for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in a peacekeeping environment. We believe that serious consideration should be accorded the proposal in the report of the Secretary-General that the coordination of voluntary and assessed funding should be enhanced in providing financial support.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">In his report, the Secretary-General puts forward many concrete proposals that require full study by the Security Council and other relevant bodies. We hope that today's discussions will be able to benefit the Security Council and other relevant agencies in their review of past experiences and lessons and in improving the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes in current United Nations peacekeeping or post-conflict peace-building operations and those to be authorized in the future. The Chinese delegation supports the draft presidential statement to be adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">As observed in the presidential statement, the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, which involves economic, social and other aspects, must be addressed comprehensively. Here, I would like to reiterate that the international community should step up its long-term assistance for development to countries concerned, and to African countries in particular, in order to help develop their economies and root out the underlying causes of conflicts. Only by so doing can the achievements of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration be consolidated.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gatilov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">The Russian delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General for the comprehensive report on United Nations peacekeeping operations in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of former parties to armed conflicts. We are also grateful to him for the statement he made in the Council today.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">We agree with the main conclusion of the report that this process is of vital importance for the long-term settlement of conflicts, and also with the idea that the key to the success of a peaceful settlement is the political will of the parties to the conflict. In view of this, Russia supports the further enhancement of the United Nations role in carrying out tasks relating to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The Russian Federation believes that the attainment of these goals requires a comprehensive approach to the coordination of actions by United Nations bodies. We believe that during the period of post-conflict peace-building a leading role should be played by the Economic and Social Council, the specialized agencies and the United Nations programmes. However, since disarmament, demobilization and reintegration is a cross-cutting issue, and since it is a job that can be carried out at both the peacekeeping and peace-building stages, we deem it justified, in cases where the situation warrants, for the Security Council to establish follow-on missions whose mandates could include DDR tasks. It is very important here to be extremely precise about defining these tasks in the mandates of the operations and to determine the functions of the organs participating in the solution.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Experience has shown that the effectiveness of the United Nations efforts in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration depends directly on the extent to which they command the support of the parties directly involved in the conflict. Attempts to use force to resolve problems -- as was the case with Somalia, for example -- usually do not work. In this connection, we agree with the Secretary-General's view that the best way to ensure a legal basis for the DDR process is to include appropriate provisions in the ceasefire agreements; and when these agreements are under negotiation, it would be desirable to bring in international experts at the early stages of the talks.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Clearly, an important factor for the success of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration -- and in everything that is related to peacekeeping -- is learning from past experience, including negative experience. Methods for carrying out disarmament, demobilization and reintegration that have proved to work in practice, including those aspects of processes that relate to specific problems arising from the involvement of women and children in armed conflicts, should be a subject of study during the training of national peacekeeping personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">However, good decisions very often remain mere words on paper and are not properly implemented. A graphic illustration of this was the collapse of the peace process in Angola, where the disarmament of UNITA -- and this was the fault of that organization's leadership -- was basically a fiction. There are also serious questions as to how the demilitarization of the Kosovo Liberation Army took place in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Carrying out the tasks under discussion today means, as a rule, that major and often costly projects must be initiated, and a comprehensive approach and the coordinated efforts of the international community are required. We welcome the increasingly active involvement of the World Bank in providing technical and financial support for DDR processes. Enhancing the effectiveness of United Nations efforts in this area would be helped by expanding dialogue with international monetary institutions that, because of their experience and resources, could make a key contribution to carrying out DDR programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">The job of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration is intrinsically linked to the problem of the rampant spread of small arms and light weapons, primarily in crisis areas. Russia is interested in intensifying the struggle against the illegal spread of conventional weapons, particularly in conflict areas. Enhancing the effectiveness of Security Council arms embargoes is on the agenda now. As the experience of Angola and a number of other conflicts has shown, a porous embargo can only increase military confrontation between the parties to the conflict and subvert the Security Council's authority and that of the United Nations as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that Russia fully recognizes its responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council and will continue to make an active and practical contribution to United Nations peacekeeping activities in all of their aspects, including the questions that are under discussion today in the Security Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Soderberg</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I applaud you, Mr. President, for holding this meeting today, and we are particularly pleased by the presence of the Secretary-General. The key role of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) is one that is far too often overlooked. Yet it is an essential element to many post-conflict peace-building efforts. Today's meeting will help ensure that we all stay engaged in the effort to build peace -- not just stop war.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Today's meeting builds on our open debate last July under the presidency of Malaysia. We thank Ambassador Hasmy and the delegation of Malaysia once again for their continuing effort to focus the Council's attention on these issues. Today's meeting will help the Council remain engaged on this important matter, and I hope that we take up the Secretary-General's call this morning to address the issue with renewed determination.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">When peace agreements are successfully reached, it is essential that steps be taken to promote the transition of war-torn societies from conflict to normalcy. Key to this transition is the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of the ex-combatants into the fabric of civil society. The Secretary-General's report of 11 February underscores this point.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">As the Secretary-General recommends in that report, the ability of future peacekeeping operations to advance disarmament, demobilization and reintegration goals can be enhanced in several ways. These include explicit reference to DDR programmes in peace agreements; ensuring adequate technical and financial support for such activities in all operations; and improving institutional coordination among the bodies of the international community that address these needs.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">It is essential that the Council underscore the point that successful DDR activities depend upon the political will of the parties involved to commit themselves to peace. The success of such activities requires the cooperation of entire populations, former combatants and civilians.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">The international community can support this process, but it cannot provide the will required to bring it to a successful conclusion. This point is being made very clearly in Sierra Leone, where the commitment to the peace agreement of the Revolutionary United Front, and especially of its leader Foday Sankoh, remains in doubt. One key indicator of the problem is the low number and quality of weapons that have been turned in thus far under the DDR programme currently under way in Sierra Leone. Moreover, far too few combatants have presented themselves for disarmament and demobilization. Similarly, the disturbing outbreak of violence in the Congo discussed yesterday by this Council gives weight to the point that the international community cannot fulfil its obligations if the parties fail to meet their own commitments.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">With regard to disarmament, surplus small arms and light weapons in post-conflict situations all too often fuel renewed fighting and banditry. Effective disposal -- and preferably destruction -- of small arms, light weapons and ammunition must be part of any peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">In addition, the Council must be prepared to consider measures to limit the flow of small arms and other weapons into DDR zones, including sanctions, if necessary and appropriate. As Ambassador Fowler has so ably demonstrated, more effective enforcement of existing sanctions can also play a role, including in the prevention of new arms flows into a region. The United States looks forward to participating in next year's United Nations conference here in New York on illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">The goal of demobilization activities is to remove ex-combatants from military organizations and structures as quickly as possible -- to free these populations to return to lives as productive citizens and to contribute to the development of their societies. To advance demobilization, sufficient resources and political support must be provided to peacekeeping operations. As the Secretary-General correctly notes, a mission that has been perceived as strong from its beginning is far less likely to be tested than one that is perceived as vulnerable or ineffective.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">We see much reintegration work as distinct from traditional peacekeeping activities of disarmament and demobilization. Disarmament and demobilization are under the purview of the Security Council and often part of peacekeeping operations, although implementation of these activities has at times been shared by humanitarian agencies. Reintegration, however, must be viewed as a post-conflict peace-building or development activity. The Secretary-General's report notes the complexity of reintegration activities and the number of organizations and actors that can contribute to their success. We welcome improved coordination among implementing agencies -- including World Bank support for reintegration in Sierra Leone -- and note the need for further progress. We also concur with the Secretary-General that involving commercial interests in peace efforts can support the processes and encourage further exploration in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa11">We agree with the Secretary-General that there can be problems in identifying adequate funding for DDR activities and, with the implosion of societies that is occurring in today's conflicts, it is critical that we strike the right balance between assessed and voluntary contributions to address these issues.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa12">The Secretary-General's report highlights the special needs of child soldiers during all phases of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, including the special needs of girl soldiers due to their roles as fighters, messengers, spies, labourers and sexual slaves. We applaud the efforts of the United Nations Children's Fund and others to meet these critical needs in existing operations and their plans to do so in future DDR programmes. I am happy to note also the consensus agreement reached in January on the addition of an optional protocol on involvement of children in armed conflict to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. By addressing forced recruitment and the conduct of armed rebels, this agreement strikes at the heart of the problem of child soldiers.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa13">In discussing disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, we often overlook the special needs of women ex-combatants. As correctly underlined in the Secretary-General's report, female ex-combatants and their children are especially vulnerable in post-conflict situations. DDR plans should seek to assist women and girls who have suffered sexual abuse, have been forced to participate in violence or have had to bear children for their victimizers, and who may risk rejection by their communities. Sustainable reintegration of former combatants is a prerequisite to the prevention of future conflicts, and women are often excluded from this process. In a broader context, we rarely consider the powerful role women can play in reintegration, peace-building and conflict resolution. Women's involvement as leaders, mediators and teachers can have a critical impact on the success of reintegration efforts and their involvement is essential for maintaining peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa14">In conclusion, the Council's task of maintaining international peace and security requires that we pay close attention to the important issues we discuss here today. As the United Nations develops methods and means to address post-conflict peace-building requirements, our ability to undertake successful and complete DDR programmes will grow. I commend you, Mr. President, and our other colleagues who have taken the lead on this issue. The United States looks forward to working together to put into practice the ideas and plans we discuss here today.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cappagli</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Allow me first of all to express my thanks to your delegation, Mr. President, for the initiative of convening this debate. In particular, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his substantive participation and for his very comprehensive report on the role of United Nations peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Eight months ago, we expressed our profound concern that, in a number of conflicts, the various parties or factions continued to engage in armed struggle, despite the fact that peace agreements had been concluded by the warring parties and despite the presence in the field of United Nations peacekeeping operations. We continue to be troubled by this situation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Likewise, on that occasion we acknowledged that the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants should be seen not as isolated elements, but as a continuous process involving wide-ranging efforts to secure peace, stability and development.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">There can be no doubt that the basis for the DDR process is the political resolve of the parties concerned, which requires the assistance of the international community. This political will must be embodied in a peace agreement that meticulously outlines the process. Such an agreement would provide operations with a clear mandate and facilitate contributions by the international community of the necessary experts and resources.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">We should not lose sight of the fact that the disarmament activities of peacekeeping operations can profit from the measures undertaken by Member States to combat illicit trafficking in arms. For its part, demobilization is emerging as the decisive factor in ensuring the continuity of the process. Hence, the importance of ensuring that this phase be completed as quickly as possible and give way to the reintegration phase with a view to establishing the right political and social environment.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">I need hardly emphasize that the needs of children in conflict zones must be addressed and that their rights should be an explicit priority in the processes aimed at establishing and fostering peace and resolving conflicts. And finally, there is no doubt that proper coordination of efforts among the various actors involved and an ample supply of personnel and resources -- particularly financial resources -- are indispensable if the processes of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants are to be successful.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">It is especially appropriate to address the issue of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants in the context of peacekeeping, because these activities represent the first step -- indeed, perhaps the key step -- towards preventing a recurrence of conflict, securing lasting peace and creating conditions conducive to sustainable development. The challenge is immense, but the task is so important and the human and financial costs of conflict are so great that we must do all in our power to help peoples escape from recurrent cycles of violence.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">We are moving in the right direction. Let us spare no effort. Let us move forward with determination. Success is within our reach.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Ashipala-Musavyi</span> <span class="nation">Namibia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">We join others in expressing our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report. We also welcome the introductory remarks that he made this morning, which, in our view, provide food for further thought. In our view, the Secretary-General's report on the role of United Nations peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) is very timely. It comes at a very crucial time, when we are confronted with complex conflict situations whose successful resolution may well depend on how disarmament, demobilization and reintegration are handled.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">The report of the Secretary-General is comprehensive and practical and we are of the view that it only remains for all of us to study the recommendations contained therein, as well as to take into account the additional views which have been and will be made by our colleagues this morning, so as to see how we can work them into United Nations peacekeeping operations. For this reason, my remarks will be very brief.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Let me also mention that an unsuccessful DDR programme results in the recurrence of conflict, bringing with it a complete breakdown of governing institutions, the destruction of physical infrastructure, further displacement of populations and subsequent massive human suffering. Hence, in our view, DDR is an important and indispensable part of peacekeeping and peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The phenomenon of grinding, widespread poverty in the midst of plenty should touch the conscience and the political will of the international community. The conflict-stricken countries, particularly those in Africa, cannot emerge from their protracted civil conflicts without generous assistance from the international community to enable them to lay the foundations for durable peace and recovery and to avoid a relapse into conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">It is also important to promote reconciliation, engage civil society and ensure the total commitment of parties to a peaceful resolution of conflict. Indeed, as has been mentioned by colleagues who spoke before me, the international community can only assist; the parties must be willing to disarm and committed to doing so. However, in situations where the causes of a conflict have an external dimension, it is important that pressure be brought to bear by all involved, directly or indirectly, for the parties to disarm. More importantly, in our view, faction leaders should be held accountable for the disarmament and demobilization of their combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">Although every situation has its unique attributes, DDR is a process whose parts cannot be treated in isolation. All components have to be addressed, for they complement one another. In approving peacekeeping operations, therefore, clear mandates have to be given, with a clear division of responsibilities among the various United Nations organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">The rehabilitation and detraumatization of the victims of conflict, especially child soldiers, have been extensively elaborated in the Secretary-General's report, and rightly so. The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers should be given priority attention. The situation of the girl child in particular has to be taken into account. We also think that it would help enormously if the situation of children and child soldiers were taken seriously, addressed from the very beginning and included in the negotiation of peace agreements. In this regard, we greatly welcome the inclusion of a child protection adviser in United Nations operations in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Women, too, should be involved in DDR programmes, for they are affected in a special way by conflict and are often left to fend for themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">In this context, we believe that the recommendations contained in the Beijing Platform for Action on women in armed conflict can serve to provide valuable input. Similarly, in our view, the Division for the Advancement of Women has an important role to play here.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Demining operations, the reconstitution of State structures and the restoration of industrial and agricultural production are necessary for the realization of the DDR process, especially during the reintegration process. In our view, this is where international assistance is crucial.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">Finally, we must, indeed, draw on lessons learned from other United Nations operations, be they positive or negative. In conclusion, I should like to say that we support the draft presidential statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hasmy</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I should like to express my appreciation to you, Mr. President, for convening this open meeting of the Council on this important subject. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for the very important statement which he has just made and for his report on the role of the United Nations in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants in a peacekeeping environment. Both the Secretary-General's statement and his comprehensive and most informative report on the subject have provided us with an extremely useful basis for in-depth consideration of this subject.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">It is, indeed, encouraging to note that considerable progress has been made since we last debated this issue in July last year, during Malaysia's presidency of the Council. I believe that the report relating to principles and guidelines on DDR, prepared by the Lessons Learned Unit last year, is now ready to be issued to all Member States. We believe that the report, when released, will contribute enormously to the more effective implementation of DDR on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Since the late 1980s, we have learned that peacekeeping operations cannot be mounted in isolation. Experience tells us that DDR has to be a part of the overall effort in making a peace process a success. It provides a link from cessation of hostilities to sustainable peace by incorporating political, security, economic and social objectives into the process. DDR is a long-term programme which continues until all ex-combatants are fully reintegrated into the mainstream of society at all levels. It is a holistic process, involving many actors and requiring the full cooperation of society. It is therefore important that all parties to the conflict be made fully aware of the process involved and have the political will to undertake it.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">As rightly pointed out in the Secretary-General's report, DDR must be viewed not as a simple sequence of events, but rather as a continuous process whose elements overlap with one another and are mutually supportive. The success of the process is dependent on the success of each of its steps. Clearly, the DDR process must begin with the first step -- namely, disarmament -- which, of course, can be achieved only on the basis of a ceasefire in the context of a peace agreement. The effective disarmament of ex-combatants represents an important indicator of progress towards post-conflict peace-building and the normalization of a conflict situation. Demobilization, which follows, is possible only when there is some level of disarmament, and its success can be achieved only when there is effective rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants into society. Reintegration of ex-combatants -- the third stage -- can be effectively carried out only in the context of a comprehensive political settlement, in which national reconciliation will obviously have to play a major part.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">These are important steps, but we also agree with the view that to ensure the final success of the process, elements of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration should also be integrated not only in peacekeeping mandates but also in peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">In a number of conflicts, armed fighting among various factions continues despite the conclusion of peace agreements and the presence of United Nations peacekeeping missions on the ground. A major factor contributing to such a situation has been the continued availability of large amounts of armaments, in particular small arms and light weapons. The proliferation of these weapons in a climate of continuing insecurity in a post-conflict situation is clearly not conducive to the speedy return of peace and certainly dampens efforts at promoting social and economic development. In this regard, if disarmament is to be undertaken effectively, it may be necessary to impose a regional mechanism to strictly monitor an arms embargo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">Equally important in this exercise is the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers. While Governments could be held accountable for the use of children as soldiers, it is often difficult to induce change in rebel groups and to have them admit to the use of children. It is shocking to learn that as many as 300,000 children under the age of 18 are currently participating in armed conflicts around the world. Even more alarming is the fact that this trend of involving children in armed conflict is on the increase. Until and unless this issue is seriously addressed, children may not only be exposed to grave physical risks when they participate in armed conflict but also suffer severe long-term psychological consequences. In this context, I should like to pay special tribute to the important work and enormous contribution of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">It is imperative that the special case of child soldiers be included in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes and that their special needs be addressed. In this regard, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations with expertise in the field can make important contributions in the effective implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration as they relate to children. We also feel that the role of women, as highlighted by the two women speakers before me, in respect of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration should also be recognized and appropriately reflected in future reports.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">The education and training of peacekeepers on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration are important elements for the successful implementation of these activities in mission areas. In this regard, I would like to commend the United Nations Secretariat, in particular the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, for successfully coordinating the excellent work that has been carried out by some Member States and organizations towards the drafting of a training programme and action plan on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. We hope that the training activities will have the support of as many Member States as possible, including international organizations and non-governmental organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">As in all United Nations programmes and activities, financing continues to be a problem in the effective implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes. While little or no support can be expected at the local level, for obvious reasons, the generous support of the international community is critical for the effective implementation of DDR programmes. There is clearly a need for greater coordination in the area of funding, both assessed and voluntary, for more effective implementation of these programmes. We therefore urge the various United Nations organs and bodies to work out arrangements that would satisfy the requirements of specific disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes in different post-conflict situations in the context of the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the countries concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa11">It is clear that disarmament, demobilization and reintegration has become an important, indeed, indispensable component of all contemporary peacekeeping operations which I believe should be addressed by the Council on an ongoing basis. The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process is certainly not an end in itself but must be seen as an objective that will help restore normalcy and make a contribution to lasting peace. My delegation believes that all ex-combatants should be reintegrated, except persons responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Because it may not always be possible to prosecute the perpetrators immediately after the conflict, statutory limitations should not apply in cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Bringing the perpetrators to justice remains an essential element of national reconciliation, which provides an indispensable basis for a durable peace.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa12">Given the importance of the subject in the context of contemporary peacekeeping operations, my delegation urges the Council to continue to address this issue on a regular basis and in this regard looks forward to a further report from the Secretary-General in the future, particularly as regards the implementation of DDR training programmes. It is hoped that the report will also address the important issue of financing in greater depth, as it remains a critical element for the success of the programme.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, my delegation fully supports the draft statement that we will be adopting at the end of this meeting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Harrison</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The United Kingdom welcomes the Secretary-General's report. It provides a useful general overview of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) issues in the peacekeeping context, and it puts forward some interesting proposals. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for his very useful introduction to today's debate.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">I will not make a detailed statement on this subject today. The Permanent Representative of Portugal will be making a statement on behalf of the European Union later in this debate which comprehensively reflects the United Kingdom's views on this subject.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">I would, however, like to highlight two key issues from the United Kingdom's recent experience of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in Sierra Leone. The first is the importance of adequate resources. As the Secretary-General observes, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes need to be placed on a firmer financial footing. The World Bank has struggled to persuade donors to contribute to its Trust Fund for Sierra Leone. Unless further substantial contributions are received, key initial disarmament and demobilization activities in Sierra Leone will not be carried out. This will jeopardize not only the success of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), but also the peace process as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">We agree with the Secretary-General that further thought must be given to ensuring reliable funding for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes. We would suggest that the Secretary-General might explore a range of possible financing options with interested Member States, the World Bank and others, and make further recommendations on this subject.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">The second point I wish to highlight is the need for proper coordination of all players involved in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes. They invariably involve a number of actors from different organizations. In Sierra Leone, the lack of effective coordination between key players has resulted in confusion, delays and misunderstandings. We would therefore encourage the United Nations to provide a coordinating framework wherever this is possible.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ben Mustapha</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, I should like to thank you for having convened this important meeting of the Security Council devoted to the role of the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants in the context of peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building activities, and in particular to the quest for ways and means of ensuring that the process helps to enhance the effectiveness of the activities involved in peacekeeping and peace-building. I also thank the Secretary-General for the important introductory statement he made this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The renewed consideration of this matter by the Security Council in the context of its prerogatives in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security attests to the concern that this body rightly feels for this threefold process, which is now a key dimension of peacekeeping -- namely, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of those who until recently were fighting on opposite sides in an armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">As the Secretary-General rightly points out in his exhaustive and detailed report to the Security Council on this issue, this tripartite process contributes decidedly to consolidating the foundations of peace and stability because it helps reinforce confidence among former belligerents, stabilizes situations after conflicts and facilitates the transition of a society from conflict to normalcy and development.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">The international community has already acquired considerable experience in this area in the context of United Nations peacekeeping operations, and in particular in the course of the last decade. That experience offers us abundant lessons that we can apply to future activities. At the present stage, we need to refine, consolidate and build on that experience. In this connection, it seems to us that the following aspects are of particular importance.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">First, the systematic inclusion of clauses regarding the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants in any peace agreement bringing a conflict to an end would be productive in helping ensure that the agreement contained a number of parameters for the process, which must be carried out with the political commitment of the parties.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Secondly, it seems to us that having the United Nations coordinate all disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities should be the focus of sustained attention, given the interlinkage, interdependence and complementarity relating to the disarmament process in the overall peacekeeping and peace-building environment.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">Thirdly, we consider that substantial and sustained support from the international community is a necessity, in particular with regard to the requisite skills and financial resources. There is definitely a role to be played here by donors and international financial institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">Finally, the international community should pay constant attention to the question of child soldiers, whose recruitment has become a systematic and sadly disquieting phenomenon in a number of armed conflicts, in defiance of universal norms and to the detriment to these children's dignity, mental stability and psychological well-being.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">The draft statement that the President will be reading out shortly on behalf of the Council seems to us to reflect all of these concerns. It is for this reason that we support it unreservedly.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hamer</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I thank you, Mr. President, for organizing today's important meeting on the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) process. I would also like to thank the delegation of Malaysia, which first took the initiative to place this subject on our agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">My delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General for introducing his comprehensive and thoughtful report. We welcome in particular the attention devoted in his report and in his introductory statement to the problem of child soldiers, including girl soldiers.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">The representative of Portugal will make an exhaustive statement on today's very important agenda item on behalf of the European Union and 15 other like-minded European countries. I fully associate myself with that statement, and I will therefore limit myself to some brief remarks on confidence-building and commitment in the framework of DDR programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">First, on the subject of confidence-building, peacekeeping operations are themselves a major source of confidence-building. The long-term purpose of DDR programmes is to enhance political stability, peace and security. For DDR programmes to succeed, however, there needs to be at least a degree of political stability and security to begin with -- that is, in the disarmament phase. It is in that phase that peacekeeping operations in themselves contribute to confidence-building.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Secondly, for the purpose of confidence-building it is vital that all parties, including armed civilians, should be targeted by the disarmament efforts, and that all arms collected should be destroyed. If the disarmament effort is limited and fails to target all, the results may well be an illicit arms trade, violence and crime. Obviously, this would undermine confidence in the process. Neighbouring countries may have to be involved in disarmament processes as well, as that can help curb cross-border arms trading and crime.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">Next, on the subject of commitment, the all-important condition for DDR programmes to be successful evidently is the full political commitment of all warring parties to the peace process. There are three aspects of commitment that I would like to highlight. First, ex-combatants should be committed to the planning and management of DDR programmes, especially programmes for re-integration and training. There is evidence that the actual involvement of ex-combatants in such programmes has a positive impact, both in terms of cost control and in the reduction of political tension.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Secondly, the commitment of civil society to DDR programmes creates a sense of ownership in the implementation of disarmament and reintegration. Full information on the programme and its purposes will clearly contribute to this sense of commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">Thirdly, the international community needs to be committed to the implementation of DDR programmes, usually including generous financial support. Providing for the effective coordination of the programmes is another important way the international community can contribute. My delegation welcomes the emphasis placed on this aspect of coordination by the Secretary-General in his report.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">Finally, in the presidential statement on small arms of 24 September 1999 the Council requested the Secretary-General to develop a reference manual, for use in the field, on ecologically safe methods of weapons destruction. The Council also invited Member States to facilitate the preparation of such a manual. The Netherlands attaches great importance to post-conflict ecologically sound weapons destruction. In this context, I am pleased to inform the Council that the Netherlands has decided to make a substantial contribution towards the preparation of such a field manual on weapons destruction.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ward</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">My delegation wishes to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this debate to discuss the issue of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR), which constitute key elements in the transition to sustainable peace and development in post-conflict societies.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">We are also grateful to the Secretary-General for his report and for his statement to the Council today. He has underscored the need to strengthen the role of peacekeeping operations in helping create the appropriate environment for successful disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">My delegation believes that today's discussion offers an important opportunity for the Council to reassess the outcome of DDR efforts that have been incorporated into relevant peacekeeping arrangements, with a view to ensuring that lessons learned in the past are not overlooked in future operations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">We wish to recall that with conducive conditions, DDR programmes can effectively achieve their objectives for effective post-conflict peace-building. In this regard, the United Nations can be proud of its successes in El Salvador, Guatemala, Mozambique and, more recently, the Central African Republic. These cases clearly demonstrate the capacity of the United Nations to achieve effective reintegration of ex-combatants when appropriate steps are taken to include clear and well-defined DDR programmes in peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">In an effort to expand this record of successes, it is clear that a number of crucial elements must be taken into account. First, DDR must be seen as an integrated process, with each activity being given sufficient attention by the international community. There is ample evidence to suggest, as highlighted in the Secretary-General's report, that DDR must be addressed comprehensively and that adequate political, financial and material support for each phase of the process is essential in ensuring a peaceful transition.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">Secondly, in addition to the swift provision of ample resources, the strong political will of the parties involved and of the international community to the DDR process are indispensable. The critical and complex task of rehabilitation and reconstruction must be approached from this perspective and be viewed as an inclusive process, involving the full cooperation of the civilian population, non-governmental organizations, regional bodies, international financial institutions and, particularly, private businesses.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">Thirdly, among the most important criteria for the success of any DDR process is the need to ensure that peacekeeping operations continue to be clearly defined and that the impartiality, legitimacy, political momentum and resources they provide to the DDR process be fully sustained. A clear definition of DDR tasks must be included with peace agreements with the consent of the parties, with such tasks being carefully defined at the outset of peace negotiations to ensure a secure and safe environment for ex-combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">Fourthly, the Council must monitor closely current DDR programmes. Only last week, the Council was apprised of the slow development of DDR in Sierra Leone and the low quantity of weapons being surrendered by armed groups. The Security Council must continue to send a strong message to armed groups that their cooperation in these endeavours is critical to the restoration of sustainable peace and long-term economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">There are several issues identified in the Secretary-General's report which deserve special mention.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Adequate and timely funding of the DDR process is critical to ensuring its success. The practice of financing demobilization and reintegration exercises from voluntary funding continues to present a serious resource problem and my delegation is inclined to support the provision of funding, within the assessed budget of a peacekeeping operation, to facilitate the process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Addressing the special needs of child soldiers, including girl soldiers, has important long-term implications for social and economic rehabilitation. Providing appropriate services for the security, health, education and psychological treatment of disarmed child soldiers, as well as refugees and other displaced persons, should constitute a major element of any reintegration process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">My delegation concurs with the Secretary-General's recommendation that child protection officers should be included in the staffing and mandates of United Nations peacekeeping operations and we are pleased at the efforts to include within all operations personnel with appropriate training in international humanitarian and human rights law, including child and gender-related provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa13">The linkage between DDR and the flow of arms into conflict areas continues to be an area of concern. As recent experiences clearly show, DDR cannot be effective if arms continue to flow into conflict areas. We support the need for an enhanced role of the Security Council in curbing the illicit flow of arms, including small arms, through the imposition of arms embargoes, where appropriate, and coordination with regional bodies and other relevant actors in addressing the illicit flow of arms and their collection and destruction. The international community must ensure that priority attention is given to addressing the economic dimensions of arms flows and that appropriate measures are taken in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa14">Support for long-term economic reconstruction and rehabilitation must also be given full attention. This is a critical element in fostering an appropriate environment for the full reintegration of ex-combatants. Commitment to the goals of peace and security is meaningless without a plan to foster economic growth and sustainable development. The search for peace and development requires efforts well beyond the withdrawal of peacekeeping missions, and strengthening the capacities of societies emerging from conflicts must be placed at the centre of sustainable peace. We therefore support the notion of the deployment of follow-on missions to help support advances made in securing durable peace and development.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa15">My delegation supports the adoption of the presidential statement, which focuses the attention of the international community on the importance of the DDR process in consolidating peace and security in countries emerging from conflict.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ouane</span> <span class="nation">Mali</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">Today, the Security Council is discussing the important issue of maintaining peace and security and post-conflict peace-building. The Secretary-General has laid a firm foundation for this debate by submitting a comprehensive report, entitled "The role of United Nations peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration", for which we thank him. In this regard, I would like to make a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">First, establishing a climate of trust among the various sectors of society in a country emerging from armed conflict is the fundamental prerequisite for achieving lasting peace. In this connection, the definition of an overall framework of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR), accompanied by a timetable and technical and financial means for its implementation, is essential. The central role of the United Nations in all phases of the process also constitutes an element of guarantee and a token of impartiality and legitimacy.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">However, as the Secretary-General points out, in order to be effective, United Nations intervention must be part of the framework of an agreement or a commitment between the various parties. In this respect, the Secretary-General's proposal to make disarmament, demobilization and reintegration a component of the mandates of peacekeeping operations deserves the full support of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">We also believe that, if United Nations activity is to yield tangible results, demilitarization expertise and adequate financial resources need to be mobilized at all stages of the process. In the same context, we should stress the importance of the role of the United Nations Special Representative in terms of the coordination of all DDR activities in cooperation with the various parties, United Nations institutions and the bilateral and multilateral cooperation agencies. Similarly, it seems to us that experience acquired in former or current peacekeeping operations should serve as a catalyst for future United Nations activity.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Secondly, the cooperation of regional organizations is necessary in the struggle against the flow of and trade in arms. Regional initiatives on the proliferation of light weapons in particular, such as the moratorium declared by the West African States, undoubtedly help create more effective conditions for controlling such weapons. Given their reach and scope, these initiatives should be supported technically and financially.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">Thirdly, the reintegration of ex-combatants into civil society is often a difficult undertaking that deserves special attention. The consolidation of the reintegration process requires taking into account the basic economic needs of ex-combatants, such as education, vocational training and the financing of their resettlement.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">In Mali, this type of preventive diplomacy has been very successful, following the settlement of the conflict that beset the northern part of the country in the early 1990s. Indeed, peace-building and economic and social development efforts have involved the progressive integration of numbers of ex-combatants into the armed and security forces of Mali and the State public services, as well as individual or group financing of small development projects in the northern part of the country. The effort to build peace and to revive economic and social activity in post-conflict situations are therefore just as important as those to prevent or settle conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">Fourthly, the phenomenon of child soldiers needs special attention. We bear a heavy responsibility with respect to this unfortunate phenomenon, which is unacceptable and which must be ended. In that connection, let me pay high tribute to the dynamic, intelligent and determined efforts of Mr. Olara Otunnu; we support him entirely. In our view, we need international programmes to provide long-term support and assistance for child soldiers and to strengthen the capacity of communities to offer such crucial long-term services.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">There are a number of lessons to be learned with respect to the matter under discussion. First, it prompts us to tackle tough issues such as land management, decentralization, education, communication and the strengthening of civil society through the establishment and strengthening of States based on the rule of law. Secondly, even modest measures, when taken in good time, can have a significant positive impact and can offer the hope of averting crisis. Thirdly, through good coordination, the international community may be able to prevent the outbreak of war and create conditions conducive to economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">The transition from a society in conflict to economic and social development is a major challenge demanding great international solidarity. The international community should therefore support the process of consolidating peace, reconstruction and development, so that disarmament, demobilization and reintegration can meet with success.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Levitte</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">Allow me first to thank you, Mr. President, for your initiative in organizing the resumption of a debate on this item that the Security Council began in July 1999 on the initiative of Malaysia. Today we can learn from the new light shed on this subject by the recent report of the Secretary-General. My delegation thanks the Secretary-General and congratulates him on his excellent report, which provides a good overview of the demands now being placed on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes in a peacekeeping context.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The representative of Portugal will soon make a statement on behalf of the European Union; clearly, France associates itself fully with that statement. I wish only to make a few brief comments at this stage.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Everyone agrees that the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants is an indispensable part of the settlement of conflicts. But that task can succeed in the long term -- and I stress "in the long term" -- only if a number of conditions are met. First of all, disarmament and demobilization must come about through agreement among all belligerent parties. To impose it by force inevitably means a return to war. For if those bearing arms are given no guarantees, can they be expected to let themselves be disarmed without resistance? Therefore, agreements between belligerent parties -- before peacekeeping operations are set up -- must include specific provisions in this regard. As the Secretary-General stresses in his report, a lack of clarity on this point carries inherent risks and can have serious future consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">Secondly, in the three-part process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, the third part is without doubt the most important. We must not confuse causes with symptoms: taking up arms is a way -- a violent way -- of responding to a situation such as underdevelopment, inequitable distribution of wealth, ethnic rivalry or political oppression. To permanently convince combatants to lay down their weapons and, more important, not to take them up again in the future, four guarantees are required: personal safety; equitable and effective political participation; genuine economic prospects for them to meet their needs and the needs of their families; and a social status as attractive as that of warrior, which they are being asked to renounce.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">My next point is that the international community must speedily demonstrate its firm resolve to contribute to the success of these programmes, and in particular to create the climate of confidence that is indispensable for success. A lasting commitment by the parties to a conflict to keep their commitments depends on this.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">We consider that there are three priority approaches in a strategy that must be comprehensive and long-term. I note that the Secretary-General has rightly stressed that any activities in this sphere must indeed be comprehensive and long-term.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">The first approach relates to adapting the mandates of peacekeeping operations. When a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process is deemed necessary, relevant provisions must appear in the mission mandate. It is important to understand the importance, as stressed by the Secretary-General, of involving the United Nations at the earliest possible stage in the process established by a peace agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">Secondly, there must be better coordination on the ground among all actors, something that has been mentioned by a number of other speakers. The mandates of peacekeeping operations that include a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration element must set out a clear division of labours and an effective allocation of responsibilities among all the organizations and all the actors involved in implementing the programme. During the peacekeeping phase, the special representative of the Secretary-General in the mission area should unequivocally assert his or her authority in this area and should understand his or her role as a coordinator.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">The third area is that of financing, as rightly mentioned by a number of delegations; the representative of the United Kingdom, for example, spoke of the problems now being faced in Sierra Leone. The fact is that the lack of financial resources too often causes the failure of a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, which cannot be completed because of this problem. It is particularly regrettable that these tasks -- which no one doubts are decisive for effective peace-building -- all too often depend on voluntary contributions, which by their very nature are unpredictable. There should be a more decisive joint effort so that, at least in the early stages, we can draw on the budgets of peacekeeping operations. The Secretary-General's initiatives regarding seed money for "quick impact projects" within the assessed budgets of peacekeeping operations deserve every encouragement.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">The presidential statement that will be issued following this debate must reflect our ongoing, determined commitment to the success of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes, particularly in a peacekeeping context. The report of the Secretary-General has helped us clearly to identify remaining obstacles and the objectives we should keep clearly in view. We fully support the presidential statement, and, as always, hope that its principles and recommendations will be implemented every time we deal with a case of this kind.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">Canada warmly welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the role of United Nations peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR). We thank the Secretary-General for his hard work in producing this constructive in-depth analysis, which will go a long way towards helping Canada and other members understand this crucial aspect of peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">This report gives a comprehensive account of many aspects of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration that are of very great concern to Canada. In particular, we appreciate the frankness with which the report describes shortcomings -- past and present -- of these programmes and we congratulate the Secretary-General for having clearly and convincingly turned these weak points into lessons that the Council can use in its work in post-conflict situations. We eagerly await the proposals that the Secretary-General will put before us in the future on this subject and we ask him to keep Council members abreast of future lessons learned by United Nations missions.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk03-pa01">Canada has long worked to make disarmament, demobilization and reintegration an accepted part of the <i>lingua franca </i>of post-conflict peace-building. We are proud contributors to many of the United Nations missions that broke new ground in integrating disarmament, demobilization and reintegration mechanisms into the work of peacekeepers and we have financially supported the work of the United Nations Lessons Learned Unit on the subject. We have particularly emphasized the importance of turning lessons learned into practice and have benefited greatly from the wisdom gained in past missions, by ourselves and others, in instilling these lessons into peacekeeping training, both nationally and at the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk03-pa02">We are therefore extremely pleased to see from this report that not only has it become an essential component of peacekeeping training, but that there also now exists genuine will on the part of Members to build on the progress made and include within the practice of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration a number of provisions critical to ensuring human security. We note most specifically the inclusion in recent missions of personnel dedicated to international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law, child and gender provisions, and child protection advisers tasked with giving special attention to war-affected children.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk03-pa03">We fully support the Secretary-General's view on the importance of integrating disarmament, demobilization and reintegration elements from the inception of peace agreements and on the importance of coordination among peacekeeping operations and agencies and others with expertise in the implementation of these programmes. We also support this report's conclusion that a multidimensional approach to post-conflict peace-building is vital. To be successful, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration must constitute part of a network of activities that encourage confidence in the future and give citizens, civilians and ex-combatants alike a stake in the continued stability of their country. This requires a commitment on the part of both the international community and the Government and people concerned to work together to improve governance, justice and human rights and to build the necessary political and physical infrastructure in support of this reform. Absent such a commitment, post-conflict peace-building processes too easily fall victim to the mistrust that causes conflict in the first place and that only grows with time.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk03-pa04">Many of the issues raised in this report are a function of the United Nations capacity for rapid and effective action. As the Secretary-General notes, the Security Council must be prepared to act quickly to take advantage of opportunities to promote the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants in post-conflict situations. Swift and substantive United Nations peacekeeping action lends credibility to the Organization's own efforts and to national initiatives. In order to include a meaningful disarmament, demobilization and reintegration component in peacekeeping mandates, the Council must show a genuine will to build a capacity for rapid and adequate deployment. Canada sees the need for DDR as one of the more persuasive reasons to work to ensure that all components of the United Nations system are seized of the imperative to afford peacekeeping operations adequate mandates for conflict and post-conflict situations and the necessary resource commitment to carry out their increasingly diverse tasks. We look forward to the work of the upcoming study on United Nations peace operations and will encourage the panel to examine these issues and build on the findings of the Secretary-General in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk03-pa05">The need for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration is felt most keenly in peace-building processes built on the tenuous trust of weary combatants. It is an ephemeral opportunity that offers few second chances. Our goal must therefore be to get it right the first time and to commit ourselves early and fully to these programmes and the peace processes that give rise to them. There are several conflict situations in the world at this moment that may soon require comprehensive disarmament and demobilization initiatives. We believe that this report will serve as an excellent means of informing the work of the international community as it addresses the role of the United Nations in post-conflict peace-building in these circumstances.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchynski</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">Ukraine welcomes today's discussion on the role of the United Nations in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants in a peacekeeping environment as a logical follow-up to a number of open debates held by the Security Council over the last two years on the issue of post-conflict peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">My delegation thanks the Secretary-General for preparing a truly comprehensive report which contains very useful assessments, definitions and suggestions on the matter under our consideration. Taking into account Ukraine's statements in previous debates in the Council on closely related subjects and the comprehensive character of the Secretary-General's report, I will confine myself to making a few comments and remarks.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">It is generally recognized that the relative decline in the frequency of inter-State armed conflicts in the post-cold-war era has caused the United Nations to focus more on the numerous internal conflicts. As a result, the evolution of United Nations peacekeeping has given birth to a new set of operations with multifunctional mandates to assist war-torn societies to move from violent conflicts towards reconciliation, economic reconstruction and democratic development.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Over the past decade, the United Nations has begun to deal more effectively with the problems of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants and accumulated invaluable experience in this field in a dozen of its peace-support operations around the globe. Ukraine has contributed to these international collective efforts, having participated in a number of United Nations operations and missions under DDR mandates, including those in Angola, Croatia and Guatemala. Currently, representatives of Ukraine serve with United Nations missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Tajikistan. Shortly, our representatives will join the staff of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">We consider that the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants is one of the most vital elements of ensuring the advancement of the whole peace process in conflict-riven societies. Like no other constituent part of international post-conflict efforts, DDR activities bear a direct relation to a very sensitive human aspect of the peace process, embracing former combatants and the entire affected population.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Evidently, the success or failure of the DDR process as a whole and of its particular elements is crucial to the further progress of peaceful efforts to achieve the final resolution of conflicts and to redress their consequences. We share the view expressed in paragraph 3 of the Secretary-General's report, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2000-101.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/101</a>, that the process of DDR</p>
	<blockquote id="pg017-bk01-pa07">"may have a symbolic and political importance beyond the sum of its parts",</blockquote>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">even if its full completion is hardly achievable.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">At the same time, there is no doubt that it is the parties to a conflict themselves that shoulder the primary responsibility for the implementation of DDR programmes. We could not agree more with the view of the Secretary-General that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg017-bk01-pa10">"the basis for a successful disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme should be laid within the peace agreement which provides for the end of a conflict." <i>(ibid., para. 13)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">In this context, I believe, the Kosovo conflict can serve as an instructive example of the negative effects of the absence of such a foundation. In our view, had the peace agreement with the provision on DDR been concluded by the parties to the Kosovo conflict, the results of the current peace process as a whole, and the demobilization of the Kosovo Liberation Army in particular, could by now have been far more satisfactory.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">Therefore, my delegation favours the idea of including within peace agreements the provisions outlining the commitments of the parties to a conflict to the DDR process. In this context, we also look forward to studying carefully the lessons-learned review of experiences with DDR, which was recently prepared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and circulated a few minutes ago.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa13">Ukraine remains gravely concerned about the problem of the impact of armed conflicts on children. We were appalled to read in the Secretary-General's report that an estimated 300,000 children are serving in armed conflicts around the world today. Again, Ukraine strongly condemns all acts of violence against children in international and internal armed conflicts and the horrendous practice of using children as instruments of war.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa14">Against this background, we agree with the evaluations and proposals made by the Secretary-General in his report on the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers. My delegation particularly welcomes the new initiative of the Secretariat to include the position of a child protection adviser in two United Nations operations: in Sierra Leone and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Undoubtedly, this practice should become permanent for all current and future United Nations peace-support operations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa15">We are satisfied with the completion last January, within the framework of the relevant Working Group, of the draft Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. Ukraine favours the earliest possible entry into force of this document, which would significantly strengthen the legal protection of children who are used as soldiers.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa16">In the context of disarmament, we support the idea of troop-contributing countries establishing a database of experts on DDR. Ukraine is ready to participate in this work by submitting a list of relevant candidates.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa17">In view of the direct impact of illicit arms flows on the DDR process in a peacekeeping environment, let me once again remind the Council of Ukraine's initiative to convene an meeting of international experts from major arms-producing countries, with a view to elaborating an effective mechanism to prevent the reselling of arms by the end users to third parties.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa18">My delegation remains convinced of the primary role of the United Nations as a coordinator and originator of guidelines for the DDR process, which could also be complemented by the efforts of regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa19">In conclusion, I would like to express the support of my delegation for the draft presidential statement which the Council will be adopting shortly. We hope that this document, as well as our discussion today, will further contribute to strengthening the United Nations capacities for post-conflict peace-building.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Bangladesh.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his excellent statement this morning and for his comprehensive report on the role of United Nations peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration -- commonly referred to as the DDR process.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">The effective disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants strengthen post-conflict peace-building and make peace sustainable. Increasingly, the United Nations peacekeeping operations are being mandated to facilitate the DDR process.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">Bangladesh agrees with the suggestions of the Secretary-General on the ways United Nations peacekeeping operations can support and strengthen the DDR process.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">But if the United Nations is to play a helpful role in this regard, the parties have to have the political will to commit themselves to peace, and the basis of the process should be laid within peace agreements that provide for the end of a conflict. Peace agreements should specify the responsibilities of the parties involved in the process and establish broad strategies and time-frames. We agree with the Secretary-General that where a United Nations peacekeeping role is envisioned, the United Nations should be represented in the peace negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">A second prerequisite for a successful DDR process is curbing the flow of arms in a post-conflict situation. If the flow of small arms and light weapons into the hands of belligerents continues unabated, there can never be successful disarmament. Efforts by the international community to this end are needed to ensure that while the parties involved are talking peace they are not preparing to resume war.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">Bangladesh believes that United Nations peacekeeping operations can ensure a successful DDR process by facilitating the safety and security of the DDR sites, the collection and disposal of weapons and ammunition, demining activities, the creation of an environment of confidence and trust, the reconstruction of war-affected infrastructure, and the prevention of violations of peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">To do this, peacekeeping operations must have clearly defined tasks in their mandates and should have adequate means, including a deterrent capacity and training, as well as appropriate personnel to undertake these tasks. Resources provided to peacekeeping operations must match their mandates, and innovative ways for addressing the question of financing have to be taken up. There is also a need to harmonize the efforts of peacekeeping operations with those of other agencies and organizations involved and for greater coordination among them so that reintegration efforts are addressed in a comprehensive manner.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">From our own experience in Bangladesh in successfully addressing this matter, we are convinced that only a comprehensive approach can result in effective disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants. The peace agreement concluded in 1997, regarding the Chittagong Hill Tracts, in south-east Bangladesh, provided autonomy to the region, mandated resettlement plans, addressed the question of land reform, ensured financing for development programmes that created livelihoods and jobs for the ex-combatants, and guaranteed the security of those who laid down their arms. The successful DDR process has enabled the region to experience economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">Before I conclude, I would like to raise one more important issue. We find it encouraging that the special needs of child soldiers and, more generally, of all war-affected children have been recognized by the Security Council and that institutional mechanisms are being arranged within peacekeeping operations to address them. The efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Olara Otunnu, have been most helpful in this regard. However, the needs of women ex-combatants have not been addressed with the urgency they deserve. We believe that it is time to take the matter up more urgently. It was really gratifying for us that, on International Women's Day earlier this month, the Council made a statement to the press on the situation of women in armed conflict. This was the first clear indication of the Council's concern, which provides strong support for the work that is being done in the Beijing + 5 process. We would urge the Secretary-General to keep this matter in mind.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Algeria. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I am particularly pleased to be speaking to the Council on behalf of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity at a time when you, Mr. President, have taken up your important duties with such distinction, talent and modesty. I should like to congratulate you sincerely and also take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Ambassador of Argentina for the success with which he presided over the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">I should also like to congratulate the Secretary-General for the comprehensive report before the Council and for the important statement he made this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">The debate that you, Sir, have taken the initiative of organizing in the Security Council on the question of post-conflict peace-building in general, and on aspects of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in particular, is all the more timely -- and, we hope, useful -- in taking place at a time when, mindful of the growing complexity of peacekeeping operations our Secretary-General has taken the initiative of establishing a group to consider this question as a whole. It is a question whose importance goes beyond the strict framework of peacekeeping, inasmuch as it influences the length of time that conflict settlement and the gradual return to peace and stability will take.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">The concept of peacekeeping has been constantly evolving and gradually changing in recent years with regard to both the proliferation of operations involving United Nations forces and resources and the very way in which such operations are understood, because their scope is expanding to encompass aspects that are relatively new, compared to how we looked at this issue not long ago.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">The reasons for this development lie, first and foremost, in the changed nature of the conflicts in which the international community is being asked to intervene. For about 10 years now, most conflicts and crises have been internal and, often, inter-ethnic in nature, characterized by large-scale massacres and refugee flows. The United Nations, having been found wanting in Rwanda, Bosnia and elsewhere, can no longer allow such developments to occur with impunity.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">Furthermore, while the role of the United Nations in inter-State conflicts is limited to separating the belligerent parties, placing itself between them, supervising the disengagement of the forces involved and monitoring truces, in the case of internal conflicts the mandate of United Nations forces must be broader and, as a result, more complex. Not only does it now have to separate the belligerent parties, but it has to work to eliminate the factors that might lead to a resumption of hostilities. Experience acquired in recent years in this area has led us to the realization that the mandate of peacekeeping operations must now include post-conflict peace-building elements in order to prevent a resumption of hostilities. Such measures include the disarmament of troops and militias that are not recognized as legal forces, the collection of weapons illegally held by ex-combatants, the demobilization of ex-combatants and their reintegration into society.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">Furthermore, even if the conflicts facing the United Nations are internal in nature, they often involve several actors in the immediate vicinity of the country concerned, and even outside the region itself, which makes it even more difficult to deal with such problems and to settle conflicts and sometimes creates risks for the United Nations forces being deployed.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">The growing reluctance of some countries to participate in peacekeeping operations, especially in Africa, has led to the greater involvement of regional organizations. This makes even more acute the problem of the relationship between the United Nations and regional peacekeeping organizations, against the backdrop of the problem of financing operations and the material, logistic and military capacities of the regional organizations in playing their new role.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">In his report of 11 February 2000, entitled "The role of United Nations peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration", the Secretary-General goes into great detail about the purpose of these activities and their potential importance to the future conduct of peacekeeping operations and, consequently, to the future of all efforts to make peace and settle conflicts. We are very grateful to the Secretary-General for his analysis, which, based on experience gained by the United Nations in recent years, provides us with a set of useful and essential tools for gaining a better idea of how effectively to organize the work of the United Nations in this area. These elements relate to such important aspects as the coordination of efforts being made in this process, the mobilization of resources, capacity-building for United Nations personnel and the establishment, in general terms, of an international and local environment conducive to such work.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">Post-conflict peace-building transcends the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration because it encompasses the search for equitable, reliable and credible solutions to the political, economic and social problems at the heart of these very conflicts. This is therefore long-term work, combining real political will at the local and, sometimes, at the regional level with the consistent support of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">There is no point in silencing weapons and establishing a relative peace that is often maintained only by the presence of neutral peacekeeping forces, unless, at the same time, we courageously and resolutely attack the very origins of the conflict and try to deal appropriately with their causes.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa12">Consequently, as the Secretary-General pointed out so clearly in his report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa, many conflicts in newly independent States seem to be the result of extreme poverty, which provides the ideal breeding ground not only for the growth and nurturing of fanaticism and violence, but for the seizure of power by force, the absence of democracy and the consequent lack of prospects for democratic change. Combined with external factors, this can sometimes lead to the outbreak of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa13">Post-conflict peace-building must, increasingly, be part of a new approach based on traditional peacekeeping activities, accompanied by an ambitious peace-building programme built on the resumption of economic activities, electoral assistance, the rehabilitation of public institutions, the establishment of a national, integrated and representative army, and, sometimes, the convening of regional conferences.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa14">This action on the part of the United Nations can clearly succeed only if the internal, and eventually regional, context is favourable. This means that there must first be genuine national reconciliation, which itself must result from a negotiated political settlement based on power-sharing and the strengthening of democratic practices. This also means that when neighbouring States are involved, their support is desirable, if not necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa15">The facts on the ground, we must admit, are much more complex, and the situation is more difficult to control, particularly with respect to the disarmament of ex-combatants, where lack of trust, fueled by years of war and the absence of any genuine will to cooperate on the part of the rebel leaders, often gives rise to insoluble problems.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa16">The problems encountered by the disarmament and demobilization programme involving the UNITA rebels in Angola in the context of the Lusaka Protocol were the principal cause of the resumption of hostilities between that movement and the Angolan Government forces and consequently of the withdrawal from the country of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), which took place in February 1999. UNITA actually used the peace process to build up its military capacity and to start acquiring mass quantities of new weapons. In addition, the arms handed over by Mr. Savimbi's troops under the disarmament programme were often obsolete and, in any case, only a tiny percentage of those weapons were actually handed over to the United Nations. Clearly, in the case of Angola, monitoring and follow-up of this aspect of the peace agreements was neither effective nor conclusive.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa17">The many problems now facing the process of disarmament and demobilization of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone within the context of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) are evidence of the problems faced by the United Nations on the ground. During the public meeting of the Council on 13 March last, it was clearly established that the RUF forces and their chief, Mr. Sankoh, in particular, were not cooperating in the handing over of all of their weapons to the United Nations Mission under the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, as established by the Lom Peace Agreement of 7 July 1999. Quite the contrary -- the quantity, and particularly the quality and nature, of the arms handed over by RUF elements -- in some cases only ammunition or hand grenades -- leads one to believe that the real weapons are still in the hands of the movement, in violation of the agreements concluded.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa18">Since we are speaking of Sierra Leone, I should like to touch on the question of child soldiers. Their demobilization and reintegration must be given particular consideration because they are so vulnerable and because of the serious traumas they have suffered in wartime. Very fortunately, in recent years we have seen positive experiences, for example, with respect to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique, or, more recently, in the framework of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic. In both cases the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, which in Mozambique led to the establishment of a national army and in the Central African Republic to the restructuring of a pre-existing army, on the whole was successful. To a large extent it enabled the process of peace and reconciliation to make significant progress and the countries concerned gradually to return to a situation of peace and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa19">In both cases, respect by the parties to the conflict of their commitments went a long way towards ensuring the success of the operation, even if the process that was begun in the Central African Republic by the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB), followed by the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic, has not been finalized completely.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa20">In Kosovo, the determination shown by the international community and the significant resources provided made possible the disarmament of UCK combatants and opened the way to an international effort towards peace-building and a return to normalcy in that region. In this specific case, as I said earlier, significant political, military and human resources were utilized and went a long way towards facilitating the job on the ground, even if the disarmament campaign has not yet been fully finalized, as evidenced by the difficulties encountered by the United Nations in the last few weeks.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa21">We hope that the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) will show the same determination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Under the Lusaka Agreement, the demobilization and disarmament of about 10 armed movements, which are specifically mentioned in paragraph 9.1 of the Agreement, should be accorded special attention because of their repercussions on the follow-up to operations. Both the parties to the Lusaka Agreement, through the Joint Military Commission, and the United Nations, through MONUC, must play an active role to ensure the demobilization of those armed groups -- which are rampant in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the region -- and the implementation of the provisions of the Accord relating to them.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa22">In this respect, we cannot but express our serious concern at the recent deterioration of the military situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we solemnly call on the parties concerned scrupulously to observe the cease-fire and to honour their Lusaka commitments in order to ensure the full and prompt implementation of the 10 July 1999 agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa23">The same effort should be made by the Congolese parties to the Agreement and by MONUC, so that the process of establishing a restructured and integrated national army can take place under normal conditions and be concluded within a reasonable time period. Assistance, and financial assistance in particular, from the international community will no doubt be necessary in order to support and speed up the process.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa24">Disarmament operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are made even more difficult by the fact that the situation in the country is related to a regional and international problem that will be the subject of a United Nations conference in 2001: the illicit circulation of small arms and, in some cases, the violation of arms embargoes imposed by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa25">The proliferation of armed groups and bands in the Great Lakes region has been made possible in recent years by the availability of significant and uncontrollable quantities of arms. The lessons learned from recent experience highlight the difficulty of making real progress in the areas of demobilization and disarmament if we do not control and channel these illicit flows of arms, which foster tension and make it possible for various rival groups to rearm and to rebuild their potential to wage war.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa26">It is therefore essential that, simultaneously with the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the framework of MONUC, the question of the illegal circulation of weapons in the Great Lakes region be considered based on a regional approach, and that the effectiveness of the arms embargo imposed by the Council on groups in the region be the subject of constant scrutiny and improvement.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa27">The implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, particularly in Africa, relates to a crucial problem that recent experience has highlighted: the financing of operations to reintegrate ex-combatants. This is the third phase of the process -- after demobilization and disarmament -- and, despite its important and decisive impact on the success of the entire post-conflict peace-building effort, it has thus far not been dealt with properly on an ongoing basis.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa28">It is regrettable that the financing of these programmes, and in particular the aspect relating to the reintegration of ex-combatants into civil society, is dependent on special trust funds and on international appeals. The unpredictable nature of these funds contrasts with the importance of the overall financial effort deployed in the context of the peacekeeping operation, considering that the financing of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration represents a relatively small amount compared to the overall resources committed.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa29">In our view, this situation deserves in-depth discussion on how the financing of these programmes can as a rule be included in peacekeeping budgets, particularly with regard to the reintegration component. Once the burden of having to find financing had been lifted, the implementation of these extremely important programmes could then be carried out according to a predetermined plan and finalized by offering ex-combatants in the programmes the possibility of true reintegration into productive society.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa30">After this relatively brief overview, I would like to share with the Council some observations that I hope will be useful to its deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa31">First, the inclusion of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes into peacekeeping operations should take place on the basis of a clear, concerted approach that includes the authorities of the country concerned as an element of the post-conflict peace-building effort. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration measures can take place only within the framework of a broader programme and as part of an effective and ambitious peace-building strategy. Those measures, which are essentially operational in nature and aimed at preventing a resumption of hostilities, should be part of a more global vision that addresses deals with the real causes of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa32">Secondly, this comprehensive vision requires at least two essential conditions. First of all, disarmament and demobilization should be carried out by the parties to a peace or ceasefire agreement and through direct cooperation with the United Nations peacekeeping mission, which should have a sufficiently broad mandate to enable it to carry out its tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa33">Reintegration should then be given greater attention, for the reasons we have given here, and should in future be financed through United Nations mission resources and no longer on the basis of voluntary contributions, which are so unpredictable and often fall short of the requirements of operations. It remains understood that the practice of setting up special trust funds could be continued, but such funds should provide assistance supplementary to the main effort.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa34">Thirdly, the mobilization of adequate financial and technical resources by international financial institutions, in particular by the World Bank, should be encouraged and steadily continued so as to ensure the significant support of these institutions for the efforts of the international community. The other programmes and agencies of the United Nations system -- such as the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Health Organization -- should continue to play an important role in providing expertise and resources, while they seek to improve coordination of their activities.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa35">Finally, the inclusion of post-conflict peace-building elements in the mandates of peacekeeping operations should not be seen merely as an operational measure to support the peacekeeping effort and to prevent the spread of conflict or the resurgence of war.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa36">While operational imperatives and the need to take quick decisions mean that the Security Council must assume a leading role, it should be pointed out that peace-building activities are not and cannot be the sole purview of the Security Council. The General Assembly has a key role to play here. We should recall that, during the discussions held in response to the proposals contained in the Secretary-General's 1995 "Supplement to an Agenda for Peace", a clear majority of Member States said they were in favour of entrusting these activities to the General Assembly. However, for practical and other reasons having to do with respect for the prerogatives and competencies of each of the United Nations bodies, the Economic and Social Council must be involved every time a question touches on economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa37">At the dawn of this new millennium, the universal mission of the United Nations is being increasingly validated and reinforced, thereby giving the Organization broader activities and missions to carry out in the service of the community of nations. Post-conflict peace-building, given the diversity of the missions and actions it encompasses, must take place in a political context and optimal operational conditions in order to be effective. That context requires, among other things, the full and ongoing cooperation of the parties concerned and, clearly, of regional organizations. In this regard, the Organization of African Unity is prepared not only to make its contribution, but also to provide its commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa38">However essential these conditions may be, they should not be at the expense of another equally essential element: steadfast and scrupulous respect for the independence and sovereignty of the States concerned in these processes. Those principles are clearly established in the Charter that governs our Organization. In manifesting such respect, United Nations missions would enjoy greater support throughout the world and would, thanks to that legitimacy and support, gain credibility and effectiveness.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of South Africa. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kumalo</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa01">I would like to thank you, Mr. President for holding this meeting today.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa02">We who hail from a conflict-ridden continent and who have seen the colossal human tragedies of conflict fully appreciate the convening of this meeting on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, commonly known as DDR. For us, this is an important issue that deserves this body's undivided attention for a number of reasons.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa03">First, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants in the aftermath of conflict is increasingly placing more demands and challenges on peacekeeping operations, making it more imperative that we redefine the role and scope of contemporary United Nations peacekeeping operations. In this regard, South Africa believes that it no longer serves any good purpose to insist on an approach to peacekeeping that does not, where appropriate, include DDR. This would render peacekeeping moribund in relation to the actual challenges on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa04">Secondly, DDR is proving every day to be an important and necessary process in stabilizing post-conflict situations and in preventing the recurrence of conflict at both the intra-State and regional levels; hence, it is an important tool in the maintenance of international peace and security. It is therefore more imperative now than ever before to consider the early integration of DDR into United Nations peacekeeping mandates, where applicable. The lack of timely and decisive DDR programmes in United Nations peacekeeping operations is bound to have a negative impact on the United Nations ability to really end the recurrence of conflict. We have seen throughout the world that such delays and lack of resolute action on DDR perpetuates polarization, making timely conflict prevention, management and resolution more difficult.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa05">Thirdly, DDR provides an important bridge in the transition from the cessation of hostilities to sustainable peace by incorporating political, security, economic and social objectives. This demonstrates the need to desist from theorizing on what United Nations peacekeeping should be when our people, in the words of the Secretary-General,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg024-bk03-pa06">"need a real and sustained commitment to help end their cycles of violence, and launch them on a safe passage to prosperity".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa07">Rather, our efforts should focus on ensuring that there are clearly defined mandates with adequate resources where DDR programmes are to be undertaken in United Nations peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa08">It would be inappropriate to place squarely on the United Nations the responsibility for ensuring the success of DDR programmes. It is for this reason that South Africa strongly believes that, for the sake of their political legitimacy and in order to facilitate their timely implementation, DDR programmes should be strongly anchored in peace agreements that end conflicts. My delegation joins the call that parties concerned in fostering post-conflict stability should demonstrate the necessary political will by committing themselves to peace. It is of utmost importance that parties honour and adhere to the commitments they have made in reaching a peace agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa09">Likewise, political leaders must genuinely commit themselves to reconciliation through practical confidence-building measures that demonstrate this commitment. In this regard, a commitment to guarantee the security of those former combatants who decide to lay down their weapons must be made an integral part of DDR programmes, including the special needs of children, and in particular child soldiers, as well as of women and the elderly. The difficult decision that these former combatants make and the vulnerable situation that they place themselves in should always be borne in mind. Their former comrades who do not make the courageous decision to lay down their arms often see them as traitors. They can therefore become the victims of their former brothers and sisters in arms as they await integration while in encampment areas.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa10">Because of its wide scope, complexity and fragility, DDR also requires the support of the international community in order to succeed. In this regard, my delegation recommends that all efforts should be made to include other, non-United Nations institutions in the implementation of DDR programmes. This mammoth task can no longer be faced by the United Nations without the help of others.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa11">The report of the Secretary-General before us on the role of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration offers useful ground on which to begin our work on this complex subject. South Africa attaches great value to this report, which provides us with a definition of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration within a peacekeeping environment, as well as practical suggestions on how the United Nations machinery could strengthen this in pursuit of more effective United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building activities.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa12">We also believe that the proposal of the recently concluded session of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations also offers practical suggestions on this issue. Its recommendation that the Secretariat should formalize lessons learned on DDR programmes that have made a valuable contribution to peace and regional stability should be pursued.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk03-pa13">In conclusion, my delegation looks forward to the convening of the informal meeting of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, to be held some time this year, as envisaged in the Committee's recent report. We believe that the Special Committee should focus on this issue, which falls within its mandate, as it is the only United Nations forum tasked with reviewing comprehensively the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects. We believe that the views expressed at this meeting will be helpful in defining our approach not only to DDR, but to other peacekeeping-related issues as well.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Portugal. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Monteiro</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated countries, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European Free Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area, Iceland and Liechtenstein, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">The European Union commends the Security Council, under your guidance, Mr. President, for holding a formal meeting on this important subject of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in the context of peacekeeping.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">The European Union expresses its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his statement this morning and for the excellent report he has prepared on the role of United Nations peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, in response to the request made by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 8 July 1999, following the open debate held the same day on the matter. It is gratifying to note that the treatment of this important issue is being given appropriate continuity by the Security Council and the Secretary-General, particularly in the context of United Nations peacekeeping.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">In this regard, the European Union also recalls the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, approved on 10 March 2000 and to be issued, which notes this report of the Secretary-General and addresses certain issues related to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes and United Nations peacekeeping.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">The report of the Secretary-General represents a comprehensive review of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, the role they play in establishing conditions for a long-lasting peace and in post-conflict peace-building, and the role United Nations peacekeeping operations can play in the conduct of these activities. The European Union endorses in general terms the goals established in the report and urges that appropriate follow-up be given to the recommendations contained therein by the Security Council and relevant United Nations departments and agencies, as well as by other organizations and by Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">As the Secretary-General points out, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities can represent the window of opportunity to advance a peace process, a window that may close if the international community does not swiftly and vigorously act by providing the United Nations with the necessary political support and adequate resources to pursue on the ground the mandate that has been given by the Security Council. It is interesting that all these points were reaffirmed in the Fifth Committee this morning, at its resumed session.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">Like other essential activities that complement the efforts of peacekeeping operations, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes must be effectively integrated into multidisciplinary peacekeeping operations when they have been mandated. The European Union also believes that the most effective way to ensure this is for such programmes to be determined in the peace agreement that provides for the end of a conflict. As the Secretary-General has pointed out, this would ensure the clarity and timely implementation of the programmes and build confidence among the parties. The role of the Security Council in this regard is to reflect the importance attributed to these programmes by calling for the necessary expertise and resources to be made available.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">As requested, the Secretary-General paid particular attention in his report to the problems of child soldiers. When dealing with this issue, we must have the best interests of these children uppermost in our minds. By identifying the existence of child soldiers at the outset in the peace agreement and by addressing their concerns in the implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, as the Secretary-General suggests, we will be moving towards that goal, particularly in the long term. Nothing is gained from denying their existence and perpetuating their unfortunate condition, which can only augur badly for a long-lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">The European Union fully endorses the Secretary-General's recommendations with regard to child soldiers in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, particularly with respect to strengthening the performance of United Nations peacekeeping in addressing the special needs of children, and it welcomes the declared policy of including within all operations, where relevant, personnel with appropriate training in international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law, including child-related and gender-related provisions. The European Union also shares the Secretary-General's recommendation that a holistic and long-term view be taken of the demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers, comprising social and economic aspects of the problem.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">The Secretary-General has usefully identified the ways in which United Nations peacekeeping can assist in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes. Drawing on its impartial character and universal legitimacy, United Nations peacekeeping can play a crucial role in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes by building confidence and trust, by conveying a sense of security, by sustaining momentum and by channelling expertise.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa11">The report shows clearly how peacekeepers participate actively in the process of disarmament of combatants -- from the monitoring of ceasefires and the separation of forces to the supervision of disarmament sites, and from taking custody of surrendered weapons to the destruction of arms and addressing the problem of arms flows into a conflict area. They also have a role to play in monitoring and verifying the demobilization of troops and in providing security for quartered personnel. In the reintegration process, peacekeepers can assist in the transportation of former combatants to their homes and in the distribution of "reinsertion" packages to allow former soldiers to begin a civilian life.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa12">But the Secretary-General is also right to point out that, while peacekeeping operations play a crucial role, the ultimate success of a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process may require sustained efforts long after the withdrawal of a multidisciplinary peacekeeping operation. It is therefore necessary to take a long-term perspective on how the process is to be carried out, identify clearly the role of the peacekeeping operation in that process, provide it with the necessary resources and ensure the continuation of the process beyond the end of the peacekeeping mandate. Essential to those goals is the effective coordination of efforts in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, both at Headquarters and in the field, as well as with other United Nations agencies and international organizations crucial to these activities. An obvious model of such an approach -- which would, of course, need to be adapted to each circumstance -- is the activities of the United Nations in Mozambique, as the Secretary-General's clear references to that success story indicate.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa13">The European Union looks forward to seeing the results of the work of the Lessons Learned Unit of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations on the elaboration of a set of principles and guidelines for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa14">In the context of wide-ranging European Union support for peace processes and peace-building activities, financial and in-kind contributions and support for capacity-building have been provided by States members of the European Union to, <i>inter alia</i>, demobilization and reintegration programmes in the Central African Republic and in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa15">With regard to disarmament, the European Union attaches great importance to the particular problems caused by the alarming increase and spread of small arms and light weapons. The European Union adopted a joint action approach to small arms in December 1998, with a view to building consensus in the appropriate regional and international forums on the necessary principles and measures as the basis for regional and incremental approaches to the problem and, where appropriate, global international instruments on small arms. The European Union continues actively to pursue this approach and particularly looks forward to the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be convened in the summer of 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa16">The European Union is also undertaking specific actions, through financial and technical assistance to programmes and projects related to small arms problems, notably in Albania, Cambodia and Mozambique, and we are considering specific action in other areas as well. The European Union is also providing assistance to the small arms moratorium put in place by the Economic Community of West African States, which seeks to prevent the illicit manufacture and trade of small arms and to ensure that these weapons are collected and put out of use.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa17">A valuable tool in this area is the set of guidelines adopted by consensus by the United Nations Disarmament Commission in April 1999 on conventional arms control/limitation and disarmament with particular emphasis on consolidation of peace. The guidelines contain specific recommendations for the collection, control, disposal and destruction of arms, especially small arms and light weapons, and for the conversion of military facilities. They address the criteria required for a successful and well organized programme for the demobilization of combatants as well as measures needed for their effective integration into civil society. These guidelines can assist the international community, as well as regions, subregions and countries directly affected, in this area, and should be drawn upon in the design of mandates for future United Nations peacekeeping or preventive operations. In this context, we also acknowledge the importance of the recommendations of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa18">The European Union supports the specific recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his report with a view to strengthening the role of United Nations peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. To assist the United Nations in providing the necessary expertise for such difficult tasks, the European Union supports the maintenance of databases of expertise on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and the inclusion of these areas in national training programmes for peacekeepers. This would help overcome the difficulties sometimes experienced by the United Nations in locating experienced disarmament experts and trainers for United Nations peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa19">Attentive consideration should also be given to the question of offering incentives for disarmament, to the destruction of weapons and to the monitoring and control of regional arms traffic, taking into account the economic dimensions of arms flows. In this context, the European Union especially welcomes the work and the initiatives of the group of interested States. That group supports concrete projects of practical disarmament, including in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and serves as a forum for the exchange of information about relevant lessons learned in this field. The initiative has the support of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa20">With regard to the demobilization process, the report rightly emphasizes the importance of giving peacekeeping operations a strong political role and ample resources, including a deterrent capacity. The European Union agrees with the Secretary-General that demobilization and reintegration programmes need to be placed on a firmer financial footing and that provision also needs to be made for special measures for child soldiers. The European Union invites the Secretary-General to explore with, <i>inter alia</i>, Member States and the World Bank, a range of possible options, and to make further detailed recommendations on this subject, as necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa21">United Nations peacekeeping operations can also play a crucial role, as the Secretary-General has described, in the creation of the physical, political and social infrastructures necessary for successful reintegration programmes. In this regard, the activities of United Nations peacekeeping operations in institution-building, elections, human rights and the judicial system, including the police, are vital.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa22">In view of the lead responsibility of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for multidimensional peacekeeping operations, coordination within the Secretariat and with relevant agencies within the United Nations system, as well as with regional organizations, intergovernmental bodies, bilateral programmes and non-governmental organizations, is essential to the success of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and should continue to be strengthened. In the same sphere, the consolidation of the authority of special representatives over all United Nations entities is most welcome and should be further strengthened by the appointment of resident coordinators as deputies to heads of mission.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa23">This is an important report and will serve amply to continue to develop the vital capacity of the United Nations in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. At stake is the long-term resolution of conflicts; these activities are a small price to pay for peace.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kolby</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">From Kosovo to the Congo, from Sierra Leone to East Timor, the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of former combatants is playing an increasingly important role in United Nations peace operations.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">Norway would therefore like to commend the Security Council and you, Mr. President, for calling this formal meeting, and to thank the Secretary-General for an excellent report on the subject. We would also like to commend the delegation of Malaysia for its efforts. Norway fully supports the objectives and recommendations of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">Following armed conflict, particularly internal conflicts, a comprehensive approach to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration is necessary in order to prevent the recurrence of violence. Incorporating political, security, economic and social objectives, DDR provides a bridge from the cessation of hostilities to sustainable peace. As such, DDR must not only focus on short-term demobilization programmes, but also be an integral part of the longer-term process of reconciling formerly hostile communities and reintegrating ex-combatants, with a special emphasis on child soldiers and other vulnerable groups.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">It is essential that United Nations officials and others who take part in DDR verification operations have in-depth knowledge of all the mechanisms involved in this process. Excellent work has been done by the United Nations and other organizations and countries to strengthen education and training. The Lessons Learned Unit study on DDR in a peacekeeping environment is among the substantial contributions to this work. Norway is pleased to have had the opportunity to support this study and will participate in its follow-up.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">One important aspect is the security of ex-combatants who comply with United Nations requests to hand in their weapons. For many, this is a difficult choice. Their comrades who do not make this courageous decision often see them as traitors. They can therefore become victims, of aggression not only by former enemies, but also by former brothers in arms. To avoid a situation where those who comply with United Nations requests are in fact punished, the security of disarmed soldiers must be an integral part of any DDR programme.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa06">The proliferation, misuse and excessive accumulation of small arms and light weapons is an area of great concern in carrying out peace operations. Most contemporary conflicts have been fought with small arms and light weapons; international humanitarian law is often disregarded and civilians, as well as humanitarian operations and United Nations and other personnel, are often targeted. Proper safeguarding or destruction of post-conflict stockpiles of small arms and light weapons can alleviate such problems. Norway renders support to individual States, regional and multilateral organizations requiring assistance in weapons collection and destruction programmes. In this connection, Norway supports the United Nations Development Programme's trust fund for weapons collection, which is providing development for communities in return for arms they surrender. Furthermore, it is important that disarmament and weapons destruction be incorporated as an element of peace settlements and that peace operations are given clear mandates in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa07">Funding for DDR activities is a crucial challenge and responsibility for the international community. Inadequate financial support can undermine peace implementation efforts. Norway will continue to provide a high level of voluntary contributions to the activities of the United Nations system in this field. My Government intends to further increase our assistance to peace-building efforts in Sierra Leone and elsewhere, particularly in Africa, in line with our large and long-standing engagement in that region. Like the Secretary-General and other speakers, Norway is encouraged by the experience of Mozambique and would like to commend the United Nations and the Government of Mozambique for the successful efforts made.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa08">As the Secretary-General points out, reintegration represents a particularly complex part of the DDR process. The support of the international community for national plans for reconciliation, reconstruction and long-term social and economic development is crucial in order to persuade ex-combatants to rejoin civil society and thus to obtain lasting peace. In the view of the Norwegian Government, combating poverty and underdevelopment is vital to preventing conflicts and their recurrence. The international donor community must follow up on the Secretary-General's call for increased development assistance to get at the root causes of violent conflicts. My Government is committed to continue Norway's efforts in this regard.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kobayashi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">I would like to begin by commending you, Mr. President, on your initiative in convening this meeting to consider ways and means of strengthening United Nations peacekeeping efforts in the area of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR). The importance of the DDR process cannot be overemphasized, as it is key to preventing the recurrence of conflict and to paving the way for post-conflict peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">My delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General for preparing the thorough and inspiring report that is before us; we fully share the concerns described in it. As one of the financial contributors to the study conducted by the Lessons Learned Unit, Japan is particularly gratified that many elements contained in the Unit's report have been incorporated into that of the Secretary-General. We are also pleased to note that the report embraces many of the recommendations made by the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms, under the chairmanship of Ambassador Donowaki of Japan.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">Of the wide range of issues covered in the Secretary-General's report, I would like to focus my remarks on three of them -- namely, the need for greater coordination, the need to address the question of child soldiers and ways to secure adequate financial resources.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">The first point is the question of coordination. As stated in the report, the process of DDR is a complex and multidimensional one, involving various actors such as former warring factions, international organizations and non-governmental organizations. Coordination among the different actors is essential to the success of the process. From the viewpoint of ex-combatants, for example, the decision to cooperate with the DDR process is in itself a difficult one, and so it is up to the international community to ensure that a well-planned, coordinated and reliable mechanism is in place to support that decision.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">In order to achieve this goal, coordination must be improved at three levels: within the United Nations Secretariat, between the United Nations and related organizations -- including the Bretton Woods institutions -- and in the field. Of those three levels, I would like to stress the need for coordination in the field, as this is the level at which all actors finally get together and directly face ex-combatants who are to be disarmed, demobilized and reintegrated into society.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">The Special Representative of the Secretary-General has an especially important coordinating role to play. Past experience has taught us that when a Special Representative is well selected and is given appropriate authority and resources, coordination in the field is enhanced, making the chances for success that much greater. We therefore wish to stress that the position of Special Representative should be filled by a highly qualified and capable person and that he or she should be given sufficient authority to effectively carry out the role.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">My second point relates to the issue of child soldiers. My delegation shares the view of the Secretary-General that this question demands particular attention throughout the DDR process. Children are the foundation and future of a country, and the specific physical and psychological needs of those who have been used as soldiers must be attended to if the country is to achieve lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">In this context, my delegation welcomes the recent appointment of child protection advisers to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone and to the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We would like to encourage the Secretary-General to review other United Nations peacekeeping operations in order to identify situations where the appointment of child protection advisers may be necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa09">Permit me on this occasion to reiterate the position of the Government of Japan that children under the age of 18 should not, under any circumstances, be used in hostilities. Japan strongly supports the draft Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted by a Working Group of the Human Rights Commission in January.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa10">My final point concerns financial resources needed for the DDR process, although I realize that financial matters are also dealt with in other relevant forums of the Organization. As the Secretary-General pointed out, the resources for disarmament activities within a peacekeeping operation are generally provided through the assessed contributions to the budget of that operation, while the resources for demobilization and reintegration activities are provided through voluntary contributions. My delegation recognizes that the current practice of utilizing resources from trust funds established with voluntary contributions for such purposes has its merits. As a matter of fact, Japan contributed $960,000 to the Trust Fund to support United Nations peacekeeping-related efforts in Sierra Leone, to be used exclusively for the purpose of DDR. Although by virtue of its flexibility this trust fund formula has proved to be useful, we recognize that providing the necessary resources from the assessed budget would enhance an operation's financial stability.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa11">Bearing in mind these considerations, I would like to stress that Japan, which is responsible for 20 percent of the assessed budget of all peacekeeping operations, is willing to consider a proposal which the Secretary-General put forward in his report to examine how the DDR activities in a peacekeeping operation should be financed.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa12">In concluding, let me once again underscore the importance my delegation attaches to today's debate in the Security Council. I might add that the concerns expressed by the Council at its previous meeting on this subject, in July of last year, and the points made in the Secretary-General's report are fully consonant with the position my delegation has been advocating in other forums of the United Nations, such as the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, the First Committee and the preparatory committee for the international Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons. You may be assured, Mr. President, that Japan will actively participate in the consideration of this issue and make every effort to enhance the chances of success of the DDR process.</p>
