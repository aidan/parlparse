	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Iraq that targeted the democratically elected Council of Representatives. The Security Council expresses its deep sympathy and condolences to the victims of this heinous act of terrorism and their families, and to the people and the Government of Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council underlines the need to bring perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism to justice, and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the Iraqi authorities in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council further reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. The Council reminds States that they must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council strongly supports efforts to promote national dialogue, reconciliation and broad political participation in ensuring unity, peace, security and stability in Iraq. Furthermore, the Security Council demands that those who use violence in an attempt to subvert the political process must cease hostilities, lay down their arms and participate in that process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council reaffirms its continued support for the Iraqi people and Government as they rebuild their country and strengthen the foundations of sustainable peace, constitutional democracy, and social and economic progress."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-11.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/11</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
