	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01"> Members will recall that when we adjourned the meeting this morning, the Assembly was considering paragraph 58 of the report of the General Committee regarding the recommendation of the General Committee on item 165 of the draft agenda, urging the Security Council to process Taiwan's membership application pursuant to rules 59 and 60 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council and to Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">We have 43 speakers still inscribed on the list for this afternoon. I would therefore strongly appeal to members to be as brief as possible in their statements on this subject so that we may finalize our work on the report this afternoon.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Menan</span> <span class="nation">Togo</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">Like numerous delegations that took the floor earlier, the Togolese delegation has always supported the principle of one China -- one and indivisible -- in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations pertaining to the territorial integrity of States. Togo is of the view that Taiwan is an integral part of China, and the issue of the admission of Taiwan as a Member of the United Nations is something that would seriously compromise international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">In addition, Togo is pleased to number the People's Republic of China among its many partners, and a partner with whom only two days ago we celebrated the thirty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. As a result, Togo welcomes the decision taken by the Committee not to take up this issue on the agenda for the current session of the General Assembly. In this regard, Togo fully supports the declaration made by the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China and counts itself firmly among those countries that stand up for the principle of respect for the provisions of resolution 2758 (XXVI), recognizing the Government of the People's Republic as the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people to the United Nations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wolfe</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">Let me commence by saying that Jamaica had the benefit, as a member of the General Committee, of having actively participated in the informal and formal meetings of the Committee when this item was considered. Thus, we strongly endorse the decision taken by the General Committee in respect of item 165 of the draft agenda. Let me go on to say that Jamaica firmly adheres to the People's Republic of China's one-China foreign policy, a policy that the Government of Jamaica has consistently supported since the People's Republic of China joined the United Nations and the subsequent establishment of diplomatic relations between Jamaica and the People's Republic of China in 1972. The Government of Jamaica continues to regard the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of the people of China and affirms its high regard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">Accordingly, our Government does not recognize any separate entity purporting to represent the people of China in the United Nations and other multilateral forums or whose representation could cause a deviation from the one-China policy.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hackett</span> <span class="nation">Barbados</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">I am taking the floor to speak in support of the recommendation of the General Committee contained in paragraph 58 of its report (<a href="../pdf/A-62-250.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/250</a>). The recommendation is in keeping with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as well as with General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI), and it reflects the will of the overwhelming majority of Member States. Given the fact that the majority of the world's nations recognize and adhere to the principle of one China, to which Barbados fully subscribes, Barbados is of the view that there should be no need for the General Assembly to debate the Taiwan issue at every session of the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">We are of the belief that resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted at the twenty-sixth session of the Assembly, in 1971, has resolved the issue of China's representation in the United Nations politically, legally and in terms of procedure. In accordance with that resolution, the Government of Barbados considers that the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only legitimate representatives of China in the United Nations. That resolution, we further believe, should serve as the legal basis and political principle guiding the United Nations and its affiliated agencies in handing Taiwan-related issues.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">Since 1993, the General Committee, at successive sessions of the General Assembly, has unequivocally refused to include the so-called issue of Taiwan's participation in the United Nations in the agenda of the Assembly. The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization composed of sovereign States, and maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States are among the cardinal principles enshrined in its Charter. Barbados therefore believes that the Taiwan question should be resolved by the Chinese people themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">We fully support the statement made by the Permanent Representative of China on this issue.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Duale</span> <span class="nation">Somalia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">I take this opportunity warmly to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We wholeheartedly support his presidency. We also thank his immediate predecessor, the President of the Assembly at its sixty-first session, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">I take this opportunity to state the firm position of my Government that the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people, including those of Taiwan, which we consider to be an integral part of China. We further believe in the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of one China. We therefore strongly support the decision of the General Committee not to recommend the inclusion of item 165 of the draft agenda in the agenda of the sixty-second session. We fully support that decision.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Tareo</span> <span class="nation">Marshall Islands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">At the outset, I sincerely congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">I am speaking today in support of the request made by various Member States to have a supplementary item included in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly, relating to the question of the representation of Taiwan in the United Nations. The Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands reiterates its full support for the ongoing quest of the people of Taiwan to be permitted to participate in the United Nations. Under Article 4 of the Charter, membership of the Organization is open to all peace-loving States which accept the obligations of the Charter and are able and willing to carry out those obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">Taiwan is a peace-loving State committed to the protection and promotion of human rights. It is an active, constructive member of the international community. Taiwan is also ready and willing to accept and carry out the obligations of the United Nations Charter. Taiwan is a sovereign State in which 23 million people have democratically elected representatives to their Government. Only that Government can be the legitimate representative of the people of Taiwan in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa04">The principle of universality, as expressed in the United Nations Charter, is completely contradicted by the continued exclusion of a peace-loving, free and democratic State from this Organization. There is no justification for this ongoing exclusion. In today's world, where the maintenance of regional and international peace and security is becoming our most important priority, it is increasingly important to ensure that this body is a truly global institution, inclusive of all nations and that can come together to address the most pressing issues of our time. Therefore, I urge all Member States to support the inclusion of this item in our agenda for the upcoming General Assembly session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa05">This issue has been allowed to go unaddressed for too long. It is time to put political and strategic interests aside and to take positive action to ensure that the people of Taiwan can be represented in this global body.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adamou</span> <span class="nation">Niger</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">The Republic of the Niger firmly believes in one indivisible China: the People's Republic of China. Our position is in keeping with General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) and with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, in particular non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States. In the view of Niger, the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole representative of the Chinese people, including those of Taiwan, which is an integral part of the People's Republic of China. Accordingly, the delegation of Niger supports the recommendation of the General Committee not to include the question of Taiwan in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the Assembly.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khoc</span> <span class="nation">Sudan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the Sudanese delegation, I should like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We assure him of our continued support and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The Sudanese delegation supports the recommendation of the General Committee for the non-inclusion of item 165 of the draft in the agenda. My delegation supports the one-China policy as adopted by the General Assembly in 1971 through resolution 2758 (XXVI).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization that comprises only sovereign States, including China. On that basis, my delegation supports the non-inclusion of item 165 of the draft agenda.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dlamini</span> <span class="nation">Swaziland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">At the outset, the delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to unequivocally place it on the record that it objects to and protests the decision of the General Committee to recommend that this matter not be included as an agenda item of this session. Further, the delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland protests the entire manner in which the whole issue has been handled. In this regard, my delegation associates itself with what has already been said, particularly by the delegations of Palau, the Gambia and others.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">I would go into detail, but as the President has requested, for the sake of time, I will not repeat what has already been stated, apart from mentioning a couple of things.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">The delegation of Swaziland finds it very curious that in this Hall there are thinly veiled attacks against the States that are raising this matter, as if they have committed some unknown offence. Those Member States, of which the Kingdom of Swaziland is one, have every right, like those other Member States which oppose this matter, to their point of view. As a matter of fact, if we turn back the hands of time, three decades ago the delegation of Taiwan was sitting in this very Hall. When its membership was under threat, no such thinly veiled attacks were made; instead, the matter was debated on its merits. In any event, it is the sign of a weak argument when one leaves the substance of the argument and attacks the people who are making that argument.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa04">Further, we find it curious that there is concern about the appearance of this matter now and again. Naturally, the matter will appear again and again until it is dealt with properly, by being allowed to go through the normal processes.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa05">The actions of the Secretary-General do not in any way help this matter when the Secretary-General usurps the powers that are exclusively reserved for Member States. It is neither the place nor the time for the Secretary-General to decide that an application or correspondence directed to an organ of this institution is not receivable. With the greatest respect, that is a decision that is reserved for the Members.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa06">The people of Taiwan -- 23 million of them -- have suffered serious injustice within and beyond the precincts of the United Nations. The root cause of that injustice is resolution 2758 (XXVI). I want to conclude by mentioning a few problems with that resolution. As a matter of fact, contrary to what has been alleged today, that resolution was merely a decision of a simple majority; the record is available for anyone to inspect.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa07">The resolution is problematic in another way. On the one hand, it sought to be an application by the People's Republic of China to join the United Nations. But curiously, mischievously and simultaneously it also sought to expel -- and indeed it did expel -- a Member of the Organization, a founding Member at that. One has to ask, what of the formation of the United Nations itself? What of the resolutions that, according to resolution 2758 (XXVI), were adopted by a body that included a Member that was not supposed to be there?</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa08">To claim that resolution 2758 (XXVI) resolved the matter once and for all is just a pie-in-the-sky wish. The matter is before us, and it will continue to be so until it is fully resolved.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa09">I will conclude with one or two further points on resolution 2758 (XXVI). The resolution is couched in such ambiguous terms that it is very difficult for anyone to say that it is the final resolution of this body on the matter. Further, because of the manner in which it is couched, the resolution has been repadded, amplified, interpreted and reinterpreted to include things that were not originally in it.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa10">Under the circumstances, we align ourselves with the call for this matter to be referred back to the General Committee for reconsideration so that it can be dealt with properly and so that the matter can follow its proper course.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Giorgio</span> <span class="nation">Eritrea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I am taking the floor to briefly state Eritrea's position on the agenda item under discussion, namely Taiwan's representation at the United Nations. My delegation supports the statement made by the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China. In that regard, the State of Eritrea wishes to reiterate its position of maintaining the one-China policy, which is consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 2758 (XXVI), of 1971. That resolution, in its third preambular paragraph and in its operative paragraph, clearly states that the People's Republic of China is the only lawful and legitimate representative of China to the United Nations. Therefore, my delegation supports the recommendation made by the General Committee with respect to the non-inclusion of the item on Taiwan's representation at the United Nations in an agenda of the General Assembly.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hunte</span> <span class="nation">Antigua and Barbuda</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Antigua and Barbuda supports the adoption of the General Committee report (<a href="../pdf/A-61-250.pdf" class="pdf">A/61/250</a>) and the Committee's recommendation not to include item 165 of the draft agenda in the work of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. The recommendation of the General Committee conforms to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) and reflects the will of the majority of Member States. The United Nations should not be a place where separation of territory of its Member States is supported. The maintenance of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States are among the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Salahuddin Noman Chowdhury</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01">We support the General Committee's recommendation not to include item 165 of the draft agenda in the agenda of the General Assembly. Bangladesh is consistent in its position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of China. General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI), of 1971, has settled once and for all the issue of representation of China in the United Nations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Pierce</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa01">The United Kingdom supports the General Committee recommendation that item 165 of the draft agenda not be included in the agenda of the sixty-second session. The United Kingdom's position on Taiwan has not changed. We urge both the Chinese Government and the Taiwanese authorities to avoid any action that may increase tension across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa02">We are strongly opposed to the use of force to resolve this issue, and we would welcome renewed efforts by both sides to lower tensions, to engage in confidence-building measures and to find a mutually acceptable basis for the resumption of constructive dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa03">Finally, I would like to add that discussions today have been kept helpfully brief, enabling us to get through business quickly. That is very much a model that we applaud and that we hope it will be possible to apply to all debates in the Hall, and not just to this one.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Acting President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01"> I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for her support for the idea of brief statements. I think all of us need to work towards completing this matter expeditiously.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Renié</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">My statement will be especially brief. France too supports the recommendation of the General Committee that the question of the admission of Taiwan not be included in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. France does not favour including that item. We reiterate the consistent position we have expressed on the issue of Taiwan. We would once again emphasize the importance of peaceful dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mantovani</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa01">By its resolution 2758 (XXVI), the General Assembly recognized the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations. In accordance with that resolution, and in line with its adherence to the one-China policy, Italy reiterates its view that a satisfactory solution to the cross-Strait issue can be achieved only through a constructive dialogue between the parties. We are against any unilateral actions that could increase tensions and jeopardize the encouraging progress made recently through practical cooperation measures.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa02">Italy believes that the Secretary-General has correctly applied the provisions regarding membership applications, and that the General Assembly should refrain from taking initiatives that would diverge from the procedure foreseen in Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations. We therefore believe that the inclusion of the item under consideration in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly cannot be supported and that the relevant recommendation of the General Committee should be endorsed by the General Assembly.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Xhaferraj</span> <span class="nation">Albania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa01">On  behalf  of  my delegation, I would like once again to reiterate the position of my country on the one-China policy. The Republic of Albania supports the recommendation of the General Committee as reflected in paragraph 58 of <a href="../pdf/A-62-250.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/250</a>.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Ithete</span> <span class="nation">Namibia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa01">As this is the first time that my delegation has taken the floor since Mr. Kerim's assumption of the presidency of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him and to assure him of my delegation's full support and cooperation during his term of office.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa02">Namibia supports the General Committee's recommendation that the Taiwan issue not be included in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. The recommendation of the General Committee conforms to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States are among the cardinal principles enshrined in the Charter. The United Nations should not become a place where the separation of the territory of its Member States may be supported. The Taiwan question is an internal affair of China, and it should therefore only be resolved by the Chinese people themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk05-pa03">It is the strong position of my delegation that resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted in 1971, resolved once and for all China's representation in the United Nations -- politically, legally and in terms of procedure. Taiwan is an integral part of China's territory. The representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the legitimate representatives of China at the United Nations. That reality has never changed in any way.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk06-pa01">Ecuador associates itself with the comments made by the representative of the People's Republic of China. We reaffirm our position of respect for the Charter principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. In that connection, we fully support the recommendation of the General Committee not to include the issue of Taiwan in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. We hope that this delicate issue can be resolved by the people of China.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Borg</span> <span class="nation">Malta</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk07-pa01">I would like to join previous speakers in expressing to Mr. Kerim my delegation's congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk07-pa02">The delegation of Malta has on previous occasions made the point that resolution 2758 (XXVI), which was adopted in 1971, deals adequately and comprehensively with the subject. Our view remains that the one-China policy provides the best basis for a peaceful solution to the question of Taiwan. In the light of those considerations, the delegation of Malta will support the decision taken by the General Committee not to recommend the inclusion of proposed item 165 in the agenda of the sixty-second session.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The delegation of Lebanon would like to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We assure him of our full support and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The delegation of Lebanon believes that the question of the representation of China was settled by resolution 2758 (XXVI), of 1971. The one-China principle is clear, and the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people. The issue of Taiwan is an internal Chinese matter that can only be resolved internally. The delegation of Lebanon supports the recommendation of the General Committee not to include item 165 of the draft agenda, concerning Taiwan's membership application in the agenda of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">My country's position on the matter of the representation of Taiwan at the United Nations is clear. The General Assembly resolved this issue once and for all when it adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI), in 1971. The Republic of Madagascar recognizes only one China, namely, the People's Republic of China, of which Taiwan is an integral part. Madagascar respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China and opposes any interference in the internal affairs of Member States.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa01">Upon instructions from my Government, I wish to reiterate its official position on the issue under consideration today. By resolution 2758 (XXVI), of 25 October 1971, the General Assembly restored the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China and settled the issue of the representation of the Chinese people and Government in the United Nations. Therefore, the inclusion of the proposed item in the agenda of the General Assembly would contradict the principled decision taken by the General Assembly back in 1971.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa02">At previous sessions, the General Committee refused to include this item in the Assembly's agenda. Like many others, we believe that there is no compelling reason for this issue to be included in the agenda of the current session. My delegation therefore supports the General Committee's recommendation not to include agenda item 165 in the agenda of the General Assembly.</p>

Accordingly, we support the decision of the General Committee not to recommend the inclusion of the item in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa02">My delegation supports the recommendation of the General Committee contained in paragraph 58 of its first report (<a href="../pdf/A-62-250.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/250</a>), namely, not to include item 165 in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. My delegation would like to reaffirm that the issue of Taiwan is a matter that was resolved several decades ago, namely, by resolution 2758 (XXVI). That resolution, adopted in 1971, affirmed that the Government of the People's Republic of China was the sole representative of China.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa03">We continue to believe in one China. We also believe that Taiwan is an integral part of the People's Republic of China. Any efforts to encourage Taiwan's separation from the mother country constitute interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, as well as a violation of its territorial integrity and of the Charter of the United Nations. We support the policy of the People's Republic of China to peacefully reunite Taiwan with the mother country.</p>

Resolution 2758 (XXVI), which was adopted in 1971, once and for all decided the issue of the representation of the Chinese people in the United Nations. There is only one China, and in the current state of affairs it includes Taiwan as an integral part. That is why my delegation opposes the request to include an item in the agenda of the sixty-second session regarding the request made to the Security Council to address Taiwan's application for membership.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">My Government's position, which is a permanent element of my country's foreign policy, is based on the one-China principle and respect for the territorial integrity of Member States. I should like to reaffirm that point in order to underscore Benin's commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and the cardinal principles enshrined therein.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">In conclusion, my delegation would like to reiterate its full support for the General Committee. We request that its recommendation be adopted without further delay.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk05-pa02">The sponsors, in their zeal to press this agenda item, have not held back from denouncing the Secretary-General, the Secretariat, the General Committee, the resolutions of the General Assembly, and also the one country whose territorial integrity they are challenging. We have heard various specious legal and political arguments to defend their proposal.</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline-tookchair" id="pg008-bk06">
	<p id="pg008-bk06-pa01">The President took the Chair.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk07">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa01">First, as to the Charter and the rules, under Article 4 of the Charter, only a State -- a sovereign State -- is entitled to apply for membership of the United Nations. Taiwan is not a State and has never been a State. In the preparations for the United Nations creation in the Cairo Declaration of 1943 and in the Potsdam Declaration of 1945, China was accepted as one country. Since 1949, when the defeated nationalists retreated to Taiwan and were illegally allowed to occupy China's seat here at the United Nations until 1971, they have claimed to represent one China. There was never any question of the separation of China.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa02">Indeed, in 1971, in resolution 2758 (XXVI), it was clearly and categorically decided, first, to restore the rights of the People's Republic of China; secondly, to expel the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek; and thirdly, to reject any concept of two Chinas or one China, one Taiwan. I do not know whether any of the sponsors of this proposal were here at the United Nations at that time. I happened to be there, and my delegation was a sponsor of resolution 2758 (XXVI). The records show that proposals for two Chinas -- proposals for one China and one Taiwan -- were categorically rejected by the General Assembly during those debates. Therefore, the unity and territorial integrity of China cannot be questioned and the issue cannot be reopened.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa03">Taiwan is a part of a sovereign Member State of the United Nations. As such, it cannot apply for United Nations membership. It cannot apply, just as no part of any other sovereign country can apply for membership in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa04">Moreover, the Charter states quite clearly in article 4 that the judgment regarding membership for a State must be exercised by the Organization. This Organization has, in resolution 2758 (XXVI), exercised that judgment, the judgment that Taiwan is not a State and therefore not eligible to apply for membership. Accordingly, the Secretary-General and the Secretariat were absolutely right in declaring that the so-called application of the Taiwan authorities was unreceivable. It was a matter already decided by Member States. The Secretary-General and the Secretariat are bound to implement the decisions of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa05">Third, no third party has the right to intervene and prescribe a measure that contravenes international law, history, culture, tradition and the long-established wishes of the Chinese people themselves. We respect the rights of all the Members of the General Assembly, but those very same States must respect the rights of others. If this were not the case, if we were to resort to the admission of proposals that violate the Charter and call each other's territorial integrity into question, the United Nations would become a centre of discord and disharmony rather than a centre for the harmonization of the policies of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa06">It is a measure of the tolerance and indeed of the self-confidence of the People's Republic of China that this charade has been allowed to take place here year after year, despite the categorical position of the General Assembly. This tolerance and accommodation is indeed evident in the policies of the Government of the People's Republic of China towards its province of Taiwan. The endeavour for the peaceful reunification of China is constant and under way, under the banner of one country, two systems. The conclusion of such a peaceful reunification is something that must be upheld by the General Assembly. It is only held back by some separatist politicians and those who encourage them from outside. We should, in this Assembly today, decide that if such a move is made again, the Assembly will denounce it and will, as the Secretary-General did, decide that any such proposal made in the future will be illegitimate and therefore unreceivable.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ferreira</span> <span class="nation">Sao Tome and Principe</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I have the privilege to take the floor on behalf of the delegation of Sao Tome and Principe. My delegation strongly rejects the recommendations of the General Committee. We noted with attention and deep concern the answer given to the letter of the President of Taiwan by the legal adviser of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The request made by a group of countries to include the item in our agenda is not, as some countries are describing it, an intervention in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. The Republic of China on Taiwan has the same rights and fulfils all the requirements to be among us. Taiwan's people are in the streets, calling for the world to listen to them, the voice of reason. Thousands demonstrated and sent a clear message to the United Nations. The people of Taiwan must have representation in the United Nations. We United Nations Member States must pay close attention to these events, because international security could be jeopardized in the subregion. We will all pay if we do not take the right decision in the Security Council and the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Allow me to call on the General Assembly to pay special attention to that matter and not to take a cosmetic decision under resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted by the Assembly on 25 October 1971, alone, because that resolution is not clear. It was not adopted by a two-thirds majority and is in violation of Chapter IV, Article 18 of the Charter, paragraph 2 of  which states, "Decisions of the General Assembly on important questions shall be made by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting." I hope the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations will prevail.</p>

My delegation is of the opinion that decisions of the General Committee taken within its area of competence should generally be respected.

The 23 million people of Taiwan have again been denied their fundamental human rights because of their lack of representation and participation in this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The majority of Member States in this Assembly are here today because they applied for membership. Their membership was reviewed and ultimately approved. It was only at that point that those countries felt that they could participate effectively in the affairs of the international community and, most importantly, benefit from the various United Nations initiatives. The people of Taiwan deserve that right as well. When we try to ignore this, we do a grave disservice to the people of Taiwan and we do a grave disservice to us all. Therefore, I reiterate my delegation's position that this Assembly should seriously consider the rights of the people of Taiwan and include Taiwan's application for membership in the agenda of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">El Salvador firmly supports the proposal to include in the agenda of the General Assembly an item on Taiwan's becoming a Member of the United Nations, as we believe that resolution 2758 (XXVI), of 1971, did not put an end to this debate.

	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa02">Considering the issue of Taiwan has become an annual ritual. If the General Assembly were a debating club, we would sit happily and enjoy this annual circus. As my colleague the Permanent Representative of Pakistan has said, the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations are very clear as to who is entitled to apply to be a member of this House. In fact, if this were a court of law, on just a preliminary point, this matter would have been immediately dismissed with costs, without wasting the time of this body for an entire day debating an issue that is so clear. One begins to wonder about the motives of those preparing or peddling this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa03">At stake is not the issue of the size of a population; it is not an issue of whether a particular area is democratic or not; it is not an issue of whether a particular area is economically powerful, and therefore should apply for membership. Those are irrelevant considerations. What is at issue is whether the qualifications to apply for membership have been met. The answer in this case is definitely no.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa04">The question of the membership of Taiwan in the Organization was settled as far back as 1971 in the famous resolution 2758 (XXVI). But, despite that fact, this issue has been brought up here every year. At stake is an attempt to dismember a Member State, and this House cannot be a party to dismembering a Member State. Therefore, Uganda strongly opposes any attempt to drag this matter into this House.</p>
