	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">At this meeting, the Council will hear a briefing by His Excellency Mr. Frank Majoor, Permanent Representative of the Netherlands and Chairman of the Sierra Leone country-specific configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission. I now give the floor to Ambassador Majoor.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Majoor</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I very much welcome this opportunity to participate in the Council's meeting on Sierra Leone in my capacity as Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission's country-specific meetings on Sierra Leone. My last statement in that capacity before the Security Council dates back to 17 October, when I participated in the Council's debate on the Peacebuilding Commission (see <a href="../html/S-PV-5761.html">S/PV.5761</a>). On that occasion, I briefed the Council on my recent visit to Sierra Leone and the discussions with the newly elected Government of Sierra Leone on the draft peacebuilding cooperation framework.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Today I would like to brief the Council on a key development since then. On 12 December -- only two days ago -- at a formal Peacebuilding Commission meeting attended by Her Excellency Zainab Bangura, Foreign Minister of Sierra Leone, the Peacebuilding Commission and the Government of Sierra Leone adopted the Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework. The Framework will guide the work of the Commission and the Government of Sierra Leone over the next three years and will address the challenges and threats most critical to sustaining and consolidating peace in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework was developed through an intensive consultative process over the last several months involving all major stakeholders both here in New York and in Freetown. It contains commitments on the part of the Government of Sierra Leone and the Peacebuilding Commission in the areas of good governance, security and justice sector reform, youth employment and empowerment, energy sector development and capacity-building. In addition, it addresses subregional dimensions of peacebuilding and the cross-cutting issue of gender equality. The Commission will use the Framework to enhance dialogue and strengthen partnerships between Sierra Leone and its international partners and to mobilize additional resources needed for peace consolidation efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The development of this Cooperation Framework and its adoption represent another major milestone in Sierra Leone's journey from conflict to peace, stability and prosperity. Despite the significant progress in peace consolidation in Sierra Leone, many of the root causes of conflict still need to be addressed. Additional efforts are also needed to reconcile the country, reform governance institutions and address the dire socio-economic conditions of the people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The primary responsibility to address these challenges rests with the people and the Government of Sierra Leone. At the same time, it is equally important to acknowledge that the international community, including the United Nations, should remain engaged in the country and continue to support national efforts for peacebuilding and recovery. The Peacebuilding Commission was created specifically to ensure sustained engagement and support by the international community for countries recovering from conflict. The Framework adopted the day before yesterday will ensure Sierra Leone's cooperation with the Peacebuilding Commission and the commitment of all stakeholders in the Commission, on the basis of national ownership, mutual accountability and sustained engagement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">By encouraging implementation of the commitments contained in the Framework, the Peacebuilding Commission can play, and will play, a critical role in support of the new Government and in meeting the high expectations of the people of Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">In this regard, I would welcome continued support from the Security Council in ensuring constructive engagement of all stakeholders in the work of the Peacebuilding Commission. I also use this opportunity to call on all stakeholders to live up to the commitments made through the Cooperation Framework by considering and offering additional and concrete support to address the identified priorities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">With the Framework in hand, we now have the opportunity to provide focused support to a country that has emerged from conflict but that is still struggling to address those factors that could trigger a relapse into conflict, in spite of the good progress that has been made in many areas. In other words, we now have the opportunity to do what the Peacebuilding Commission was created for.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Finally, I would like to request that, in extending the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone, the Security Council mandate the Office to continue to support the work of the Peacebuilding Commission and the implementation of the newly adopted Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework.</p>
