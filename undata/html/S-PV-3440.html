	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Council will now proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the General Assembly, the draft of which has been prepared by the Secretariat. I wish to note that, in accordance with the decisions taken in June 1994, this is the second instance in which the Council's report is considered in a public meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">I now call on the Director of the Security Council Affairs Division of the Secretariat to make an explanatory statement.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Bali</span> <span class="non-nation">Director of the Security Council Affairs Division</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">The draft annual report of the Security Council for the period from 16 June 1993 to 15 June 1994, to be submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations in pursuance of paragraph 3 of Article 24 and paragraph 1 of Article 15 of the United Nations Charter, has been prepared by the Secretariat in line with the revised format agreed upon by the Security Council in 1974 and further revised in 1985, 1993 and 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">As requested by the Security Council, the current draft report contains a more detailed introduction. The draft report also contains two new appendices, namely, appendix VII, listing communications from the President of the Security Council or the Secretary-General, and appendix VIII, which lists the reports of the Secretary-General issued during the period covered by the report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">The draft report was circulated on 28 September 1994 to the current members of the Security Council and also to the respective members whose terms of office expired on 31 December 1993 - that is, Cape Verde, Hungary, Japan, Morocco and Venezuela - for their comments, if any. The corrigendum reflects comments received.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">I should like to express appreciation to the Secretariat for the work it has undertaken in preparing this factual report, which corresponds to the agreement by the members of the Council on the timely submission and format of the report, as reflected in the note by the President of the Security Council of 30 June 1993, <a href="../pdf/S-26015.pdf" class="nolink">document S/26015</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the draft annual report of the Security Council to the General Assembly for the period 16 June 1993 to 15 June 1994, as circulated by the Assistant Secretary-General of the Department of Political Affairs on 28 September 1994, and corrigendum. May I take it that the draft report is adopted by the Council?</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">This decision will be reflected in a note by the President of the Security Council, to be issued as <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1176.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1176</a>.</p>
