	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">Before turning to the item on our agenda, I would like, on behalf of all delegations, to express the great sorrow we felt on learning of the tragic event involving Ambassador Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, who was the victim of a car accident in Mexico. We all remember the contribution that Adolfo Aguilar Zinser made to the work of the Council as Permanent Representative of Mexico to the United Nations from February 2002 to November 2003. He vigorously defended his country's positions while also being a committed champion of modern multilateralism. In him we had an excellent colleague known for his reliability, constructive approach and openness. In short, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser was a talented diplomat. We shall long miss him.</p>
