	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">Before calling on Mr. Adeniji, let me apologize for starting this meeting late. I was making a statement on behalf of the Council at the fourth Summit on the Security of International Staff. I thought it was important that the Council's point of view be heard -- particularly in view of the fact that the first exchange between the Council and staff members took place last month at a meeting under the Arria formula -- and for the President of the Council to be there, along with the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">At this meeting the Council will hear a briefing by Mr. Oluyemi Adeniji, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone. I give him the floor.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adeniji</span> <span class="non-nation">Special Representative of the Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">It is a great pleasure to be appearing before the Security Council today. The Council has been meeting under your able direction, Mr. President, during a month of momentous activity. My appearance, of course, is in connection with the presentation of the tenth report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), <a href="../pdf/S-2001-627.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/627</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Since my last opportunity to brief the Council on UNAMSIL, on 14 February 2001, the Sierra Leone peace process has witnessed changes that are remarkable both in magnitude and in pattern of development. A detailed account is contained in the Secretary-General's report. I shall recall what I said on the last occasion I addressed the Council in relation to the Ceasefire Agreement signed at Abuja on 10 November 2000 between the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). I said on that occasion that the Agreement encompassed not only undertakings relating to the cessation of hostilities, but also other important elements, such as disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, which obviously required more time than the 30 days stipulated for the review of the Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Happily, in view of the fact that they were enjoying the benefits of the cessation of hostilities, which continued to hold, neither the Government of Sierra Leone nor the RUF was anxious to resume generalized armed conflict, notwithstanding the fact that several other provisions of the Abuja Agreement had not been implemented by the end of the 30 days.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Throughout this lull, UNAMSIL continued to work closely with the Government of Sierra Leone. It also intensified its contacts at several levels with the RUF, aimed at building mutual confidence, exploring ways to ensure progress on the provisions of the Abuja Agreement, and making a realistic assessment of the intentions of the RUF. That period also enabled UNAMSIL to build up the strength of its troops from the low level it hit after the withdrawal of two contingents.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The combination of those activities and consultations carried out by UNAMSIL, which included the delicate consultations on Kambia, resulted in such positive trends and signals that I considered it appropriate to commence the process which ultimately led to the holding of the review meeting on 2 May 2001 at Abuja, which we now refer to as "Abuja II".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">In line with the decisions taken at that meeting, UNAMSIL, the Government of Sierra Leone and the RUF met again, in Freetown, on 15 May 2001 to discuss the details of the practical implementation of the resumption of the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. Modalities for the commencement of the simultaneous disarmament of the RUF and the Civil Defence Force (CDF) in the Kambia and Port Loko districts were agreed upon. The operation was to commence on 18 May and was to last 10 days, and it was to be followed immediately by the deployment of the new Sierra Leone army in Kambia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">Permit me to dwell a little on the significance of the agreement concerning Kambia and its successful implementation. Kambia was deliberately chosen in order to tackle several problems at the same time -- to kill several birds with one stone. First, on disarmament, it was to be the first positive proof that the RUF genuinely meant their commitment to that programme; they had assured us and UNAMSIL all along that they were deeply committed to it. The turnout and disarmament of RUF combatants in the Kambia district on 18 May -- beginning with the brigade commander himself, whom I personally disarmed -- was indeed an impressive show of commitment. The CDF -- the other militia group, which is allied to the Government of Sierra Leone -- whose turnout at the beginning on 18 May was rather lacklustre and was a disappointment to us -- obviously felt challenged when they heard, from their own leaders whom I had taken with me to witness the disarmament of the RUF, how the RUF had turned out and how they had disarmed and carried out the exercise. Thereafter, they took the programme seriously.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">Secondly, the deployment of the Sierra Leone army in Kambia after the evacuation by UNAMSIL of the disarmed RUF forces was to stop RUF incursions into Guinea, which had provoked massive retaliatory attacks by Guinea. The uneventful deployment of the Sierra Leone army justified my insistence that it could be done without what, in retrospect, could have been a very, very bloody battle with unpredictable results. That had been the plan: to send the newly trained Sierra Leone army against the RUF. I opposed that, because I thought that the new Sierra Leone army was very much untried and untested and that it would be a very sad mistake to expose them in that way. We then found, when we went to Kambia to disarm the RUF, that in fact the numbers of RUF combatants in that district had been so grossly underestimated that, sadly, there would have been disastrous consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Thirdly, the presence of an arm of Government such as the army in the Kambia district, for the first time since the RUF occupied that area about four years ago, was to represent a major step in the extension of the Government's authority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">Fourthly, these three earlier reasons for going into Kambia were intended to address a subregional dimension of the Sierra Leone conflict. In accordance with the plan, the removal of the RUF and deployment of the Sierra Leone army ensured the security of the Sierra Leone-Guinea border in that area. It thus removed one of the flashpoints in the Mano River Union conflict. It also created a secure corridor for a possible overland return of Sierra Leonean refugees from Guinea, whose plight, of course, had been of serious concern to the international community, with various plans being proposed, none of which, unfortunately, ever worked.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">Fifthly, and lastly -- and this was one of the consequences that neither I nor any of my colleagues in UNAMSIL had foreseen -- the success of the Kambia operation precipitated the unexpected urge of Sierra Leoneans in the other border area of Sierra Leone with Guinea -- that is, in the Kono district -- to wish to return immediately to their own districts. This has since occasioned the leapfrogging of the disarmament programme into the Kono district. It has thrown out of gear the plan that the secretariat of the National Commission on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration had made.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">The decision of the joint tripartite committee of the Government of Sierra Leone, the RUF and UNAMSIL, at its meeting of 2 June, to commence disarmament in the Kono district, and to associate with Kono the Bonthe district for the CDF, had to be in response to that development, which as I said, was unforeseen. The delay in the implementation is clear evidence that the disarmament programme has become, one could say, a victim of its own successful relaunching. With disarmament in Kono not envisaged until towards the end of the whole programme, no facility for the programme exists in Kono, or even near Kono. It is now being constructed and should be ready in a couple of days, on 30 June. Thus, I envisage the formal commencement of the disarmament programme in Kono, as well as in Bonthe, on 1 July.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">Meanwhile, in the course of this month of June, we have continued the final phase of disarmament in the Port Loko district, which, again, had to be delayed, because no camp was available in which to keep the combatants. As of yesterday, the total figure of disarmed combatants since the relaunching of the programme on 18 May stands at 6,342, which consists of 2,004 RUF, 4,210 CDF and 128 remnants of the Sierra Leonean army and the Armed Forces Ruling Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">Considerable progress has also been made in other aspects of the peace process, which thus strengthens the general perception in Sierra Leone that peace is at last in sight. Most of the roads in the country have been reopened and are free of security-related roadblocks, hitherto erected by the RUF and the CDF. This has considerably improved humanitarian access and the resumption of humanitarian operations by agencies and organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">On 26 June, a multidisciplinary team, led by UNAMSIL, and composed of representatives of United Nations agencies and the Sierra Leone National Commission for Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, conducted an assessment of the humanitarian needs in the Kono and Kailahun districts, even in advance of the disarmament programme in those areas. This is indicative of the forward planning that the general improvement within the country has made possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">The release of child combatants and other abducted children, including females, has also continued. The number of released today stands at 1,215. Of these, 1,062 were released by the RUF and 153 by the CDF.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">The expansion of Government authority throughout the country is being actively pursued, with the advice and support of UNAMSIL. The Mission has also continued to promote confidence-building measures in order to encourage Government functionaries, including ministers, to go to areas which, up until the present time, have been under the domination of the RUF, and vice versa. This has considerably reduced mutual suspicion and virtually stopped the RUF's questioning of the authority of the Government. For its part, the Government has begun to make concrete gestures, such as the process that will lead to the recruitment of some RUF combatants into the Sierra Leone army.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">Of course, more will need to be done in recognition and encouragement of the present RUF leadership's demonstrated commitment to the peace process. In this connection, the Government of Sierra Leone will meet to devise ways of absorbing qualified elements of the RUF into other arms of Government besides the army. It will also need to start the release of the RUF elements other than the co-leadership, of course, who have been in detention since May 2000. In addition, the Government will have to take further measures to encourage the transformation of the RUF into a political party, fully committed to making whatever contribution it can within the political setting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">For its part, the international community will need to step up its support for the rapidly evolving peace process. The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme, as emphasized in the tenth report of the Secretary-General, will run out of funds in August unless the $31 million in additional funding, which is required, starts coming into the World Bank's multi-donor trust fund. The donors' conference on the programme, which was convened in Paris on 11 and 12 June 2001, was encouraging in the unanimous applauding of the important strides that have been made. However, this, unfortunately, did not immediately result in definite financial pledges.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">It cannot be overemphasized that the greatest danger that could disrupt the progress currently being made is a mishandling of the DDR programme. Funds have to be available to provide the facilities for the programme; funds have to be available to take care of incentives for the combatants; and funds have to be available to assure provision of reintegration packages. In that context, therefore, the Security Council may wish to back up the efforts of the Secretary-General to encourage donors to take urgent follow-up steps to the Paris conference and for them to convey firm pledges to the Sierra Leone DDR trust fund, which is being managed by the World Bank. If the response is not quick enough, the Council, in my view, may be called upon for an alternative source of funding.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">UNAMSIL's increased role in the programme has placed it at centre court, to use a tennis expression during this week of Wimbledon. It would be totally incomprehensible if the international community were not able to provide the relatively modest amount that is required for this programme when that amount is compared with what is being spent on peacekeeping. The Sierra Leonean people would just not understand.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa22">So far, UNAMSIL has maintained a decision which it arrived at jointly with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Government of Sierra Leone as far back as November -- when the first meeting was held, to agree on the Abuja Ceasefire Agreement -- not to discuss political issues with the RUF. Since then, at the subsequent meetings, we have held to that position. The position was to ensure progress in the decisions of the first and second Abuja meetings.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa23">Given the present progress, it will become difficult to maintain that position. Indeed, as I was told by the Chairman of ECOWAS, President Konaré of Mali, and President Obasanjo of Nigeria, at their bilateral consultation in Abuja on 18 June, that both ECOWAS and UNAMSIL must henceforth be prepared to focus on political issues which, from the information that the two Presidents said was available to them, the RUF would begin to raise at subsequent meetings. The issues that would arise suddenly would concern the governance of the country after the expiration of the six-month extension of the Government on 30 September this year, the extent of the transition period before elections and the date of the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa24">In the political vision announced by the Government of Sierra Leone, elections are to be held in December 2001 in accordance with the strategic plan of the National Electoral Commission. There are many doubts as to the feasibility of that date. Besides, the Government's vision is silent on the issue of the period after September and before the elections. These and other related issues -- such as the nature of the electoral system to be adopted, assurance that a large segment of Sierra Leoneans, notably refugees and displaced persons, are not to be disenfranchised, linkage between the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme and elections -- will all draw attention in the coming period. I hope that consultations will be held between us and ECOWAS and the Government of Sierra Leone, as has been the case.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa25">In conclusion, at a time when there is a general feeling of the dawn of peace in Sierra Leone, it is heartening to note the commencement of the demonstration of this period of reconciliation and national healing. The experiment of lodging together disarmed RUF and CDF combatants in the same DDR facility was spontaneously repeated by the two groups in Kono, when, in what they termed a gesture of the feeling that the war is over, according to them, these two opposing groups received each other in their reciprocal camps in visits which they called overnight visits of brotherhood.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa26">The Government of Sierra Leone, and the President personally, are in the forefront of promoting this process of reconciliation. UNAMSIL, as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General, has been playing a leading role also. With the continuing consensus by all sections of Sierra Leonean society, including the RUF, as to the value of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, we in UNAMSIL have been making intensified efforts for the establishment of that Commission. The High Commissioner for Human Rights and I, as selection coordinators, have advanced in the process of identifying the commissioners. I do hope that the relatively modest amount that will be required for the operation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will be quickly donated so that the Commission can commence operations as fast as possible. It is certainly desirable, as many Sierra Leoneans have expressed, that priority of operation should be given to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This priority is the desire of many Sierra Leoneans.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa27">Finally, may I express my appreciation for the continued support which members of this Council have always given to UNAMSIL, even in the darkest days, as it were, of the Mission. I think that the unflinching support of the Council gave a lot of courage not only to UNAMSIL but also to the people of Sierra Leone to persist in the efforts which have led us to where we are now.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa28">May I also express particular appreciation to the countries that have contributed troops on the ground. Despite the problem of their small numbers -- which we still have, because the expansion that the Council accorded to UNAMSIL recently has really not been translated physically on the ground, and we are still awaiting the Pakistani battalions -- the troops on the ground, under the very capable and inspired leadership of the Force Commander, Lieutenant-General Daniel Opande, whom I have the pleasure of having with me here for this briefing session, have been willing to exert themselves, perhaps sometimes beyond the call of duty. This is what has enabled us to handle the Kono incident in the way that it was handled, because we really do not have a deployment as such in Kono. It was not part of our deployment plan at this time, because of the lack of troops. This is the area we have reserved for the additional troops that were coming. But with some degree of foresight on our part, and with a lot of push by the Force Commander, a device had been worked out whereby we have a permanent rotating presence in Kono assured by part of the Bangladeshi contingent. I must say here that that presence -- the presence of those two companies -- made all the difference in the manner in which Kono, which everyone had thought was taboo and a no-go area, had been handled.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Adeniji for his comprehensive and very useful briefing. I believe it has given us along with the report of the Secretary-General, some very important aspects and points which need to be addressed by the members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">As I now proceed to give the floor to the members of the Council, my appeal and request to them would be that they be focused in their statement, rather than elaborating a long speech on their policy towards Sierra Leone, and address the points that the report of the Secretary-General and Mr. Adeniji have raised. I think that it will serve the purpose of the debate better if we do so. At some given points, I shall come back to Mr. Adeniji for a response to the points raised by the members of the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">I hear your call, Mr. President.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">We very much thank the Special Representative and the Force Commander for being with us today. It is very good to see them and I fully agree that we had a very informative and useful briefing from the Special Representative.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">We welcome the Secretary-General's comprehensive report. It comes at a critical juncture in the peace process and shows the significant achievements of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL): its steady and ongoing deployment; the effective implementation of the Abuja Ceasefire Agreement; securing the real commitment of the Revolutionary United Front and the Civil Defence Force to demobilization, disarmament and reintegration; the release of child combatants and detainees; and the gradual improvement, though still too slow, of the humanitarian situation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">The United Kingdom continues to support UNAMSIL and the Government of Sierra Leone very actively. We, too, were encouraged by recent developments and recognize this as a real opportunity to achieve lasting peace. The coordination which was so urgently called for by the Security Council mission last October has markedly improved, not least with the appointment of the Deputy Special Representative.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">We need, however, to maintain this momentum and the report correctly identifies some of the risks and challenges ahead. Sierra Leone has to negotiate a safe course through the handover of control of the diamond fields and the preparation of elections. The re-establishment of stable state institutions has to be part of this, not least the steady reconstruction of a well-trained army subject to proper civilian authority.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">The Special Representative is right that the priority in the short-term has to be to ensure the success of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. We support the Secretary-General's call for urgent new resources for the World Bank trust fund and reintegration projects. The United Kingdom has committed  15 million to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process over the last two years and is now funding a community reintegration programme in Port Loko. This has been a major commitment by one donor and, with the Secretary-General, we believe that it is time that this burden was shared more widely. The success of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme and, by extension, of the peace process more widely depends on more donors coming forward. Ambassador Adeniji has focused on this point.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">I should say that we particularly look to and are particularly grateful for the interest shown by our European Union colleagues, whose recent mission to West Africa shows the importance which the Union attaches to the region and to building up the relationship with the Economic Community of West African States. We warmly welcome the presence here today of Secretary of State Dahlgren.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">We share the Secretary-General's concern for more effective coordination between all the agencies involved in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. The National Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration is now developing a coherent plan for the roll-out across Sierra Leone and the preparation of adequate facilities. It is important that disarmament, demobilization and reintegration does not get ahead of this programme. We have to take account of the challenge of extending the government services. The three R's, including reconstruction in the economic area and the reintegration of internally displaced persons and refugees, are still a huge task involving neighbouring States.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">As the Secretary-General identifies, however, there must also be a greater sustained effort at providing real integration and reinsertion opportunities for ex-combatants if disarmament, demobilization and reintegration are to succeed in the long term. There are still serious gaps at present and the military reintegration programme is still available only to a small minority.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">The restoration of government control over the diamond fields and the orderly mining of diamonds, to the benefit of all Sierra Leoneans, are among the international community's main objectives. This is a major challenge. Our Department for International Development is commissioning a study at present to help the Government draw up plans for the equitable management of the diamond fields as UNAMSIL deploys eastward and government control extends over these areas. The Government is already benefiting from the introduction of the certification scheme for diamond exports. The value of legal exports has increased from $1.5 million in the year up to October 2000 to $17.3 million since October 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">Free and fair elections are going to be an important part of the processes of reconciliation and the normalization of politics. We welcome the Government's intention to hold elections as soon as conditions permit. We support UNAMSIL's intention to increase its focus on elections, specifically the creation of a small electoral unit, in the light of the challenges and preconditions identified by the Secretary-General. UNAMSIL should ensure that it coordinates its electoral activities with those of other agencies. We would need to consider very carefully any request for a significant uplift in UNAMSIL's resources to cover electoral responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">We want to see the early establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court. We welcome the report's call for the Commission to be operational as soon as possible, but both are equally important elements of the conflict resolution process in Sierra Leone. A delay to one should not hold up the establishment of the other. We look to donors to provide financial support to both institutions and hope that the Office of Legal Affairs and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will work with the Government to dispel the potentially destabilizing confusion within Sierra Leone and among combatants about the respective roles of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court and how the two processes will interrelate.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa13">If we compare what we were facing a year ago with the situation we are looking at now, I think we have to be encouraged. We set ourselves the task of turning around the desperate state of one of Africa's poorest and most troubled States and we have made progress. UNAMSIL, with its international support, is the reason for this, even after all the ups and downs. We pay tribute to the whole team on the ground, including troop contributors, agencies and humanitarian groups involved, for their courage, determination and increasingly effective work.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kolby</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I, too, would like to thank Ambassador Adeniji for his briefing. We welcome this opportunity to exchange views on the situation in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Norway would like to reiterate its strong support for the peace process and we note with satisfaction recent positive developments. The deployment of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to new areas, the release of a significant number of child combatants and the disarmament of several thousand ex-combatants represent significant progress for the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The process of disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation merits particular attention. Norway is pleased to see the progress of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process and the revitalization of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. The agreement to construct new camps for demobilization and the creation of a mobile disarmament unit will facilitate the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process further. We welcome the idea of integrating the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the Civil Defence Force (CDF) into the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration monitoring mechanism and technical bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">There are, however, significant challenges remaining. The reintegration of ex-combatants, returnees and internally displaced persons in the region that has been declared safe requires concrete and comprehensive measures. Close cooperation between the Government of Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL and other United Nations bodies is required. Particular attention should be given to the situation of child ex-combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">For the long-term stability of the country, it is crucial that income-generating activities are created and that ex-combatants and returning populations are given the possibility to participate in the revitalization of the country's economy. The extension of civilian authority is another precondition for the success of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process. Incentives for disarmament must be created by providing citizens with a basic sense of security. We therefore strongly encourage UNAMSIL to continue to work with the Sierra Leonean Government on efforts to extend civil authority, both qualitatively and geographically.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Norway has stated its willingness to provide additional personnel to the civilian police component of UNAMSIL, and we are preparing to have another Norwegian police officer, a superintendent, in place in Sierra Leone shortly.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">The Secretary-General has underlined the risk that the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme will soon stall as a result of insufficient funding. As a response to this situation, Norway is prepared to contribute another $500,000 to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration fund in addition to the $1 million we contributed in 1999. We will, however, need to see a firm commitment from other donors too, and we appeal both to the members of the Council and to others to contribute to the fund.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Norway has thus far contributed $8 million to humanitarian efforts in Sierra Leone and Guinea in 2001, and we have pledged $500,000 for the establishment of a special court for Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">The gradual improvement of the security situation in Sierra Leone has given the humanitarian agencies access to formerly inaccessible regions. The return of refugees has placed a heavy burden on the resources and the infrastructure in the Government-controlled areas. There is a clear need for the resettlement of both internally displaced persons and returnees to other regions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">Norway supports the efforts of the humanitarian agencies in their resettlement and reintegration activities. It is important that local governments, in close cooperation with peacekeeping forces, provide the necessary protection and security for the returning populations in the areas that have been declared secure.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">It is also essential that the Government be able to provide for a minimum of public services in former RUF-controlled areas. Improvements in the human rights situation in Sierra Leone are necessary. The situation for many internally displaced persons is particularly difficult, and reports of violations of international humanitarian law against the civilian population underline the need for swift and efficient UNAMSIL deployment and the establishment of civilian authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, we would like to express our appreciation for the efforts made by the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Governments in the region, the various humanitarian non-governmental organizations working in the country, and in particular those countries contributing troops and financial means.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa13">We congratulate the United Nations, ECOWAS and all parties involved in the conflict on the progress that has been made, and we urge them to maintain the momentum created in the peace process over the past two months.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa14">I have four questions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa15">We see from paragraph 27 of the report that the total number of disarmed ex-combatants stands at 5,669, and that those combatants have handed in 2,991 weapons. It seems to me that the number of weapons is low compared to the number of disarmed combatants. Could Ambassador Adeniji comment on this and elaborate a little bit on the types and quality of the collected weapons?</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa16">Secondly, paragraph 30 of the report refers to the importance of the reintegration aspect of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, and states that ex-combatants could resort to banditry or return to the bush if adequate reintegration opportunities do not exist. How serious a problem is crime among ex-combatants at present, and does Ambassador Adeniji have a sense of whether the problem is worsening?</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa17">Since May this year, the RUF and the CDF have released more than 12,000 child combatants. Could the Ambassador please elaborate on the concrete measures put in place to provide for the former child combatants?</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa18">My fourth and last question is as follows. The report of the Secretary-General indicates that both CDF and RUF commanders and ex-combatants lack information regarding reintegration support. Which concrete measures have been taken to ensure that the ex-combatants are given clear and adequate information on reintegration and support?</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Neewoor</span> <span class="nation">Mauritius</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">First of all, I wish to thank the representative of Mali for exchanging speaking slots with me, in view of some pressing work which is awaiting my attention. Normally that representative should have spoken before me, in view of the fact that Mali belongs to the region of western Africa. I appreciate it very much.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Allow me to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this public meeting on the situation in Sierra Leone. I wish also to thank Ambassador Adeniji, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sierra Leone, for the excellent work he is doing and also for his very detailed briefing to us this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">My delegation is pleased to note that significant progress is being made in Sierra Leone towards the restoration of peace in the country. Recent developments in the peace process have enhanced the prospects for peace and stability in the not-too-distant future. The international community should, however, remain vigilant in order to avoid any sidetracking of the process by the main protagonists in the conflict, namely the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">My delegation notes with satisfaction that the Abuja meeting has produced positive results, particularly with regard to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. The disarmament of nearly 6,000 combatants and the release of over 1,000 child combatants, as well as the resumption of confidence-building measures by the Sierra Leone Government and the RUF, are positive steps that help to move forward the peace strategy for Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">The ongoing commitment of the RUF to the peace process remains crucial. The RUF should be encouraged to continue to show a firm commitment until the peace process is completed. The enhanced disarmament process that followed the Abuja meeting on 2 May has caused the overall security situation within Sierra Leone to remain relatively calm. The agreement reached by the Civil Defence Force (CDF) and the RUF is a welcome arrangement in their efforts to bring the fighting between the two parties to an end.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">It is encouraging also to note that both the CDF and the RUF are seriously engaged in a simultaneous disarmament process and have returned substantial amounts of weapons, which the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) has destroyed and converted into agricultural tools.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">As the disarmament and demobilization of the RUF continues, it is equally important that the Government of Sierra Leone become increasingly involved in moving the peace process ahead. We are heartened by the preparedness of the Sierra Leone Government to address some of the concerns of the RUF, including the transformation of the RUF into a political party. It is only through the political engagement of the RUF that a peaceful resolution of the conflict can be finally achieved. We encourage the Government of Sierra Leone to undertake further confidence-building measures in an effort to fully integrate the RUF ex-combatants into civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">My delegation fully subscribes to the Secretary-General's view that reintegration remains pivotal to the success of the entire disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. Effective and adequate reintegration opportunities provide the best deterrence to a relapse into rebellious activities by the RUF. The short-term reintegration plan put in place by the Government of Sierra Leone for ex-combatants is a move in the right direction.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">However, my delegation remains concerned over the shortage of resources to bring the plan to fruition. In this regard, my delegation expresses concern over the fact that no pledges were made by the donor community at the donors conference which was held in Paris on 11 and 12 June with a view to generating financial support for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme. We hope that the call of the Secretary-General to the donors to finalize their decision to contribute to the multi-donor trust fund will be heeded. It is a fact that the DDR programme, which is so vital to the success of the overall peace process, cannot be allowed to fail for lack of resources.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">My delegation also welcomes the forward deployment of UNAMSIL and the Mission's ability to implement the second phase of its concept of operations. UNAMSIL's movement into the major diamond-producing area of Koidu testifies to the fact that UNAMSIL is gaining control over areas which were inaccessible to them before. UNAMSIL continues to play a key role in monitoring the implementation of the Abuja Agreement as well as the DDR programme. We look forward to UNAMSIL's implementation of the third phase of the concept of operations, which will involve deployment into diamond-producing regions and some border areas in the eastern provinces.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa11">Given the improvement of the security situation on the ground, my delegation is heartened to learn that preparations for holding elections, most likely in December of this year, are already under way. The intensive civic education campaign designed to inform, educate and raise the awareness of the electorate, should be fully encouraged and supported. The role of UNAMSIL in providing assistance to carry the electoral process forward remains crucial.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa12">My delegation remains deeply concerned over the humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone and the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees in the Mano River Union subregion. As normalcy returns to Sierra Leone, it is expected that a large number of refugees may decide to return by road from Guinea. There is a growing need for more resources to be made available to the Government of Sierra Leone to cope with the influx of returnees as well as the resettlement of the internally displaced persons. The Government must provide basic infrastructure and services to enable the returning refugees to settle down and start their lives afresh. Despite an expansion of humanitarian activities following the deployment of UNAMSIL in many areas formerly under Revolutionary United Front (RUF) control, the Government of Sierra Leone still needs considerable financial and humanitarian support in its efforts to resettle the returning refugees and internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa13">Before I conclude, I wish to pay a warm tribute to the Economic Community of West African States, and in particular its current Chairman, President Konaré of Mali, for its tireless efforts to bring peace and normalcy not only to Sierra Leone but to the Mano River Union subregion in spite of being constrained by the scarcity of resources. I wish to reiterate here once more that regional and subregional organizations have a key role to play in maintaining peace and security in their respective regions. In this regard, they must be fully supported by the United Nations and the international community. I also pay a warm tribute to the men and women of UNAMSIL and to the countries they come from for their important contribution to restoring peace and stability in Sierra Leone.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Shen Guofang</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his tenth report on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Adeniji, for his additional briefing. The content of the report is comprehensive, positive and encouraging, and is conducive to strengthening the confidence of the international community, including the Security Council, in the peace process in Sierra Leone. I also wish to thank you, Mr. President, for convening today's open meeting because the Council's continued attention and timely encouragement will be very important for maintaining the momentum of peace in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">To maintain the momentum of peace, the stabilization of Sierra Leone's military and security situation is of particular importance. We encourage the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to implement the relevant agreements, including the Ceasefire Agreement, and we believe that efforts must be made to effectively prevent the Civil Defence Force from further provocations in order to avoid providing the RUF with a pretext for violating agreements. We should also properly resolve the RUF's concerns regarding security issues because in the long term, this will be conducive to the early achievement of peace in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme is one of the core issues in the Sierra Leone peace process. Currently disarmament efforts have achieved a good momentum. We hope that the tripartite joint committee will continue to play its proper role. But as was mentioned in the report, compared with disarmament, the work of reintegration is more complex, requiring not only short-term efforts, but also long-term planning. We hope that the tripartite joint committee will make further efforts in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">I also wish to mention the question of the provision of funding. We have noted that the donors conference held on 11 June in Paris has achieved good results. We appeal to the donors to provide as soon as possible emergency assistance to Sierra Leone for the DDR programme. This will be of the greatest importance for the systematic fulfilment of the DDR plan by Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">China is on the whole satisfied with the recent work of UNAMSIL and the Special Representative, Mr. Adeniji. Particularly, UNAMSIL has really strengthened its public outreach work with the local population. We support UNAMSIL's efforts on behalf of the peace process. When conditions permit, UNAMSIL's phased operation programme should be carried out and proceed on schedule, because in a definite sense, peace in Sierra Leone is dependent upon UNAMSIL's full deployment in Sierra Leonean territory.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">We wish to commend for the preparatory work for the elections done by the Sierra Leone Government. We support the United Nations provision of technical and logistic assistance to the Sierra Leone Government. In this regard, the Security Council should also encourage UNAMSIL to provide assistance within its capabilities.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">We also hope that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court will be established at an early date and begin their work. China has already decided to provide material assistance to the Special Court. We also hope that the Sierra Leone Government will further strengthen its capacity for restoring State authority, will stabilize its economy and will properly resolve humanitarian issues within Sierra Leone's territory.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">Now I would like to refer to the region as a whole. The problems of West Africa ought to be resolved in an integrated and comprehensive manner. While we are focusing our attention on the peace process in Sierra Leone, we should not forget the other factors of instability in the region. The problems in Liberia are particularly worrisome. The armed conflict in the northern part of Liberia may trigger a new security and humanitarian disaster and will have an impact on the peace process in Sierra Leone. In this regard, we must maintain high vigilance. We wish to commend the Economic Community of West African States for its tireless efforts in resolving problems in the Mano River Union region, and we support its efforts to encourage political dialogue between the leaders of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, for the purpose of stabilizing the tense situation there.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01"> Let me mention that we have a total of 21 speakers on the list, and we need to finish this meeting this morning because we have another meeting scheduled for this afternoon. I would request my colleagues to shorten their speeches as much as possible.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mejdoub</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">I shall act according to your appeal, Mr. President. I thank you for having organized this public meeting on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), and I thank Ambassador Adeniji for having introduced the tenth report of the Secretary-General. My delegation would like to say how much it appreciates the report, which in addition to being particularly exhaustive and full of information, gives us an in-depth analysis of the challenges to be dealt with in Sierra Leone and of the strategy to be adopted in the short and medium term in order to ensure success in the peace process in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">Naturally, my delegation has, with some satisfaction and relief, taken note of the significant progress made in the implementation of the peace process, as noted in the report of the Secretary-General. This progress confirms the positive development of the process since the Abuja meetings, held in May and the beginning of June 2001. We cannot fail to agree with the Secretary-General's conclusion that this two-track approach, military and political, adopted by the international community and the Government of Sierra Leone has started to yield results.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">However, we are not yet at a stage where we can say with assurance that this positive trend is now irreversible. The concerns expressed by the Secretary-General clearly indicate that the peace process is still fragile, and that vigilance should remain the order of the day.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">My delegation is certainly reassured that the Secretary-General and UNAMSIL have already begun to prepare for the critical next stages of the peace process, particularly the third phase of the Mission's concept of operations. We are also encouraged by the steps already taken and planned by the Government of Sierra Leone in order to advance this process, particularly those relating to the political dialogue with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, the restoration of State authority and the recovery activities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">However, ongoing difficulties, which are basically financial in nature, could derail the entire process, especially since they affect such vital activities as the disarmament, demobilization and, in particular, reintegration of ex-combatants, displaced persons and refugees; the restoration of State authority; the organization of elections; and the development and long-term economic recovery of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">We therefore urge the international community to continue to support the people of Sierra Leone and to give it all necessary political and financial assistance. The considerable investments that the international community, and the community of donors in particular, have made over the last 10 years to promote peace in Sierra Leone would be ultimately pointless if they were not reinforced at this highly critical moment in the country's peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">My delegation also believes that the political track should remain a top priority in the quest for a definitive solution to the conflict in Sierra Leone. Tunisia associates itself with the appeal of the Secretary-General to the Government of Sierra Leone and to the RUF leaders to continue to work with dedication and in good faith in this direction. My delegation also believes that the concerns expressed by the RUF about its security and its political future, about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and about the Special Court should be taken into consideration. The goal here is to reconcile the need for the primacy of law with political demands in order to prevent any risk of a reversal in the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">We also believe that the situation in Sierra Leone can be resolved definitively only if security is restored to the region. In this regard, I wish to add my voice to the appeal made by the Secretary-General and other speakers to the leaders of the Mano River Union countries, calling upon them to enter a political dialogue under the aegis of the Economic Community of West African States as soon as possible, in order to reach a common and concerted solution to the alarming security situation in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">I conclude by saying that my delegation awaits with interest the next report of the Secretary-General, which will include his recommendations on the increase of the military component of UNAMSIL in order, to enable it to implement the future phases of the concept of operations. These phases will be critical because they involve the deployment of the mission in the diamond-producing areas and throughout the whole of the country so as to facilitate the holding of elections in Sierra Leone.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">We would like to warmly welcome the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Head of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), Ambassador Adeniji, and thank him for a very comprehensive briefing in presenting the Secretary-General's report. We also welcome the Force Commander.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">We would like to note that the recent positive developments, including the progress in the peace process and the improvement in the security situation in Sierra Leone, provide a unique opportunity for the Government of Sierra Leone and the international community to resolutely pursue their efforts for the restoration of durable peace and stability in that country. The progress in the Sierra Leone peace process testifies to the fact that the two-track approach of the international community's strategy has started to yield positive results.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">However, there are a number of challenges of which we should remain aware if we are to maintain and move forward the momentum achieved. I would like to briefly address some of these challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">First is the importance of the progressive establishment of security throughout the country. We are encouraged by UNAMSIL's successful implementation of the first stages of its concept of operation, and we look forward to its further important deployment across the country within the next stages.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Second is the successful implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, which remains a key element in the overall peace process. The Secretary-General's report outlines the existing problems in this area, including those of reintegration, and underlines the need for increased assistance from the international community. At today's meeting, we had Mr. Adeniji and members of the Council clearly speaking about the importance of a quick and adequate response to the problem of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">The restoration of State authority throughout the country is yet another critical element of stabilization in Sierra Leone. While important steps have already been taken by the Government, with the assistance of UNAMSIL, to restore State administration and public services in some parts of the country, there is much to be done for further extension of State authority, law and order, promoting reconciliation, ensuring long-term recovery and rehabilitation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Success in addressing these challenges is vitally important for creating an environment conducive to the holding of free and fair elections, which constitutes a major goal of the peace process. In the context of the current electoral preparations by the National Electoral Commission, we welcome the increased involvement of the United Nations in support of this process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">The Secretary-General's report addresses the regional dimension of the situation in Sierra Leone, particularly the conflicts in the Mano River Union and the issues of the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons, which remain the source of grave concern. The continued subregional political and humanitarian crisis once again underlines the urgency of restoring security and stability in the subregion through the establishment of political dialogue between the countries of the Mano River Union.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">We highly commend the UNAMSIL military and civilian personnel for their contribution to the progress achieved so far in Sierra Leone, especially the areas of establishing security, promoting disarmament and demobilization, assisting the Government in the restoration of legitimate authority and law throughout the country and supporting the spheres of public information and human rights. There is no area where UNAMSIL would not play a role. My country is particularly proud to be among the contributors to this important peacekeeping mission.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">The United Nations and the international community have invested considerable effort and resources to see to it that peace and stability prevail. Today it is absolutely indispensable that the international community continue its strong support for the emerging signs of peace and stability in the country.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ryan</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">We welcome the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Adeniji, to the Council, and we appreciate his very useful briefing. We also welcome Swedish State Secretary Dahlgren and congratulate him on his recent appointment as European Union Special Representative to West Africa. We look forward to his briefing on the Union's high-level visit, which he led to West Africa from 29-31 May.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">We are encouraged by the Secretary-General's view, reinforced by Ambassador Adeniji this morning, that the current situation in Sierra Leone merits cautious optimism but at the same time continued vigilance. It is clear that the two-track approach, comprising the forward deployment of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and the opening of political dialogue with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), has achieved tangible progress.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">We must ensure that this momentum is not lost but built on. The Council should continue to exert pressure to ensure that the RUF have changed really their approach from bullets to ballots. In this regard, Ireland welcomes the recent practical steps taken by the Government of Sierra Leone to facilitate the transformation of the RUF into a political party.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">Despite the important territorial advances that have been secured and consolidated by UNAMSIL, there remain justifiable concerns at reports of recent attacks by the Civil Defence Force (CDF). Indeed, there were reports last Saturday that the RUF threatened to withdraw its cooperation if, in its view, allegations of CDF attacks were not adequately investigated.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">While the peace process can hardly be driven by the demands of the RUF, there is a real concern here. It is crucial that both the CDF and the RUF are equally aware of their common obligation to facilitate the work of UNAMSIL and to disarm in line with the agreement reached on 15 May in Freetown. Accordingly, it is important that this Council send a strong message to both the RUF and the CDF. They must fulfil the terms of the agreements reached in Abuja on 2 May and in Freetown on 15 May in good faith, completely and simultaneously.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">Ireland welcomes the successful completion on schedule of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme in the Kambia and Port Loko districts. I am very gratified by Mr. Adeniji's report of the success of the test case operation in Kambia. It was exemplary, and it will, I hope, have a well-deserved knock-on impact on the wider process, including along the Sierra Leone-Guinea border. We note that the DDR camps in the Kono region, near Koidu, and in Bonthe will shortly be operational, and we look forward to progress in disarmament in these key areas. We agree fully with the Secretary-General's assessment that the DDR programme is crucial to all aspects of the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">The Secretary-General is absolutely correct to focus on the gaps that remain in the reintegration programme and to state in his report that a provision should be made to track ex-combatants in order to ensure their successful reintegration into society. We welcome the work of the United Nations Development Programme alongside the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation to create income-earning opportunities for ex-combatants in the Kambia region. It is also important, as the Secretary-General notes, that sensitization and awareness campaigns be stepped up for ex-combatants to ensure that they are fully aware of what reintegration support actually entails. We have taken careful note of the Secretary-General's comments about the funding requirements for the DDR programme.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">Ireland welcomed the very positive meeting between Presidents Kabbah and Conté that took place on 3 June, in which the two Presidents agreed to the reopening of the road between Forecariah in Guinea and Kambia in Sierra Leone. Continued close cooperation between the Governments of Sierra Leone and Guinea is very important for the creation of stability in the border area.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">We agree strongly with China that the regional interrelationship is at the heart of both the political and humanitarian problems that afflict the subregion, but also of the solution to those same problems. In that context, we strongly support the Secretary-General's call on the three leaders of the Mano River Union to engage in political dialogue. We strongly endorse the perspective that Assistant Secretary-General Fall brought to the Council on 14 May following the inter-agency mission that he led to West Africa. Ireland regards very highly the tremendous efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to forge regional peace.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">Sadly, Sierra Leone, in addition to -- indeed, largely because of -- the appalling violence it has suffered, still languishes at the bottom of economic development indices. The military work is well under way, but we should be thinking ahead to the urgent task of reconstruction. The restoration of State authority, the provision of basic services, the conduct of free and fair elections and the establishment of good governance are crucial tasks. We are encouraged in that regard by the improvement in the level of coordination between UNAMSIL and the development and humanitarian parts of the United Nations system. Ireland has put on record in the Council our desire to see a joined-up approach in the United Nations, at Headquarters and in the field, and our belief that an entry point for the development dimension must be ensured at all levels. The appointment of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Governance and Stabilization in Sierra Leone, Mr. Alan Doss, has had a positive impact, and we commend his good work.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">The foundation stone of national reconstruction will be individual forgiveness and national reconciliation. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will have a vital role to play in that regard, and I was gratified to hear Mr. Adeniji emphasize that point earlier. But justice too will be required. We are encouraged by the progress made recently in respect of financial commitments to the Special Court for Sierra Leone. I am hopeful that Ireland will very shortly be in a position to pledge a commitment in that regard. We very much hope that other donors will quickly make up the present shortfall. As the Secretary-General emphasized to the Council over lunch yesterday, it would be essential to avoid setting up the Special Court but, because of financial shortfalls, having to suspend its work, perhaps even in mid-session, at some future point.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa12">In closing, let me pay tribute to the excellent work carried out by the staff of UNAMSIL and of the United Nations agencies on the ground. A year ago, the degree of cautious optimism felt today would have been inconceivable. Political courage and farsightedness on the part of the Government of Sierra Leone, and the matching determination of the Council and of the peacekeepers it has deployed, have brought us this far. It is our sincere hope that when we review the next stage -- the next crucial phase of disarmament -- matters will have improved further.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">It is especially good to see the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Adeniji, and Lieutenant-General Opande here, and to do so in a context where, as others have said, there is real reason to be encouraged. It is also good to see that the Secretariat, as set out in the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-627.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/627</a>) and in Mr. Adeniji's very good briefing, is embarking on strategic planning for the way ahead: a plan to extend the authority of the Government of Sierra Leone throughout the national territory; conducting free and fair elections; and restoring to the people of Sierra Leone the mineral wealth to which they are entitled. Those are all certainly critical to consolidating peace.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">Others have recalled that it was only a year ago that United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was almost driven out of Sierra Leone and that the Government was almost driven from power by Liberian-backed rebels, and that it was less than a year ago that the departure of some contingents generated concern that UNAMSIL could never be staffed and indeed that it might collapse entirely. Today, UNAMSIL has recovered. It is achieving the results that the Council wants.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">One year ago, the people of Sierra Leone looked helpless in the face of one of the world's most violent insurgencies, but today they can look to the future with at least a degree of cautious optimism, as the Secretary-General's report said.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">That is a genuine success: a success for the Council, for the United Nations, for the leaders of UNAMSIL and for the troop contributors.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">As UNAMSIL reaches its authorized ceiling, it is important that the United Nations continue to expand its area of operation, and that the Government of Sierra Leone come in behind UNAMSIL with credible restoration of State authority, coupled with increased international humanitarian and human rights activity.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">As the author of the resolution envisaging the Special Court, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1315(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1315 (2000)</a>, I want to say a special word about that, because it was not mentioned very prominently in the briefing, although others have referred to it. Ten months ago, the Council decided that it wanted those most responsible for the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone to be brought to justice. That means a narrowly defined group of ringleaders whose actions have disqualified them from participation in the political life of the country. It means a finite process that will hold a small number of leaders accountable while allowing the rest of Sierra Leone to proceed with the political life of the country. We regret that this vital project has turned into an extremely complex, time-consuming, expensive and inconclusive affair. We need to get on with this.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">Now, we finally have before us, under consideration, a new, more sustainable approach at a reasonable cost. The Secretary-General has recently renewed his appeal for funding. My Government urges all of our partners, and all those interested in justice, to join us in contributing to the fund for the Court so that we can bring it into being. The next step must be for the Court to state whom it intends to prosecute. In our view, this should begin immediately with one person we know to be in detention and who, we all agree, should be brought to justice: Foday Sankoh.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">Our deliberations on the Special Court and the difficulties in bringing it into being have taken place against the backdrop of a new report on the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. That report, by the International Crisis Group, tells us that a staff of almost 800 people, working for seven years, at a cost of $90 million a year, has produced nine convictions, with 43 suspects still awaiting trial and a number of key suspects still at large. The International Crisis Group's report, which I commend to my colleagues, tells us that we must avoid the mistakes made there as we establish the Sierra Leone Special Court.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">Ambassadors Greenstock and Ryan, and others, have talked about the importance of establishing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but also about the need for it to be brought into being along with the Special Court. We agree: both elements of the process of justice need to be created. They both equally need to be brought into being. The Special Court is an element that we consider to be of particular importance.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">We have heard some reservations about the wisdom of moving forward with the Special Court, given the stated commitment of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to the peace process. But we think that there is no conflict between the pursuit of peace and the pursuit of justice; indeed, they must go together. To imply that we must set aside a call for justice in the interest of the desire for peace would, we feel, be to repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa11">The Secretary-General has raised serious concerns about the lack of resources for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. He has also implied that, should voluntary funding not be forthcoming, he will seek assessed funding. Certainly, proceeding with disarmament, demobilization and reintegration is an essential element of the process; indeed, the situation we now confront has been outlined by Mr. Adeniji and is, as he said, an indication of success. That has created a problem. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration are not, in the end, the responsibility of the Security Council, and we question whether assessed contributions are the best means of meeting the need that exists. We note that the donors' conference in Paris sent encouraging signals. We join others in strongly urging that donors come forward with clear pledges to the trust fund to get this effort on a secure footing.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa12">I have outlined a few areas of concern to my Government, but I did so in the belief that a policy that is working needs to be fine tuned. I commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Adeniji and the Force Commander, Lieutenant-General Opande, along with the men and women of UNAMSIL, for their dedication to peace in Sierra Leone, and I assure them of our continued support.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Lee</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">At the outset, Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation to you for convening this meeting. I thank the Secretary-General for his tenth report on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-627.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/627</a>), which cogently sets out the issues for consideration at this crucial period. I also thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Adeniji, for his comprehensive and very useful briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">As the situation in Sierra Leone improves, it is not too early to consider ways in which the economy of that country can ultimately become self-sustaining. In this respect, the export of Sierra Leonean diamonds will play a key role. It is, therefore, imperative that the Government of Sierra Leone establishes effective control over the key diamond-producing areas, such as the Kono district. As such, the disarmament process that will soon be conducted in the Kono and Bonthe districts should be closely monitored.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">At the same time, it must not be forgotten that the mismanagement of diamond resources by previous administrations was one of the root causes of the conflict in Sierra Leone. A new opportunity has presented itself for a better system to be established. This opportunity must not be lost. Therefore, Singapore joins in the Secretary-General's call for the Government of Sierra Leone to give this issue its full attention.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">The Kono region is also the traditional stronghold of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). The ability of UNAMSIL to deploy effectively in this region and the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme thus takes on added significance.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">We note that during the period under review the track record of the RUF has been encouraging but not perfect. My delegation believes that the willingness of the RUF to cooperate partly stems from its continued engagement in talks with the Government of Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL and the renewed engagement of the Civil Defence Force (CDF). These talks have helped to address some of the legitimate concerns of the RUF, for example, with regard to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Special Court and the prospects for reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">My delegation supports the continued engagement of all parties in the peace process. Those with legitimate concerns should be allowed to air them, and these concerns should be addressed as speedily as possible. One such concern that has been expressed is the mistreatment of ex-combatants when they return to their home communities. Such mistreatment could encourage ex-combatants to return to arms. As noted in paragraph 30 of the Secretary-General's report,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg016-bk01-pa07">"The reintegration aspect of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme is pivotal to the success of the entire programme".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">Therefore, it is important to spread the word of tolerance and reconciliation to the peoples of Sierra Leone. The public information arm of UNAMSIL is critical to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme as a whole, but while the word of tolerance is spread to the peoples of Sierra Leone, no tolerance can be shown to any spoiler of the peace process. The Brahimi report calls on the United Nations to</p>
	<blockquote id="pg016-bk01-pa09">"be prepared to deal effectively with spoilers if it expects to achieve a consistent record of success in peacekeeping or peace-building in situations of intrastate/transnational conflict".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">The peace process in Sierra Leone has already been disrupted more than once. While we continue to exercise due diligence to prevent any such recurrence, we must also send a strong message that another attempt to spoil the peace process by any party will not be tolerated.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa11">We would also like to express our recognition of the active role of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in this issue. Singapore joins in the call by both ECOWAS and the Secretary-General for the heads of State of the Mano River Union to meet. Inter-State dialogue is particularly important for the resolution of the refugee crisis, which currently plagues all three countries of the Mano River Union. We agree with the Secretary-General's observation in paragraph 22 of his report dated 23 May, <a href="../pdf/S-2001-513.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/513</a>, regarding this issue, that the presence and movements of refugees and internally displaced persons</p>
	<blockquote id="pg016-bk01-pa12">"place a heavy burden on host States, receiving communities and the environment and may complicate an already fragile situation".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa13">My delegation, therefore, looks forward to the swift return of refugees and internally displaced persons to their places of origin when the time is right.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa14">In conclusion, let me reiterate Singapore's support for the good offices of the Secretary-General, for the sterling work that is taking place in Sierra Leone and, in particular, the men and women of UNAMSIL who are ably led by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Adeniji. Sierra Leone presents the Security Council with an opportunity to turn around what was a dismal situation just a year ago to a success story. This is not the time for complacency; rather, it is a time for sustained efforts in the face of the magnitude of work still before us.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa15">The Security Council must continue to remain seized of this matter.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdivieso</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I would like to express my appreciation for the presentation of the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) by his Special Representative, Mr. Oluyemi Adeniji.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">The delegation of Colombia notes with satisfaction the important progress outlined in the Secretary-General's tenth report and also the broad support and cooperation that UNAMSIL is providing to the authorities of that country. The action of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is contributing positively to this atmosphere, which is favourable to peace. Its sponsorship of the Abuja Agreement last December was crucial to the process.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">I would like to make the following brief comments in that connection. First, my delegation believes that the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone has been moving successfully towards an increasingly complex phase by adding new components, reinforcing others and preparing future deployment plans. We support the Secretary-General's intention to examine the role of the civilian police advisers and to respond favourably to the petition for electoral assistance. We are glad to know that today it is feasible to think about holding elections towards the end of this year.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Secondly, UNAMSIL's presence in areas formerly controlled by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), including some points along the border with Guinea, as well as more permanent patrolling in the Kono district and other diamond-producing areas, reflect the commitment that all members of the United Nations have undertaken with respect to peace in Sierra Leone and stability in Western Africa. The Freetown authorities must respond to this display of support on the part of the international community by restoring in a visible way the authority of the State with a view to providing basic services for the population and holding the forthcoming elections.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Thirdly, my delegation recognizes President Kabbah's efforts to bring about an understanding with the rebels, as was demonstrated by the announcement to release an important group of RUF members who were jailed. We urge him to continue conversations in the Joint Committee and to ease the way for the transformation of this movement into a political party. Preparations for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission must also be accelerated; but we wonder whether it is really the job of the High Commissioner for Refugees to gather funds to establish this Commission. We would like to hear Ambassador Adeniji's comments on this point.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">In the area of justice, we believe that the two components, the Truth Commission and the Special Court, must work on the basis of complementarity as regards the allocation of responsibilities, the exercise of justice and the thwarting of impunity. Colombia is definitely one of the countries that is very interested in justice. We also believe that there cannot be a conflict between the search for peace and the search for justice.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">Fourthly, several delegations have already referred to the sensitive humanitarian situation in the country, which continues to worry us. For the moment, we would merely like to point out that in the process of involving the RUF leadership we see another example of the growing interaction between the United Nations and non-State armed actors. We believe that this relationship should be used to induce them to abide by the standards of international humanitarian law in areas they control, where violations are reported on a daily basis. This is a way of protecting civilians through persuasion, which does not imply any changes to the mandate of the Mission and should be undertaken with no reservations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">Finally, I would like to join with other delegations that have spoken in support of the manner in which the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme is being implemented. We believe, along with the people of Sierra Leone, that since a considerable amount of resources has been invested in deploying a peace mission, the funding for this programme should also be strengthened. The benefits of peace must be explained clearly in terms of the opportunities they would provide for former combatants. These benefits of peace should be made more attractive than any illusory benefits of war.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ouane</span> <span class="nation">Mali</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I would like first of all to thank you, Mr. President, for having organized an open meeting of the Security Council to consider the situation in Sierra Leone. We are grateful in this connection to the Secretary-General for his tenth report on the matter. We thank his Special Representative, Ambassador Adeniji, for his very useful update. We are glad to see the Force Commander of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and the Special Representative of the European Union for West Africa here with us.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">Since the second meeting of the Committee of Six of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Mediation and Security Council with the United Nations, the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), held in Abuja on 2 May 2001, the peace process in Sierra Leone has developed in a constructive manner. Progress recorded in the field of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR), the release of children, the proliferation of meetings among the parties concerned and their commitment to move the peace process forward are elements that could lead to the long-awaited peace in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">In this connection, I have three sets of comments to make.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">First of all, I would like to encourage the Government of Sierra Leone and the leadership of RUF to continue in a resolute manner and in good faith to work towards peace. My delegation is not unaware of the difficulties that still beset the peace process in Sierra Leone, in particular the risk of derailment of the DDR programme because of a lack of funding. This is why we will never stop pleading for the United Nations to insure funding for this vast programme, the success of which is crucial for definitive peace in Sierra Leone. In the same vein, we would like to echo the Secretary-General's appeal to all members of the international community to urgently and generously contribute to the special trust fund for this programme.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">My delegation share the opinion according to which the citizens of Sierra Leone should show tolerance and a willingness to forget in order to set in motion an irreversible process of national reconciliation. To this end, setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a Special Court can make a contribution. But we would like to draw attention to the negative effect of any partial exercise of justice on the peace process that is already under way.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">My second comment is that my delegation remains convinced that there is no military solution to the crisis in Sierra Leone. The dialogue between the Government and the RUF is increasingly directed towards political questions, and we commend the Government for granting assistance to the RUF so that it can be transformed into a political party and participate in the forthcoming elections in the country. These elections, we constantly repeat, will require international assistance if they are to be free and fair. We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his intention to set out in his forthcoming report a number of detailed recommendations concerning the necessary size of UNAMSIL and its tasks in the framework of support for the peace process and the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">My third and final comment is to restate that the resolution of the crisis in Sierra Leone would do much to put an end to armed incursions along the borders of the three countries of the Mano River Union. We are very much preoccupied by the fighting in Liberia and its impact on the civilian population. If this situation is not managed in good time, it could also disturb the fragile peace process in Sierra Leone. I must restate the conviction of the Government of Mali in this connection that regional stability can be resolved only through dialogue. ECOWAS is tirelessly labouring to this end among the heads of State concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">We cannot fail to recall again the ECOWAS decision to deploy troops of the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) along the borders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in order to put an end to armed incursions, to instil trust among the parties, to provide security for refugees and displaced persons and to create the necessary conditions for the provision of humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">Mali will continue to support any initiative or action to restore peace and security in our subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the gratitude of ECOWAS to the Secretary-General for his concern and his commendable efforts for peace and stability in West Africa. We also thank his Special Representative for Sierra Leone, Ambassador Adeniji, and all the staff of UNAMSIL, the troop-contributing countries and humanitarian agencies for their invaluable sacrifice in our subregion. ECOWAS will continue to fully play the part that belongs to it in this process.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Granovsky</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">The Russian delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on progress made in the settlement process in Sierra Leone. We also associate ourselves with the words of gratitude expressed to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Adeniji, for his comprehensive and very informative briefing. We appreciate the opportunity to receive first-hand information and evaluation of the developments of the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">We are pleased at the way the peace process is proceeding in Sierra Leone. The ceasefire is holding; the parties are cooperating with the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) in deploying the contingent of the Mission; and, without a doubt, success has been achieved in disarmament. In our view, this progress confirms the correctness of the strategy for settling the conflict in Sierra Leone that was selected by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">Now it is important to strengthen the tempo of the peace process, primarily by ensuring strict compliance with the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) timetable and extension of State administration deep into the heart of the country, including to the diamond-producing areas.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">We believe that the arrival in Sierra Leone of new UNAMSIL contingents will make it possible to create the necessary conditions for this. We agree with the view of the Secretary-General regarding the need for an immediate increase in financial support to the DDR programme in Sierra Leone by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">We are pleased that in Sierra Leone preparations for the elections are being stepped up. We support the intention of the Secretary-General to provide financial and technical assistance during the election campaign and the elections. We are convinced that in order to establish a solid foundation for peace in Sierra Leone the elections must be democratic and must include all political forces of the country, including the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), provided that the members of that movement are disarmed and that the organization is transformed into a political party.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">In the long term, dealing with the aftermath of the conflict will depend on national reconciliation. There is no doubt that obtaining such a goal will require the just punishment of the principal perpetrators of crimes against humanity committed during the years of conflict in Sierra Leone. At the same time, we deem it appropriate that stress should be placed precisely on reconciliation and on finding out the truth, including through the use of traditional structures and methods. We are convinced that the lessons learned from the bitter experience of the conflict will help the people of Sierra Leone to overcome the aftermath more quickly and to restore a life of peace.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Florent</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">Allow me at the outset to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Adeniji, for his substantial briefing on the situation in Sierra Leone. My delegation also fully associates itself with the very detailed account that Mr. Dahlgren will soon make of the recent mission he led to West Africa. I shall therefore confine my statement to a few points of importance to my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">France is gratified by the constructive developments noted by the Secretary-General in his latest report. We support the resolute approach of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), in conformity with its mandate, to enable the democratically elected Government to regain control of the entire territory of Sierra Leone. This process should be gradual, particularly as we approach the diamond-producing regions in the East, in order to prevent the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) from rearming itself. This positive development will require the Security Council to maintain its support for the search, through dialogue among the contending parties and with the support of the members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), for a political settlement of the conflict. The dialogue must lead, beyond the end of hostilities and the gradual disarmament of the ex-combatants, to the resumption of the peace process, inter alia, through the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the transformation of the RUF into a political party.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">The elections planned for the coming dry season are very welcome. We must also support the efforts of ECOWAS to promote a political dialogue among the three States of the subregion and to encourage the reintegration process in Sierra Leone as the Government regains control of the territory, while providing security for refugees and internally displaced persons and allowing refugees to choose, in full knowledge of the facts, between remaining in Guinea or returning to their country. The authority of the Government and civil society in Sierra Leone must also be restored. As the Secretary-General has pointed out, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme will be of crucial importance.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">In conclusion, France remains concerned by the fate of Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea, a great number of whom have returned spontaneously, often to areas held by RUF. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees must, as planned, proceed as soon as the rains end to return more refugees on a more organized basis.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ward</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">My delegation extends its appreciation to Mr. Adeniji, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), for his briefing and for his introduction of the Secretary-General's report, which provides a detailed assessment of the peace process in Sierra Leone. We welcome the convening of this open meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">I will heed your appeal for brevity, Sir. Having addressed most of these issues in the past, I will draw attention to only a few aspects of the peace process that we simply cannot ignore.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">I agree with Ambassador Greenstock and others that both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court are essential dual tracks to reconciliation in Sierra Leone. I urge the donor community to respond positively to the appeals for funding of these programmes. Jamaica looks forward to the Secretary-General's upcoming report on establishing the Special Court.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">While we stress the importance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court in terms of reconciliation, we cannot overemphasize the importance of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. There can be no lasting peace in Sierra Leone without an adequately funded disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. We note the conclusion of the Secretary-General that, unless voluntary contributions are received in sufficient amounts on an urgent basis, alternative funding mechanisms will have to be considered. We are grateful to those donor countries that have so far contributed according to their ability to do so, and we join in the appeal to others who have not yet done so.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">We cannot overemphasize the importance of the reintegration of ex-combatants into Sierra Leonean society and of finding them sustainable employment opportunities. This is critical to the success of the peace process. Past experience has taught us that, if ex-combatants are not gainfully employed, they could easily return to a life of war or banditry. That warning was given this morning by Mr. Adeniji. We all agree that this prospect constitutes a major risk to the long-term stability of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">My delegation welcomes the positive reports concerning improved access to humanitarian workers across the country. While it is necessary that the short-term needs of refugees and internally displaced persons be addressed, it is equally important that long-term plans regarding assistance to the Government of Sierra Leone to absorb the returnees into society also be considered. We support the view that there needs to be more focused attention to the provision of basic services and infrastructure, which no doubt will require funding.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">Finally, my delegation is heartened that UNAMSIL continues to enhance its capacity to disseminate information to Sierra Leonean society regarding its role in the peace process. We especially commend the public information programmes being undertaken by UNAMSIL, which seek to engage society at large.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, allow me to commend Mr. Adeniji and the staff of UNAMSIL for their sterling contributions to promoting peace in Sierra Leone.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01"> I now call on the representative of Sierra Leone.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kamara</span> <span class="nation">Sierra Leone</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">My delegation, Sir, commends your stewardship of the Security Council for the month of June and appreciates the convening of this particular meeting on Sierra Leone to discuss the latest report of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">My delegation also wishes to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Cunningham of the United States, for a job very well done during the month of May.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">My delegation would like to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Oluyemi Adeniji, for his comprehensive and brilliant briefing this morning. We also welcome Lieutenant-General Opande, who is here with Mr. Adeniji.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">My delegation welcomes the tenth report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), noting its very candid, comprehensive and balanced nature. We also note that the message put forth by the Secretariat in the report is very encouraging. We also wish to convey to the Secretariat that the Sierra Leonean people sincerely intend to make the best possible use of the current unique opportunity created by the international community's significant investment within Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">The relaunching of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme in May 2001, after the Abuja review meeting between the Government and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), has met with considerable success in that a large quantity of arms and ammunition has been deposited with UNAMSIL by the RUF rebel forces and the Civil Defence Force (CDF) and that a sizeable number of ex-combatants has also been demobilized. We are especially elated over the release of child soldiers and abductees so that their lives may be set back on their proper courses.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">However, I must inform the Council that the reduction in the momentum of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme has largely been due to the extreme lack of fiscal resources. The inadequacy of accommodations to encamp the ex-combatants in various districts within the country in order for them to be appropriately demobilized is but one of the many difficulties confronting the pace of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">My Government is currently in the process of coming to grips with the magnitude of the problem of reintegration, which, as noted in the Secretary-General's report, is pivotal to the success of the entire programme.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">The Government has currently embarked on a short-term reintegration programme for ex-combatants, which should jump-start their respective absorption into society. But it is imperative to further sensitize those members of the RUF and the CDF to the fact that reintegration support is not and will not be a long-term measure. It must be strongly emphasized to them that the temporary handouts are not meant to be a continuous source of funding, as a measure of dispelling their unrealistic assumptions.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">In this vein, we require the commitment and support of the international community to assist us to secure adequate resources to enable the Government to properly achieve this objective.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">The World Bank Paris donor conference, held on 11 and 12 June, dampened my Government's enthusiasm towards the international community's full-fledged support for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. However, we have not lost hope and faith in the push towards concluding this exercise, since the future of the overall peace process hinges on the successful implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme. The United Nations and, indeed, the international community must not fail the Government of Sierra Leone in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">My Government is appreciative of the Secretary-General's efforts to secure additional troops for the build-up of UNAMSIL's military component, in accordance with operative paragraph 2 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1346(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1346 (2001)</a> of 30 March 2001. More importantly, we wish to pay tribute to the troop-contributing countries for heeding the Secretary-General's request.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa12">We have taken due note of the fact that there are almost 13,000 military personnel within UNAMSIL and that the period of the third phase of operations is due to commence shortly. However, the current security of the State, which remains hampered by capacity constraints, rests on the ability of UNAMSIL to rapidly react and to enforce preventive measures before any unforeseen disturbance.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa13">Although we are now treading on the path to peace, my delegation is of the conviction that the authorized troop strength of 17,500 military personnel should be met, especially when UNAMSIL will prepare to embark on the fourth phase of operations leading up to the elections.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, and our former colleague, Mr. Hans Dahlgren. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dahlgren</span> <span class="nation">Sweden</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak on behalf of the European Union and to report on a recent European Union mission to Sierra Leone and other West African countries.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">Arriving in Freetown, it is not far to go from the Hastings airport to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) headquarters on the peninsula, but it is still far enough to see that things are changing in Sierra Leone. Freetown is a rapidly growing city, full of activities everywhere. One can see people returning who had to flee in the past, and refugees coming in from camps and elsewhere as well.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">But this involves also driving past another kind of camp -- the camp of the mutilated. That is where some of the international non-governmental organizations are helping many of those who suffered from the worst atrocities of the rebels, those who lost their ears and their arms in the most cruel acts of terror, committed also on women and children. This is a reminder of what has occurred during the tragic civil war in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">To meet some of the children in this camp, deprived not only of their parents and their childhood but also of parts of their own bodies, is to feel not only sympathy but also outrage over these awful crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">From this camp, it is just a few miles down the road to UNAMSIL headquarters. They also bustle with life. United Nations officials of many nationalities are hard at work there, and there is a feeling of confidence in the air. When I visited this very same place two and half years ago on behalf of one of the Security Council sanctions committees, I remember that building being frighteningly empty. Some Nigerian soldiers were standing out in the hallways, but the rebels had been sighted just a few miles outside Freetown, and, a few weeks later, they had taken over the city.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">Coming back now, on behalf of the troika of the European Union, we found the ceasefire holding. We saw the beginning of the dialogue between the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the Government of Sierra Leone. The RUF, I understand, has even been offered one of the Government buildings for rent and has been issued a temporary registration as a political party. This is real progress. It speaks well for those who are participating in the dialogue, but it also calls for a special tribute to the men and women of UNAMSIL. Their efforts to stabilize the situation and to help with disarmament, demobilization and reintegration are indeed leading to results.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">We heard firsthand from the United Nations observers who are actively engaged in collecting and destroying weapons and ammunition about the steady progress of these efforts, with the possibility of concluding the disarmament phase perhaps as soon as this coming August.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">Of course, it is still too early to be sure, but it seems as if President Kabbah and his Government are on the right track. The plans for national elections can soon start to be implemented. We hope that the former rebels will be fully reintegrated, taking into account the need for justice to be served with respect to the atrocities committed.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">Civilian institutions and basic social services also need to be re-established in the former rebel territories. The European Union stands ready to support this peaceful and positive development in Sierra Leone, including the holding of free and fair elections, as we have supported the work of UNAMSIL. The European Union and its member States are now looking actively at the possibility of increasing our contribution to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">Let me also commend the Council and the Secretary-General for having responded to the challenging situation in Sierra Leone in the past not by withdrawing but by reinforcing in time of crisis. That, as we see now, was indeed the right thing to do.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">The European Union troika came to Sierra Leone as part of a mission to the entire Mano River region. The political and humanitarian crisis there has long been of particular concern to the Union. We started our mission by going to Mali, to the presidency of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to express our support for what it and President Konaré are doing to find a political solution to the crisis in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa12">We found the President of Mali to be particularly concerned about the deterioration of relations between Guinea and Liberia. He has made several attempts to organize a meeting between the leaders of those two countries, but those have so far failed, despite the help given also by the President of Senegal and the President of Nigeria.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa13">President Konaré said that he hoped that the international community would support the efforts of ECOWAS and assist in pressing for a dialogue between Liberia and Guinea. The European Union is ready to give such support. One of the main messages of the troika mission was to encourage the parties here to solve the conflict by political means.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa14">There are indeed serious differences that have to be overcome. President Conté of Guinea, for example, reiterated his position that he would not enter into a direct dialogue with President Taylor of Liberia as long as his own country was being violently provoked. It will not come as a surprise to the Council that President Taylor gave a different description of the conflict in the border area. He claims that Liberia was being attacked by Guinea, but that he nonetheless is open to talks with President Conté.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa15">ECOWAS is seriously considering putting up a border force between Guinea and Liberia, which could help prevent a direct military confrontation between those two countries. The European Union could support such a plan, provided that the mandate is reasonable and the countries concerned give their consent and cooperation. President Conté said that he was not against a border force as a matter of principle, but he insisted that it should be deployed in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and not on his own territory.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa16">President Taylor in Liberia said that he accepted the force, while there was substantial scepticism in Sierra Leone towards the idea, based perhaps primarily on the limited size that is currently envisaged.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa17">President Konaré also expressed a strong wish for increased cooperation in general between the European Union and ECOWAS, and we have responded in the same spirit. ECOWAS is becoming more and more involved in conflict prevention, but in many cases it lacks resources and capacity to implement all its own decisions. The European Union has started to support the building-up of such capacity here, and we encourage contributions from others as well.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa18">When the Security Council earlier this year adopted a new sanctions regime for Liberia, this was strongly endorsed by the European Union. We believe all efforts must be made to end Liberia's military and financial support for and contacts with the rebel groups in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in the region. We also approve of the way these new sanctions have been structured, not only directly targeting arms transfers but also regulating the diamond trade and imposing travel bans.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa19">Meeting with President Taylor in Monrovia, we repeated to him our endorsement of these sanctions. We said that it was up to him and his Government to prove to the international community that they fully comply with the demands of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1343(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1343 (2001)</a>. It is our understanding that the political and psychological impact of the sanctions is being felt quite strongly in Liberia. In that sense, these sanctions already work. President Taylor obviously thinks that they are unfair, but he said to us that he accepts the sanctions as a political reality and that he would comply with the demands imposed on him.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa20">That, of course, remains to be seen. President Taylor particularly emphasized the need for an independent United Nations mechanism that could control sanctions. We, on our side, suggested that the best course for the Government of Liberia would be to cooperate fully with the sanctions Committee chaired ably by Ambassador Mahbubani. That Committee has an important responsibility in ensuring the effective implementation of the sanctions as long as they are in force.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa21">The humanitarian situation in the Mano River region continues to be extremely serious. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are still suffering from previous hostilities in Sierra Leone as well as from new clashes along the border between Guinea and Liberia. The European Union recognizes the substantial efforts made by the Government of Guinea in hosting most of these refugees. We welcomed the assurances on refugee security that were given to the new United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees when he visited Guinea in February.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa22">As regards the situation in northern Liberia, in and around Lofa County, the actual situation is still unclear to us. We hear estimates of very large numbers of internally displaced persons, but it is difficult to establish reliable statistics, since very few external actors are permitted access to the area. Just in the last few days, we have heard from refugees fleeing by sea of a deteriorating situation. Also the human rights situation in Liberia is getting worse and should be given increased attention. The European Union intends to conduct an open and frank dialogue with the Liberian Government on this and on the need for a global solution to the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa23">We found in the Mano River countries a strong fear that the conflict there would spread to neighbouring countries. If instability persists in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, there is a clear risk that we will see an economy in the future dominated by illicit trafficking in arms and goods, by mercenaries and other elements with potentially destabilizing effects for the whole region.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa24">It is the view of the European Union that the humanitarian and political crisis in this area cannot be solved without a direct dialogue between the Governments concerned. President Kabbah's initiative to engage the countries of Mano River in a dialogue could be a first step, one that we would like to support. It is also vital that the international community -- all of us -- act in a coordinated manner in basic confidence-building measures. However welcome, stabilization in only one country is not sufficient for overall stability in the subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa25">The European Union and its member States make up an important part of the donor community in this region. We would like to increase our coordination with others, in particular with the United Nations. We see scope also for more general cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations in West Africa and in the Mano River region in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa26">This statement has dealt with a region far away from Europe, from our own continent. That does not lessen our concern over a political and humanitarian crisis that has led to so much unnecessary suffering. These are countries rich in natural resources, with the most beautiful scenery. The people around the Mano River should be able to develop their land, look forward to a prosperous future and leave civil strife behind. Their children should be able to go to school, not have to go to war. For the United Nations, as for the European Union and the world community at large, there could be no finer mission than to assist these people in making that come true.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Pakistan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ahmad</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">We welcome this timely public meeting to discuss the Secretary-General's latest report on the situation in Sierra Leone. We also welcome the statement by Ambassador Oluyemi Adeniji, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Sierra Leone. I wish through you, Mr. President, to assure Ambassador Adeniji of Pakistan's fullest cooperation with him in his efforts to facilitate restoration of durable peace and stability in Sierra Leone, a country with which we have strong and abiding bonds of friendship.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa02">Even as I speak, Pakistan is in the process of deploying its contingent in Sierra Leone. I am pleased to announce that as of today a total of 910 Pakistani peacekeepers have arrived in Sierra Leone. They are a part of the first batch of over 4,300 Pakistani troops who will be taking up their duties as part of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). In spite of logistical problems not of our making, we are implementing the timeline for our deployment, which will be completed in August this year. When I speak of the logistical problems, I refer to the fact that since the aircraft provided to transport our troops is, perhaps, of the forties vintage, it developed some problem and had to land somewhere en route. That is why a new aircraft had to be brought in to take our troops to Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa03">Our decision to participate in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone was motivated by our commitment to the cause of peace and the United Nations peacekeeping role the world over. This commitment is time-honoured and unconditional. Our presence in UNAMSIL will be yet another manifestation of our long-standing and well established commitment to peace and prosperity in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa04">Over the years, we have followed the situation in Sierra Leone very closely and with concern. We are therefore pleased to see in the Secretary-General's report some signs of improvement in the political and economic situation in the country. We share the Secretary-General's cautious optimism on the positive developments which have taken place recently, including the forward deployment of UNAMSIL and the relaunching of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme. We also appreciate the bold steps that have been taken by the Government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in moving towards peace and reconciliation. We believe that even bolder steps need to be taken by all concerned to ensure the effective implementation of the Abuja Accords and the rehabilitation of communities adversely affected by the war.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa05">However, we also agree with the Secretary-General's views that in spite of hopeful signs, many challenges and difficulties remain. In addition, there is also a danger of complacency. We saw only last year how a promising situation so easily and so quickly deteriorated into chaos. We need, therefore, to guard against over-optimism. The Security Council and the Secretariat must not only remain vigilant, but also ensure that mistakes of the past are not repeated.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa06">We therefore urge both the Security Council and the United Nations Secretariat to work closely with all the relevant actors, including troop-contributors, to ensure success for our joint efforts in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa07">While the situation still remains uncertain, we hope that we now have a window of opportunity on which we can capitalize, and replace war and terror with peace. We consider the recent developments but a first step in the long and arduous process of building peace and reconciliation in a country which has seen some of the most brutal forms of conflict. The earlier we, the international community, can bring the country back to normal, the better. This includes the return of refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes, the restoration of State authority throughout the country and the reconstruction of a society so heavily scarred by war.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa08">Moreover, we feel that the problem that afflicts Sierra Leone is not restricted to that country alone. The difficult humanitarian and security situation in all three Mano River Union countries -- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia -- is clear for all of us to see. We therefore also need to address the entire subregion as a whole, not just one country at a time. We must work constructively with all three countries not only to try to remove the tensions between them, but also to find ways to collectively address all their problems. To this effect, we fully support the efforts which are being made by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and we urge the United Nations also to take a more proactive role in finding a comprehensive solution to the subregion's problems.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa09">We believe that collective and determined efforts are now under way, not only on the part of the Government and the people of Sierra Leone, but also by others from both within the region and beyond, to heal and reconstruct this war-ravaged country. Pakistan is looking forward to working with all concerned parties to achieve our joint objective of restoring permanent peace and stability to Sierra Leone.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01"> The next speaker is the representative of Nigeria. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mbanefo</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">I wish to join the others who preceded me in expressing our felicitations and congratulating you, Mr. President, on holding this debate on the tenth report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">Our delegation is happy to note that the Abuja Ceasefire Agreement between the Government of Sierra Leone and the members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) is still holding, despite initial hitches and problems. It will be recalled that at the meeting held in Abuja on 2 May 2001 to review the Ceasefire Agreement, it was observed that there were ceasefire violations by the Civil Defence Force (CDF). At that meeting, it was also agreed that the CDF and the RUF should disarm simultaneously, and that all fighting groups should release all abductees, in particular child combatants. The meeting further urged the two parties to create an atmosphere conducive to the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">Considering that barely a year ago, particularly after the abduction of 500 United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone soldiers, many thought the situation in Sierra Leone was hopeless. Today we are happy to see that tangible progress is being made in Sierra Leone. The deployment of UNAMSIL soldiers to Lunsar, Makeni and Magburaka, as well as the extension of patrols to Koidu, which is a major diamond-producing centre, and to areas like Kailahun, Buedu and Kabala, is also a welcome development. Surely this is as a result of the improvement in the leadership and professionalism of UNAMSIL. In this regard, we wish to commend the tireless efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sierra Leone, Ambassador Oluyemi Adeniji, and the able leadership of UNAMSIL. We believe that the arrival of the Third Battalion from Bangladesh, the Ukrainian aviation unit and the advance party of the Pakistani contingent will further strengthen the ability of UNAMSIL to effectively deploy all over the country.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">Indeed, it is gratifying to observe the progress being made in the implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme. We are happy to note the increasing number of combatants, both in the RUF and the CDF, being disarmed at the various DDR centres in Port Loko, Bo, Kenema, Daru, et cetera. The total number of ex-combatants who have been disarmed since 18 May 2001 stands at 5,669, of which 1,808 are from the RUF and 3,861 from the CDF. The number of weapons collected is 2,991, along with more than 150,000 rounds of assorted ammunition. It is also noteworthy that weapons handed in by the RUF in the Kambia district were of serviceable quality and included several heavy weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">However, our delegation wishes to observe that accommodations at the various disarmament, demobilization and reintegration centres have proved to be inadequate, resulting in overcrowding and water shortages. Also, we wish to observe that there is still a critical gap in the reintegration programme, including the absence of a bridge between demobilization and reintegration. Without effective and adequate reintegration opportunities, the ex-combatants could resort to banditry or return to the bush. This is why we urge that in the short term, ex-combatants be provided with adequate food, materials, cash and vocational training to enable them to return to civil life. In the long term, employment and other forms of income generation will depend on the revival of the economy. One step in the right direction is donors conference organized by the World Bank, held in Paris from 11 to 12 June 2001, to generate financial support for the DDR programme in Sierra Leone, through the World Bank-managed multi-donor trust fund. We call on donor countries to seize the opportunity presented by the ceasefire in Sierra Leone to successfully implement the DDR programme. We also wish to draw attention to the urgent need for humanitarian assistance in the refugee camps.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">The restoration of the authority of the Government of Sierra Leone to all areas of the country and the restoration of basic public services and infrastructure is another critical element in the peace process. We are happy to note that UNAMSIL is assisting the Government of Sierra Leone in this regard. We are also glad to note that UNAMSIL is helping to train new Sierra Leone police recruits and providing advice on investigation methods and the deployment of police officers throughout the country. We look forward to the Secretary-General's recommendation on the review of the role of United Nations police advisers in the current environment in Sierra Leone. We also support the need to bring the civilian police component of UNAMSIL to its authorized strength of 60 civilian police advisers as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">The issue of elections in Sierra Leone, scheduled for December this year, is critical to the whole peace process. We commend the Government of Sierra Leone for its commitment to the democratic process in spite of the difficulties confronting it. We urge the RUF to form a political party and to participate in the forthcoming election. Furthermore, we call on the United Nations to provide support to ensure a free and fair election. We further urge the Government of Sierra Leone to help to smooth this process.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">In spite of the recent progress, the situation of internally displaced persons and returnees in Sierra Leone continues to be a major cause for concern. We hope that UNAMSIL will continue to carry out regular monitoring of human rights abuses in all the areas in which it is deployed. We welcome the release of over 1,000 abducted children, 870 of them released by the RUF. We encourage this development, and we hope that all other children will be released soon.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa09">Furthermore, we urge that action be expedited on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court. Of the estimated $57 million earmarked for the Special Court, only $34 million in pledges has been received. In this regard, we appeal to donors to make additional contributions so that the Special Court can be established.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa10">Finally, our delegation would like to commend the Secretariat, in particular the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and his team, for the progress made so far in Sierra Leone. Also, we would like to commend the improved level of consultations between the Secretariat and the troop-contributing countries. As a result of these consultations, the troop contributors and the Secretariat have been able to understand each other better.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa11">In conclusion, the positive developments in Sierra Leone over the past few months are an indication of what can be achieved when we are all committed to the peace process. We therefore call on the RUF, as well as the Government of Sierra Leone, to continue to work resolutely and in good faith towards achieving peace. We also call on the leaders of the Mano River Union countries to start without delay a political dialogue that will have as its principal objective the restoration of security and stability in the subregion. Developments in Sierra Leone signal momentum in the right direction. This window of opportunity must be encouraged and supported.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa02">We appreciate the comprehensive and insightful briefing by Special Representative Adeniji. We have great appreciation for Ambassador Adeniji's leadership of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and his contribution to peace in Sierra Leone and the Mano River region. We also record our appreciation for Force Commander General Opande for leading the forces in an effective manner.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa03">It is clear that a number of things are going in the right direction in Sierra Leone. The Abuja Agreement is being implemented. The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) is sticking to its promises and participating in particular in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR), although it has yet to deliver on all counts. The Kambia disarmament exercise has given impetus to disarmament throughout Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa04">We are happy that UNAMSIL is continuing to expand its range of activities in Sierra Leone to facilitate the peace process. We are happy that the Bangladesh contingent has helped by maintaining, since much earlier than envisaged, a continuous patrol presence in Kono, which is a vital diamond-producing area, building confidence and UNAMSIL's operational effectiveness. I thank Ambassador Adeniji for his words of appreciation for the positive contribution of the Bangladesh contingent.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa05">We welcome the release of over 1,000 children by armed groups, and we strongly urge that armed groups, in particular the RUF, immediately release all children, including girls, remaining with them.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa06">We were encouraged to learn that prospects for elections during the next dry season are brightening. We welcome the intention of the Secretary-General to respond positively to the request made by the National Electoral Commission for the support of the United Nations in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa07">Although these positive developments have taken place, the situation in Sierra Leone continues to be very fragile. We are particularly concerned about three areas. First is the difficult situation in the subregion as a whole. We believe that there is no alternative to dialogue among leaders of the Mano River Union for a longer-term solution. In this regard, we appreciate the contribution of the Economic Community of West African States in fostering regional peace and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa08">Secondly, the humanitarian situation remains critical. Reports of violations of the human rights of internally displaced persons and detainees cause concern to us. Thirdly, resources are not forthcoming. Enough resources are not there to take the DDR programme beyond August. We are concerned that the donors conference on 11-12 June in Paris did not result in any concrete pledges, and there are already signs of DDR slowing as a result of the lack of resources to keep the initial momentum going.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa09">The Special Court on Sierra Leone is still in the making because the resources available are not enough and scanty commitments to the United Nations appeals for the subregion and for Sierra Leone have not improved in spite of the improvements on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa10">To sustain peace in Sierra Leone, the international community will have to sustain its assistance. We will not have peace in Sierra Leone on a shoestring. Key to lasting peace in Sierra Leone is the rebuilding of the economy. Steps to achieve that are DDR, national reconciliation, in particular through the early set-up of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court, the restoration of State authority, elections, and the promotion of the rule of law and respect for human rights. While UNAMSIL will be assisting in these steps, the support of the international community and the right measures by the Government of Sierra Leone will bring ultimate success.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa11">We agree with the Secretary-General that there could be the need for a further increase in the strength of UNAMSIL, especially in view of the forthcoming elections. We agree that the civilian police component in Sierra Leone needs to be strengthened. We believe that the public information capacity of UNAMSIL should be increased along with the strengthening of other peace-building components.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa12">The Government of Sierra Leone will also have to do its part. Taking the opportunity of the forward deployment of UNAMSIL, it has to extend State administration, law and order and basic services.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa13">Let me conclude by reiterating Bangladesh's continued commitment to peace in Sierra Leone. We have never doubted the usefulness of international peacekeeping in Sierra Leone, even during what Ambassador Adeniji mentioned as being the darkest days of UNAMSIL. We are happy that the risks we collectively took for peace in Sierra Leone have achieved some tangible results. Now it is incumbent on us all to build on that for lasting peace in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa14">I resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa15">I shall now give the floor to Ambassador Adeniji to respond to the comments made and questions raised.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adeniji</span> <span class="non-nation">Special Representative of the Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your comments, and I thank members of the Security Council and those who have been invited by the Council to participate in this open meeting for the comments they have made.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa02">As I said earlier, the support of the Security Council has been very instrumental in bringing us to where we are today.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa03">A few questions were posed, and I will try to quickly answer those questions.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa04">Several questions were posed by the representative of Norway. One was on the quantity of weapons that have been collected as compared with the number of disarmed combatants. I think it should be borne in mind that the weapons that were collected represented both the personal weapons of combatants and group weapons: weapons that were used by a group of combatants, not just by individuals. Because of that, the number of weapons will not really be very great as compared with the number of combatants who were disarmed. Basically, our requirement for anyone to enter the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme is that he or she either must produce a personal weapon or must belong to a group that had used a group weapon -- and that the group weapons must be produced along with the combatants who had used them. We intend to stick with that requirement, with some flexibility in some cases as we go along.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa05">With respect to the quality or the nature of the weapons that were submitted under the programme, I would say that they range from personal weapons, to machine guns, to mortars, to artillery weapons, and even to anti-aircraft guns.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa06">A question was also raised about the possibility of crime among ex-combatants. While that has not yet reached an alarming state, particularly because of the numbers involved in the disarmament process -- just about a quarter of the total declared number of combatants who have to be disarmed -- nevertheless the alarm has to be sounded right now, from the beginning, that the greatest danger that could result from disarmed combatants who are just left on their own is certainly that of crime. They might take to criminal activity as a means of sustaining themselves. That is why great emphasis is being placed on reintegration programmes, and that is why it is absolutely essential that those reintegration programmes be well funded: in order to make sure that ex-combatants are equipped for a productive, useful life in the future, a life which would contribute not only to their own sustenance and that of their families, but to the overall development of Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa07">A question was raised about the fate of child combatants. Just as reintegration programmes are being developed for adult combatants, so also in the case of child combatants. As a matter of fact, once those child combatants are delivered by the fighting forces, they are taken to centres which are run by various humanitarian agencies. These agencies have formed a group called the Sierra Leone Child Protection Network. The children are given counselling to let them know that they no longer belong to fighting forces, but that they are now normal children, and to help them readjust to their new status as normal children. They receive psycho-social counselling; they also receive educational support. In fact, most of them indicate that their one ambition is to go, or go back, to school. The arrangements are made by the Child Protection Network, in collaboration with the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation. The National Commission also helps ensure that school facilities are provided for them.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa08">The next question concerned information on reintegration programmes for ex-combatants. There had been something of a lacuna in the past between what was available on the one hand and knowledge on the part of disarmed combatants about the availability of such facilities on the other. But that has been addressed through a joint effort by the secretariat of the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation and the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). We are now ensuring that adequate information is provided to disarmed combatants in the disarmament and demobilization camps before they are finally demobilized, during the four-week period or whatever other period they choose to stay: all the information about the options that are available to them, so that once they are demobilized and go back to their villages, they can make up their minds about precisely which reintegration projects they want to enter.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa09">The last question that was asked -- I believe by the representative of Colombia -- was whether it was the duty of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to collect funds for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. That is what exists in the enabling instrument for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I think it was put there because of the record on raising resources for issues that concern human rights by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I think it is a task that is taken very, very seriously. What is required, of course, is support and encouragement for the High Commissioner by donors, as set out in the concluding part of the tenth report of the Secretary-General on UNAMSIL. The Secretary-General, of course, recognized the fact that many calls are being made on the resources of donors for the peace process. But these are all essential ingredients in ensuring a lasting peace in Sierra Leone, so we hope that donors will not show any fatigue at this stage of the process, and that the response to the campaign to launch the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will be not only adequate but also prompt, so that, as has been said here by several speakers, the Commission and the Special Court, which are meant to assist the people of Sierra Leone in addressing the events of the past and therefore in being able to look forward to a life of national reconciliation and national forgiveness, can be put in place. One must certainly not be at the expense of the other, and one must certainly not be far away from the other.</p>

	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01"> I thank Mr. Adeniji for his remarks and for his responses to the points raised during the debate. I believe that those responses will be very useful for members and others who participated in this debate, to help them understand the situation in Sierra Leone and the activities of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa02">There are no further speakers on my list. The Council has thus concluded the present stage of it consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
