	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council reiterates its previous resolutions and presidential statements on Somalia, in particular its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1744(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1744 (2007)</a> and presidential statement <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-13.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/13</a>, adopted on 30 April 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council reiterates its support for the National Reconciliation Congress as a mechanism for much-needed political dialogue and reconciliation in Somalia. The Security Council calls on the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and the National Governance and Reconciliation Committee to ensure that the Congress convenes as soon as practicable. The Security Council appreciates the efforts of Member States and partners to support the early convening of the Congress and calls for further support. The Security Council underscores the importance of the Congress addressing in a comprehensive and meaningful manner issues of political reconciliation, including representation in the Transitional Federal Institutions, and agreeing a roadmap for the remainder of the transitional political process, in line with the Transitional Federal Charter and as laid out in the Roadmap to Governance, National Dialogue, and Reconciliation in Somalia of 14 March 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its grave concern regarding the recent pattern of attacks by extremist elements in Somalia, including the increased use of explosive devices, and condemns all attempts to use violence to undermine the political process and prevent the early convening of the National Reconciliation Congress. The Security Council calls on all Member States to cease immediately any further support for extremist elements or those who seek to block progress by violent means, and to support the ongoing efforts towards inclusive political dialogue. The Security Council recalls its readiness, as set out in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1744(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1744 (2007)</a>, to consider measures against those who block progress in the political process and threaten the Transitional Federal Institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council condemns the attack on the Prime Minister on 3 June 2007 and the attack on the forces of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) in Mogadishu on 16 May 2007. The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathies to the families of the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council underlines its appreciation for the efforts of the Ugandan forces currently deployed in Mogadishu under AMISOM and Uganda's invaluable contribution to peace and stability in Somalia. The Security Council reiterates its call on Member States of the African Union to contribute troops for AMISOM, and on other States and partners to provide financial, technical and logistical support for this effort.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council emphasizes the urgent need for appropriate contingency planning for a possible United Nations mission, to be deployed in Somalia if the Security Council decided to authorize such a mission. The Security Council looks forward to receiving the report from the Secretary-General regarding progress in this regard by mid-June.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council emphasizes again the need for strengthened efforts to provide humanitarian relief assistance to Somalia, including assistance to the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, urges Member States to support generously such operations, and demands that all parties ensure unfettered access for humanitarian assistance."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-19.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/19</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
