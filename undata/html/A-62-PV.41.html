<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pak Gil Yon</span> <span class="nation">Democratic People's Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">I have the honour to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.4</a>, entitled "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">The inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang from 2 to 4 October 2007 witnessed the adoption of the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. The second of its kind since the year 2000, the summit provided an important opportunity to begin a new phase for peace, common prosperity and reunification on the Korean peninsula, by taking inter-Korean relations to a higher stage through the Joint Declaration of 15 June 2000 and the spirit of "by our nation itself".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The draft resolution welcomes and supports the inter-Korean summit, including its adoption of the Declaration, and encourages both sides to implement it scrupulously and in good faith. The draft also invites Member States to support and assist the current, positive process.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">The adoption of the draft resolution will further contribute to the achievement of durable peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula and peace and stability in the rest of the world. Therefore, I hope that it will be adopted by consensus.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of the Republic of Korea to also introduce <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.4</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Choi Young-jin</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me this opportunity to introduce the draft resolution entitled "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula". Issued as a document of the General Assembly under the symbol <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>, the draft resolution was jointly prepared and submitted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">The inter-Korean summit was held from 2 to 4 October 2007 in Pyongyang, where President Roh Moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong Il adopted the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. While reconfirming the commitment to peace and prosperity, which are consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, that unique Declaration sets forth a paradigm that is intended to have salutary effects on future inter-Korean relations. The Declaration calls for both Koreas to work towards establishing a peace regime on the Korean peninsula, and this notion is consistent with the Korean peoples' ethos, which contemplates eventual reunification. To obviate military altercations, President Roh Moo-hyun and his counterpart agreed to set up a peace zone in the West Sea and explored the feasibility of designating the area as a common fisheries zone.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa03">At the summit, both President Roh and Chairman Kim expressed their commitment to denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This intention is reflected unequivocally in the Declaration, which calls on both sides to implement fully the 19 September Joint Declaration and the 13 February Agreement of the Six-Party Talks, so as to resolve the nuclear issue.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa04">In tandem with the inter-Korean summit, the most recent round of the Six-Party Talks, held in Beijing, concluded on 3 October. At these talks, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expressed its intention to disable its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. The dynamics of the two meetings indicate that the Six-Party Talks and inter-Korean relations are progressing in a mutually reinforcing manner. Significant progress was also made in the economic and trade area.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa05">The Gaeseong Industrial Complex, which is located in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and employs some 18,000 local workers, will be upgraded to accommodate further investments. The creation of an additional industrial complex in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is also being contemplated. To further economic development, the Gaeseong-Sinuiju railway, and the Gaeseong-Pyongyang expressway in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will be improved for common use by both Koreas.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa06">On the culture front, the two Koreas will cooperate closely at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa07">Through its various provisions, the Declaration points the way forward for common prosperity, eventual peaceful reunification in the Korean peninsula and the resolution of longstanding regional concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa08">The Republic of Korea firmly believes that the inter-Korean summit and the resulting Declaration are positive developments, not only for both Koreas, but also for the international community as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa09">It was exactly seven years ago today that the General Assembly adopted its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-11.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/11</a> under the same agenda item, welcoming and supporting the June 2000 inter-Korean summit and its joint declaration. I am confident that on this very special day Member States will once again demonstrate their support for advancing inter-Korean relations and peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula by adopting the draft resolution by consensus.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Salgueiro</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The candidate countries Turkey, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the countries of the European Free Trade Association Liechtenstein and Norway, the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia align themselves with this declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">The European Union is following with keen interest all efforts to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula. Accordingly, the EU supports any initiative conducive to the fostering of peace, stability and cooperation on the peninsula -- namely, the adoption of a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly on peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">The EU fully supported the summit between President Roh Moo-hyun and General Secretary Kim Jong Il, held in Pyongyang on 2 to 4 October, as well as the outcome of this summit -- the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity -- and considers that it has contributed to the reinforcement of a growing atmosphere of confidence and trust on the Korean peninsula. In turn, the EU believes that this atmosphere will contribute to efforts within the framework of the Six-Party Talks, a process fully supported by the EU, to achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">Furthermore, the European Union looks forward to the follow-up to this initiative, starting with the meeting between the Prime Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, which will take place in November. The EU stands ready to contribute to the process of inter-Korean dialogue, reconciliation and reunification, as called for in the draft resolution before us.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Liu Zhenmin</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to welcome the presence of the Secretary-General at this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">In October 2007, the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea held a second summit meeting and adopted the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. China welcomes this development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">Seven years ago, leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, with statesman-like vision, started North-South summit meetings, thus providing another important platform for the promotion of peace and reunification of the peninsula. This second summit between the two countries has indicated that the two sides have been working to seize this historic opportunity and start a new era of peace and prosperity for both nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">The meeting of the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea was in line with the trend towards peace, development and cooperation in the world in the common interests of the two countries, and conducive to peace on the peninsula and peace and stability in our region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">As a friendly neighbour of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, China attaches importance to maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and works towards that end. We have always advocated and supported the idea that the two sides on the peninsula should resolve their differences through dialogue, to advance the process of reconciliation continually and to achieve autonomous peace and reunification. China will, as always, work hard towards that goal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa06">Lastly, China supports the inclusion of the item of peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula on the agenda of the General Assembly this year, and we hope that the draft resolution proposed jointly by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea can be adopted as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hoang Chi Trung</span> <span class="nation">Viet Nam</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">My delegation is very pleased to take part in the debate on this important item on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">First and foremost, we wish to thank the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea for their joint efforts in introducing <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.4</a>, entitled "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula".</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">We are all very delighted to see the two Koreas working together in the interests of peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">The second summit meeting, held in Pyongyang from 2 to 4 October 2007 between the two leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Korea, and the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, which was adopted at the summit, are events of great historic significance. Viet Nam welcomes and highly appreciates the encouraging outcomes of these developments.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">My country is convinced that this represents an important milestone in the process of improving and developing relations between the two Koreas. We firmly believe that the implementation of the outcomes of the summit and the Declaration on relations between the two Koreas will particularly contribute to promoting reconciliation, cooperation and the maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region. It will also bring the Koreans closer to their long-held dreams of national reunification and prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">Viet Nam will always hope for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. We consistently support the settlement of the issues relating to the Korean peninsula through dialogue and peaceful negotiations. We share the intense aspirations for peace and national reunification felt by the peoples of the North and of the South on the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">Viet Nam has been following the developments on the Korean peninsula with keen interest. We urge the international community, and the United Nations in particular, to lend their strong support to the two Koreas in their efforts to give effect to the outcomes they have negotiated at the summit meeting, so that they can soon reach their common goals of national reconciliation and reunification.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">As a country that enjoys good relations with both Koreas, Viet Nam is willing to contribute actively and positively to the improvement of relations between the two, as well as to the peace process on the Korean peninsula. We believe enhanced peace and stability on the Korean peninsula will further the cause of peace and security in North-East Asia, as well as in the world as a whole.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Takasu</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">I would like to express Japan's strong support for the draft resolution on "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula" (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>). Japan welcomes the recent inter-Korean summit as a symbolic event demonstrating the deepening of dialogue between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We believe that the inter-Korean summit has contributed to further advancing inter-Korean relations, as well as to easing tension on the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Japan welcomes the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, which was signed at the inter-Korean summit. It underscores that the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have agreed to work together to implement smoothly the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005 and the 13 February 2007 agreement of the Six-Party Talks. We also welcome the commitment made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the outcome document of the Six-Party Talks issued on 3 October 2007, inter alia, to declare all nuclear programmes and to disable the three facilities at Yongbyon by the end of this year, as measures to be taken in the second phase for the implementation of the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">The denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is essential for the peace and stability of not only North-East Asia, but also of the entire international community. We consider it most important for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to implement these commitments fully. Japan continues to work actively towards a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue within the framework of the Six-Party Talks, with a view to comprehensively resolving outstanding issues, such as the abduction, nuclear and missile issues, settling the "unfortunate past" and realizing the normalization of relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, based on the Japan-Democratic People's Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">We sincerely hope that the adoption of the draft resolution will further promote the denuclearization process of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the resolution of other outstanding issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khalilzad</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">The United States is pleased to support the draft resolution on "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula" (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>), which recognizes that dialogue and cooperation between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are essential not only for better relations on the peninsula, but also to promote peace and stability in the region and beyond. The United States has consistently encouraged such a dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">We welcomed the historic inter-Korean summit that was held earlier this month and the Joint Declaration, adopted at that meeting, which outlines an ambitious agenda to improve relations and develop cooperative mechanisms on the Korean peninsula. We believe that this dialogue process is both supportive of and complementary to progress on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in the Six-Party talks.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">The Joint Statement of 19 September 2005 calls for the directly related parties to negotiate a permanent peace regime on the Korean peninsula at an appropriate separate forum, a goal which is also enunciated in the inter-Korean Joint Declaration. The United States believes these discussions could begin among the directly related parties once the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has disabled its existing nuclear facilities, has provided a complete and correct declaration of all of its nuclear programmes and is clearly on the road to complete denuclearization. We can achieve a permanent peace arrangement on the Korean peninsula once the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully discloses and abandons its nuclear weapons programme.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">The United States will continue to support efforts to build better relations between the countries of North-East Asia through the Six-Party Talks and other appropriate mechanisms. We hope that the implementation of both the inter-Korean Joint Declaration and the full implementation of the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005 will lead to better relations between the two Koreas, a transformed North-East Asia, and better lives for all the people of the Korean peninsula.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Banks</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">New Zealand welcomes the introduction of the joint resolution on "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>) to the United Nations General Assembly. This is an important record of the second inter-Korean summit and endorses its central objective of bringing peace and stability to the Korean peninsula and of laying a further foundation for eventual reunification.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The security situation on the Korean peninsula affects the entire region, including New Zealand. Therefore, New Zealand welcomed the successful completion of the second inter-Korean summit between the leaders of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The meeting between President Roh Moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong Il was a valuable contribution to international efforts to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula, and it provides an important platform for more detailed discussions on a range of important security and economic issues between the two sides.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">The summit builds on the recent momentum in the Six-Party Talks process and adds to an emerging atmosphere of reconciliation and open dialogue in the region, which we hope will lead to the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">New Zealand, along with the rest of the region, takes great interest in the inter-Korean dialogue, in the hope that it will serve to reinforce the growing environment of confidence and trust between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the wider international community. That is the spirit of the draft resolution to be adopted this afternoon, and we welcome it.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Alsaidi</span> <span class="nation">Yemen</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Let me start by congratulating the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the people of the Republic of Korea on the successful summit between their leaders, held during the first week of this month. The summit culminated in an agreement to build a permanent peace regime, to declare an end to the Korean war and to work for peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula. Most important, the leaders of both Koreas committed themselves to the establishment of peace and to the denuclearization of the peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Peace on the Korean peninsula is imperative for peaceful relations in North-East Asia, a vital region of the world. My country's sympathy with the aspirations of the Korean people is informed by its own experience as a divided country for more than 130 years. Yemen was reunified in May 1990. Constant conflict and turbulent relations, exacerbated by regional and global rivalries, had prevailed between the two parts of Yemen -- a situation that was akin to the experiences of other divided countries, including the Koreas.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The closure of borders was the rule, not the exception, notwithstanding the torments and sufferings of divided families. Moreover, the Yemen Arab Republic -- North Yemen -- and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen -- South Yemen -- were constantly mobilizing their scarce resources for intra-Yemeni confrontations, which were, unfortunately, recurrent. By doing so, each side tried to impose its will on the other, by virtue of what it believed to be the superiority of its political system. Consequently, economic development suffered; sadly, it was relegated to the back burner, as opposed to what the elite of each side thought to be their  raison d'être: unification of the country on their terms.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Many wars later, with precious resources having been wasted, reunification was finally realized. True, regional and global circumstances were conducive to the attainment of that noble objective. Meanwhile, a constitution for the prospective State was worked out in the interregnum between the many wars and the peace agreements. Its drafting took 10 years, and it is true that it was not without defects. But it was certainly an important step in a torturous and meandering journey towards peace between enemy brothers. It is also the case that reunified Yemen is not without difficulties; but what we have now is certainly far superior to the state of affairs that existed before 22 May 1990.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">With that in mind, my delegation wholeheartedly supports <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.4</a>. We encourage the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to fully and unreservedly implement the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, because it is a sine qua non for peace, prosperity and tranquillity in a vibrant region of world.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ney</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">Germany fully aligns itself with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Portugal on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Allow me to state that Germany, itself speaking from the perspective of a reunified country, is pleased with the course taken by the inter-Korean summit between President Roh Moo-hyun and General Secretary Kim Jong Il, held in Pyongyang from 2 to 4 October this year. We understand that there is reason to be optimistic. In the course of the summit meeting, both sides -- after some time -- managed to craft a perspective for a lasting and peaceful solution on the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">Germany attentively follows all efforts to decrease tensions on the Korean peninsula and looks upon the developments in that region with special sympathy. It is now, of course, up to the parties directly involved to create the conditions necessary for substantive negotiations on a peace treaty and to chart the course that will be followed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">We are fully aware that this noble cause cannot be achieved overnight and that it will depend on further progress within the framework of the Six-Party Talks. We also acknowledge that the situation on the Korean peninsula is quite different from that in which Germany found itself on the eve of unification. But what we have learned from our own experience is that the separation of a nation is not irreversible. The two Koreas will have to find their own way to tackle these issues, but Germany stands ready, upon request, to share its own experience from the years of German-German relations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">Germany is therefore delighted to support <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.4</a>, thereby welcoming the opportunities and prospects for real peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula as laid out in the summit's Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Natalegawa</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">As a country with close ties to both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, Indonesia has constantly supported the process of inter-Korean dialogue, reconciliation and reunification. As a South-East Asian nation, Indonesia consistently recognizes the tremendous contribution that peace and stability on the Korean peninsula could offer to the wider East Asian region.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang early this month and the adopted declaration constitute a major milestone in inter-Korean relations. We welcome these developments. We believe that any progress in inter-Korean relations has positive significance for peace and security in the Korean peninsula and in the wider region. In this regard, we expressed our full support for the inclusion of this additional item, "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula", in the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly, as we feel it incumbent upon the United Nations to welcome and encourage these developments.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">We support the joint initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to table <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.4</a> before the General Assembly. We believe that the Assembly should encourage the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to implement the declaration fully and in good faith and invite Member States to continue to support and assist, as appropriate, the process of inter-Korean dialogue, reconciliation and reunification.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">It is our sincere hope that the draft resolution will enjoy unanimous support from Member States and will be adopted by the Assembly without a vote.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pankrasin</span> <span class="nation">Thailand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">First of all, let me join other delegates in praising the fruitful outcome of the summit meeting held in Pyongyang early this month.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">That high-level meeting contributed to consolidating peace on the Korean peninsula as the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea explored ways to increase mutual trust through political and military confidence-building measures, as well as ways to lay the groundwork for an eventual inter-Korean economic community. The success of this recent meeting not only reflects the strong desire of both sides to jointly promote cooperation and national reconciliation, but also marks progress towards peaceful reunification.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">The Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, agreed by the two leaders on 4 October, represents a solemn commitment in improving inter-Korean relations. Thailand wishes both sides success in implementing the Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">For a long period of time, the Korean peninsula has been a hot spot in North-East Asia and the globe as a whole. Since 1950, the tense situation of confrontation between the North and the South had been a cause of concern for peace and security in the Korean peninsula and in the North-East Asian region. The recent developments in relations between North and South have created a favourable environment and conditions for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula; this deserves universal praise from the global community at large.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Thailand stands ready to cooperate with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea as they work to implement fully the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">In this connection, Thailand is pleased to support the draft resolution introduced by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>) on "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula".</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">The delegation of Belarus would like to welcome the draft resolution entitled "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula" (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>), which was prepared jointly by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The agreements that were reached between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea at the Pyongyang summit a few weeks ago were not only a basis for the preparation of this draft resolution; they also mark an important milestone in improving inter-Korean relations and consolidating peace on the Korean peninsula, as well as in the North-East Asian region.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">We note the adoption in Pyongyang of the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, which is an important stage in reconciling the two countries and in ensuring the peaceful reunification of the Korean people.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea have shown us all a very eloquent example of the fact that even the most complex and sensitive issues in relations between States can be resolved at the negotiating table. Goodwill, diplomacy, cooperation and a readiness to hear the other side, as opposed to confrontation, sanctions and threats -- these are the guarantees of enhanced peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Belarus is very pleased at this opportunity to support the peace-loving efforts of both countries, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, and we call on all delegations to support <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.4</a>.</p>

Our country has consistently called for dialogue and normalization of relations between the north and south of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">As a close neighbour enjoying friendly relations with both Koreas, Russia welcomes the second inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang, which culminated in the signing of a joint Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity by the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. We certainly wish the greatest success for this agreement. We are ready to continue supporting any initiatives, including within the context of the draft resolution before us today, which aim at consolidating peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia as a whole.</p>

We commend both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for their renewed efforts towards peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa02">Canada is encouraged by the summit meeting held in Pyongyang earlier this month, a welcome step that can only enhance understanding between the two parties. We expect that this will contribute towards greater inter-Korean economic cooperation and the reduction of military tension, as well as to the realization of the Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification of the peninsula and greater stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa03">Canada encourages both sides to continue these efforts in good faith in order to implement fully the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. It is only through continued mutual effort that the common goals of peace and prosperity can be reached and that the foundation for peaceful reunification can be properly laid.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa04">Canada also hopes that this summit will reinforce the positive developments in the Six-Party Talks and help to advance efforts toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. A peaceful, prosperous Korean peninsula is in the interests not only of the region, but also of the entire international community. Canada stands ready to help in the achievement of these important goals.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa01">Guatemala firmly supports the draft resolution on peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>) submitted jointly by the two countries and we are pleased to reiterate our support, as we did for <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-11.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/11</a> of 31 October 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa02">We were pleased to see the outcome of the summit held by the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea held in Pyongyang from 2 to 4 October 2007 and the joint Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, which represents a major milestone in improving communication and understanding between the two Koreas. We hope that the cooperation that led to the summit and its follow-up will ultimately lead to reconciliation on the peninsula and better security in the region, in accordance with the purposes and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa03">It is in that spirit that Guatemala has made its contribution to enhancing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. On the one hand, we greatly value our long-standing bilateral relationship with the Republic of Korea, with which we have succeeded in developing trade, cultural and investment links, as well as official cooperation links. On the other hand, Guatemala and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea established diplomatic relations in September 2007 and our two countries will soon appoint non-resident ambassadors.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa04">The Korean peninsula has been an area of great tension and a source of great concern for the entire international community. We welcome with satisfaction all efforts to foster confidence and deal with whatever questions remain to be solved. Guatemala hopes that the rapprochement between the two Koreas will continue to bear fruit, and we would like to encourage the continuation of the policy that both Governments have been carrying out.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa05">Along those same lines, <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.4</a> contains a clear message from the international community of the nations represented in the United Nations for both States to continue to work on the process, applying the joint Declaration in good faith along with the other agreements arrived at by both parties, as well as all other measures that will lead to peacebuilding on the Korean peninsula and which will set solid foundations for a peaceful reunification.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa06">We would also like to encourage Member States to support inter-Korean dialogue, reconciliation and reunification by providing whatever assistance may be required. We trust that the General Assembly will adopt the draft resolution by consensus.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Chile is a country in the Pacific Basin, and thus we view with great hope the efforts made by two sister peoples for peace, reconciliation and reunification. They are countries of the Asian Pacific, sharing one language, one past and one destiny -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. The Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity that resulted from the Pyongyang summit is the outcome of a difficult and sensitive process by two States that are committed to reversing a history of struggle and grief. Those efforts have been a challenge to the political will of both countries and represent a promise for the future of the people of the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">In the draft resolution submitted to the Assembly by the two Koreas (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>) the international community bolsters those efforts and provides a global political context in which to continue the diplomatic initiatives already begun, including the Six-Party Talks and full implementation of the Beijing agreement of 13 February 2007, which will lead to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the re-establishment of a climate of trust in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">In 1996 our country was invited to become a member of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, one of many initiatives aimed at promoting peace and development on the Korean peninsula. We did so because of our commitment to peace and international security, by which we understand that no State, no matter what its economic standing or geographical location are, should fail to join in that noble effort to benefit the entire region and the world. Since then, our relations with the Korean people have improved and deepened. In fact, the first free trade treaty negotiated by the Republic of Korea exists between Chile and the Republic of Korea. We view the Korean peninsula and Korean culture as examples of tenacity, dignity and creative genius.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">In voting in favour of the draft resolution, we are also extending our best wishes to the people of the two States, which, we hope, will sooner or later become the one nation that is certainly yearned for by the entire population of that great nation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Towpik</span> <span class="nation">Poland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa01">Poland fully supports the statement made by the representative of Portugal on behalf of the European Union. Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to make some additional comments. For many years, Poland has been engaged in the stabilization efforts in the region, as well as in the process of reconciliation between the two Korean States. Since 1953 -- that means for more than 50 years -- we have been continuously participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa02">Support for peace and security in the region has always been at the heart of Polish foreign policy, and that is why Poland sincerely welcomes and supports the draft resolution entitled "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula" (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>). The fact that the resolution has been prepared and tabled jointly by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea has a particular, unprecedented and in fact historical significance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa03">The draft resolution and recent developments, such as the agreement reached in the framework of the Six-Party Talks, the inter-Korean summit and the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, raise prospects for real progress on the Korean peninsula. We strongly encourage the two Korean States to maintain this unique momentum and to fully implement recent multilateral and bilateral Korean agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa04">We hope that, after more than half a century of division, conflicts and tension, the two sides can establish mutual trust and strong inter-Korean relations to ensure peace and stability in the region, where the Korean people will be able to enjoy better lives.</p>

Mongolia is heartened by the outcome of the second inter-Korean summit, held in early October, which resulted in the adoption of the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity. Full and faithful implementation of the Declaration will be crucial in improving inter-Korean relations, consolidating peace on the Korean peninsula and laying a solid foundation for peaceful reunification.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa02">As a North-East Asian nation with internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free status, Mongolia is pleased with the recent progress achieved in the Six-Party Talks on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. In that regard, we welcome the agreement for the implementation of the second-phase steps and look forward to a speedy realization.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa03">As its contribution towards advancing the Six-Party Talks, Mongolia hosted a bilateral working group session on the normalization of relations between Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in September this year and stands ready to continue such efforts in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa04">In light of the promising political dynamics in the subregion, Mongolia is optimistic that its early call for a multilateral security cooperation mechanism in North-East Asia will gain further support in the subregion and beyond.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wai</span> <span class="nation">Myanmar</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk05-pa01">The delegation of Myanmar extends its full support to <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.4</a> entitled "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula". The draft resolution tabled jointly by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea is unique and commendable. My delegation congratulates the two sides on the success of their joint effort.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk05-pa02">The summit meeting between the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea held in Pyongyang a few weeks ago and the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity are truly milestones in inter-Korean relations. Every effort towards peace is a welcome step. My delegation attaches great importance to the issue of the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. Recent developments will further contribute to the cause of peace and security in North-East Asia and beyond.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk05-pa03">Myanmar enjoys cordial, friendly relations with both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea and therefore fully supports the endeavours of the leaders of the two countries for peaceful reunification.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk05-pa04">Myanmar views the recent developments on the Korean peninsula as a major step towards peace and prosperity for the people of Korea. The recent steps are in conformity with Myanmar's world view, which supports every effort to ensure world peace. Myanmar looks forward to seeing further developments in that respect and will continue to lend its support to all of the parties concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk05-pa05">My delegation is fully confident that the draft resolution will be adopted by the General Assembly by consensus.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zinsou</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like once again voice its appreciation to you, Sir, for the clear-sightedness with which you have been leading the work of the sixty-second session.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">I wish to refer to the question of the peaceful reunification of Korea. My country, the Republic of Benin, has friendly relations with the two sister republics on the Korean peninsula. For a number of decades, Benin has been working to promote the peaceful reunification of the peninsula, because we are convinced that such reunification would lead to considerable improvement in the situation in the entire region in the political, economic and social spheres. Thus, the Government of Benin welcomes a reunification that would put an end to one of the most painful relics of the divisions caused by the Second World War.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">For that reason my delegation is pleased to note the specific measures -- constructive measures -- taken by the two Korean leaders during these past months. We welcome, in particular, the success of the most recent inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang at the beginning of October, and we are pleased at the opening of new prospects for dialogue between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as is to be understood from the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity adopted by both leaders on 4 October 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">The Government of Benin strongly urges both countries to show each other increasing goodwill in stepping up and broadening the movement to overcome the obstacles between the two countries. The joyful accomplishment of that task will permit the Korean people to enjoy the benefits of peace, security and stability on all levels.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">My delegation believes that the adoption of the draft resolution before the General Assembly (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>) will make it possible to bring the endorsement of the United Nations to a process that has already been started by both countries and will give new impetus to the efforts of the international community to help the Korean people as a whole to overcome the tragic division. It is an approach that should be facilitated by the fact that it is supported by the consensus presently obtained between the two countries on the question. In other words, my delegation fully supports the draft resolution and calls on the General Assembly to adopt it as such.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tarragô</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I would like to add my voice to those of previous speakers in welcoming the draft resolution introduced by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea entitled "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula" (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>). It is a most welcome initiative as it follows the landmark event of the second inter-Korean summit, held in early October in Pyongyang, during which the two Korean leaders reaffirmed the commitment of their respective Governments and peoples to dialogue, cooperation, prosperity and eventual reunification. The Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity is a major step forward to bringing inter-Korean relations to a higher stage of cooperation and understanding. The inter-Korean dialogue and the joint Korean initiatives on the issue in the General Assembly are evidence that this ongoing process of normalization on the peninsula is to be led first and foremost by the Korean people themselves with our support.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">In this spirit, following the first inter-Korean summit in the year 2000, Brazil co-signed the request for the inclusion of an additional agenda item of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly and was a sponsor of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-11.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/11</a>. We believe the General Assembly's adoption, by acclamation, of the draft resolution now before us (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>) will once again demonstrate the international community's keen interest in a peaceful, secure, developed and reunified Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">Brazil considers that a unanimously adopted resolution of the General Assembly will give renewed impetus to the continuation and strengthening of the inter-Korean dialogue and to the promotion of sustainable peace and security on the Korean peninsula, as well as in North-East Asia and beyond.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mantovani</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I should like to add a few remarks to the statement made by the European Union presidency, to which Italy fully aligns itself.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Italy has hailed the recent inter-Korean summit as a key step towards peace, stability, cooperation and eventual reunification on the peninsula. Its positive outcome is all the more gratifying for our country, as Italy, has constantly promoted the inter-Korean dialogue, even at the most difficult stages.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 2000, Italy has hosted, in cooperation with scientific organizations, a number of seminars on stability and peace on the peninsula, to which both countries have actively participated. Moreover, Italy has been one of the major contributors to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization over the years.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">Combined with the encouraging progress towards denuclearization, within the framework of the Six-Party Talks, the inter-Korean dialogue is creating the conditions for increased cooperation and stability on the peninsula and in the wider region. This is a strategic process that all Member States and relevant international organizations should support, as called for in the draft resolution before us (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>). Italy is ready to play its part, including by increasing its assistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the humanitarian, health, education and cultural sectors as announced by Deputy Foreign Minister Vernetti in his recent visit to the peninsula just before the summit.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">Finally, we are particularly pleased that the General Assembly has been able to address, in a timely and consensual manner, such a topical issue. We believe that through initiatives like this one, the General Assembly reaffirms its relevance and its ability to meaningfully react to key international developments. That is the most effective way to pursue the objective of a revitalized and reinvigorated General Assembly, which has constantly been a priority for our delegation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Islam</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Bangladesh welcomes the introduction of the draft resolution entitled "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula" (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.4.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.4</a>). We also welcome the historic second inter-Korean summit, held from 2 to 4 October in Pyongyang.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">Bangladesh strongly believes that constructive dialogue is the best way to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula. In that context, the second inter-Korean summit is an important milestone in the process of improvement and development of relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. We envisage that this advancement would finally result in a unified Korean in the near future. That is not only the long-held dream, but also the desire of the world community.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">The United Nations should render all possible support to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea in their joint effort to materialize the outcomes of the second inter-Korean summit meeting. As a country that considers itself a friend of both Koreas, Bangladesh is willing to contribute actively and positively to the peace process on the Korean peninsula. We hope that this draft resolution will be adopted by consensus.</p>

Also, my delegation would like to express Egypt's support of the content and thrust of the draft resolution which stresses the importance of promoting dialogue between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, in the interest of strengthening security on the Korean peninsula. That contributes to the stability of the North-East Asia region and actively embodies the efforts to implement United Nations principles and purposes for the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk03-pa02">There is no doubt that dialogue and serious negotiations among all parties concerned are the best means to positively address all issues in dispute. In this context, the delegation of Egypt welcomes the declaration issued on 4 October following the summit of the two Koreas on enhancing relations between them. Also, we support the goals and incentives of the declaration, which forms a solid foundation for achieving constructive steps towards rapprochement and reconciliation between the two countries so that eventually they will be peacefully reunified. That would enhance regional stability and peace as well as global security, which is a common goal for all of us.</p>

We believe that it clearly shows the positive results that can be obtained through dialogue and cooperation. Inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation are paramount for consolidating peace and security on the Korean peninsula and, also, to contributing to peace and stability in the region, as well as at the international level. Cuba has supported and continues to support the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">For this reason, my country welcomed the inter-Korean summit held from 2 to 4 October 2007 and the Declaration on the Advancement of North-South Korean Relations, Peace and Prosperity, adopted on 4 October as an outcome of the summit. We are pleased at the determination stated by both parties fully to implement the Declaration, as part of the process towards peaceful reunification.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">During the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit Conference held last year in Havana, heads of State or Government stressed the importance of guaranteeing durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula for the sake of the common prosperity of the Korean people, as well as for the peace and security of North-East Asia and the rest of the world. Likewise, the NAM Summit expressed its support towards efforts to reunify the Korean peninsula based on the legitimate aspirations and concerted efforts of the Korean peoples themselves as stated in the joint declaration issued on 15 June 2000 at the historic North-South summit held in Pyongyang.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">As in the past, Cuba will continue to fully support the process of inter-Korean dialogue, reconciliation and reunification.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa01">I give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa02">The Secretary-General: Allow me to welcome the General Assembly's adoption by consensus of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-5.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 62/5</a>, entitled "Peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula". I offer my sincere congratulations to the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa03">Today's date coincides exactly with the date seven years ago when the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-11.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/11</a> following the June 2000 summit of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. I welcome that coincidence. In my homeland of Korea, it is an ancient custom to choose an auspicious day for any celebration or new endeavour. Inevitably, I also look back on the preparations for the 2000 summit and on its follow-up, in which I was personally involved as Vice-Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa04">Today, as the Secretary-General, I feel a much more personal obligation to do all I can to encourage and facilitate the continuing work for peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula. I am convinced that the historic inter-Korean summit will pave the way for a permanent peace regime and eventual reunification. It will lead to increased inter-Korean reconciliation, cooperation and shared prosperity. I also believe it will act as a catalyst for continued progress in the Six-Party Talks on the denuclearization of the peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa05">Once again, I commend the wisdom and courage of Chairman Kim Jong Il and President Roh Moo-hyun in seizing the momentum and taking this significant step forward. I also thank the General Assembly for its unanimous support for this resolution, which attests to the aspiration of the international community for peace and stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa06">It will now be of the utmost importance to implement fully the outcome of the summit. Every step in carrying out the agreed elements of the declaration will be an important measure for confidence-building on the peninsula. I encourage the leaders of both Koreas to maintain the momentum created by this historic turn of history. And I encourage all Member States -- in particular those engaged in the Six-Party Talks -- to lend their valuable support in sustaining a favourable atmosphere and assisting in the implementation of the outcome. As Secretary-General, I stand ready to provide every assistance required, in close cooperation with the international community.</p>

Ms. Grossman has been with the United Nations for 34 years, for the majority of which she has been associated with the work of the plenary of the General Assembly. Her contribution to the smooth running of the meetings of the Assembly has been truly significant, and I would like the Assembly to give her a round of applause in appreciation. We wish Ms. Grossman all the best.</p>
