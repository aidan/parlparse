	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">On behalf of the General Assembly, I request the representative of the Niger to convey our condolences to the Government and the people of the Niger and to the bereaved family of His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara.</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">A painful event occurred on Friday, 9 April 1999, with the tragic death of President Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara. I am deeply touched by the tribute that has just been paid to his memory by the General Assembly and I thank you, Sir, on behalf of the Government and the people of the Niger.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">As the Assembly is aware, following the tragic passing of the President of the Republic, the Niger armed forces, in a burst of national spirit, decided to take the reins of power by establishing a Council of National Reconciliation. This new presence of the army on my country's political scene was intended to spare the Niger and its people the major repercussions of the political stalemate towards which they had been inexorably headed. I therefore wish to express here the adherence of the entire population of the Niger, the political class and civil society to this new beginning for the reconciliation of our hearts and minds.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa03">I can also confirm the full resolve of the Council of National Reconciliation and its firm commitment to observing a transitional period of nine months in order to lay the lasting foundations of a genuine and irreversible return to democracy in the Niger. This transition is headed by a Government of broad-based national unity established on 16 April 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa04">The objectives of the new authorities in the Niger are to pursue the democratic process, to restore civilian government on 1 January 2000 and to respect fundamental freedoms, human rights and the international commitments already undertaken by my country. The plan for a return to normal constitutional life has been established as follows: adoption of the constitution by referendum in June 1999; legislative and presidential elections in November 1999; and inauguration of the President Elect on 31 December 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa05">Every provision has already been made for the establishment of a body entrusted with drafting the basic texts of the Republic: the constitution and the electoral code. I also wish to draw attention to the decision of the Council of National Reconciliation on the ineligibility of its members and those of the Government and the defence and security forces in elections during the transition period.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa06">At this difficult time, I solemnly appeal to all the Niger's partners and friends to provide my country with all the support it needs to make the transition set down by the Council of National Reconciliation a success.</p>
