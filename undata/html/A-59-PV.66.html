<p><b>The Acting President</b>: Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote.

<p>May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited, strictly, to 10 minutes.

<p>The Assembly will now take a decision on the draft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 8 of its report. The draft resolution is entitled "Estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other political initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and/or the Security Council: United Nations advance team in the Sudan".</p>
<p>The Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the same.</p>

<p><b>The Acting President</b>: The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 108.</p>
	<blockquote indent="36"><b>Reports of the First Committee</b></blockquote>
<p><b>The Acting President</b>: The General Assembly will now consider the reports of the First Committee on agenda items 57 to 72. I request the Rapporteur of the First Committee, Mr. Mohamed Ali Saleh Alnajar of Yemen, to introduce the reports of the First Committee in one intervention.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Alnajar</b> (Yemen), Rapporteur of the First Committee (<i>spoke in Arabic</i>): It is a pleasure for me to introduce the reports of the First Committee to the General Assembly. They are contained in documents <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/451">A/59/451</a> to <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/466">A/59/466</a>. In keeping with the request of the General Assembly, the First Committee was able to complete its work within the five weeks allotted to it during this year's session. There were 23 formal meetings, and the work of the Committee was substantive, constructive and action-oriented. Fifty- four draft resolutions and three draft decisions were introduced on disarmament agenda items under consideration by the Committee. Two draft resolutions (A/C.1/59/L.1 and L.13), on improving the effectiveness of the methods of work of the First Committee, were withdrawn. Of the 54 draft resolutions and three draft decisions, 34 draft resolutions and two draft decisions -- 65 per cent of the total -- were adopted without a vote.</p>
<p>As in previous sessions, the Committee gave priority to items relating to weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, and to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Eighteen of the 54 draft resolutions pertain to nuclear issues.</p>
<p>Because of the impact that the threat of terrorism has had on the international scene, the way in which we look at questions of disarmament has changed. Disarmament and related issues were discussed with greater urgency and with an unprecedented degree of cooperation throughout the session. Members considered all matters relating to peace and disarmament and, indeed, discussed disarmament issues relating to weapons of all kinds, from weapons of mass destruction to small arms and light weapons. Delegations welcomed progress in the non- proliferation of both nuclear weapons and conventional weapons, including small arms and light weapons.</p>
<p>At the same time, members highlighted the threat posed by existing arsenals of nuclear and conventional weapons. This did not prevent members from reviewing their positions on peace and disarmament issues, but it gave impetus to efforts to take substantive and urgent disarmament measures. That trend was apparent when the Committee considered nuclear disarmament. It was stressed that nuclear non- proliferation and disarmament must be a priority for the future. Here, delegations stressed the need for further bilateral and multilateral nuclear arms- reduction efforts.</p>
<p>Delegations observed that, while we look forward with hope to the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), we must revisit nuclear disarmament in order to develop new methods, approaches and military and strategic theories. Consideration was also given to ways to prevent such arms from falling into the hands of terrorists and other non-State actors. It was observed that further steps are needed leading to total nuclear disarmament, and a number of draft resolutions may be seen in that context. These include texts relating to nuclear- weapon-free zones in Central Asia and in the Middle East, to consolidating the regime established by the Treaty of Tlatelolco and to establishing a nuclear- weapon-free southern hemisphere. All of this was seen as a step towards a nuclear-weapon-free world. Members urged implementation of conventions on nuclear waste.</p>
<p>Many delegations expressed despair at the failure of the Conference on Disarmament to discuss key substantive issues during its 2004 session. There was a need for further negotiations during the session to reach viable arrangements and to draft instruments on these issues. Members also affirmed that all issues regarding this year's deadlock will be reviewed so that the Conference can establish an ad hoc committee to begin negotiations on weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>There was support for initiatives on the implementation of the Convention on Chemical Weapons. Delegations also welcomed the annual Meetings of the States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention leading up to the sixth Review Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty, at which, inter alia, issues of verification will be discussed.</p>
<p>Although regional disarmament retains its conventional focus, the issue has taken on a new dimension that requires firm and urgent action. I refer here to the question of small arms and light weapons. The draft resolution on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons (draft resolution XXI in document <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/459">A/59/459</a>) received broad support; it emphasizes the importance of the full implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects adopted by the United Nations Conference on that subject.</p>
<p>Allow me, before concluding my comments on substantive issues, to briefly mention the question of improving the effectiveness of the methods of work of the First Committee. As I have noted, the First Committee considered and adopted by consensus a draft resolution (draft resolution XXX of document <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/459">A/59/459</a>) sponsored by 106 States on that item. Major challenges to the international community demand a new, more dynamic approach. In addition, it has become clear that international threats cannot be countered without a unified effort by all States. Such efforts could be promoted by the biennialization or triennialization of certain items and by clustering similar draft resolutions. The Committee also decided to reduce the number of its draft resolutions and emphasized the need for a new approach.</p>
<p>I would like to make a correction to draft resolution IV in document <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/459">A/59/459</a>. The penultimate preambular paragraph should begin with the words "Being concerned".</p>
<p>Before concluding, I would like to commend delegations for their cooperation, their active contribution to the work of the Committee and their efforts to build a more peaceful and stable world. I would like especially to thank Ambassador Alfonso De Alba, Chairman of the First Committee, who guided its work with great insight, diplomatic skill and ability, based on his expertise in issues of disarmament and international peace and security. On behalf of the Committee and on my own account, I would like also to thank the Vice-Chairs for their very effective and efficient cooperation in the work of the Committee and especially in the various working groups that met during formal and informal consultations.</p>
<p>I would further like to thank Mr. Nobuyasu Abe, Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, and Mr. Chen Jian, Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management, who provided invaluable and effective assistance to the First Committee. I would like especially to thank the Secretary of the First Committee, Ms. Cheryl Stoute, who shared her expertise and abilities with us, enabling the work of the Committee to be crowned with success. This also enabled consensus to prevail in the First Committee, something that is becoming ever rarer. My thanks go also to Mr. Sergei Cherniavsky, Mr. Tam Chung and all the other members of the Secretariat who provided their valuable support to the Committee.</p>
<p>With those introductory comments, I commend the draft resolutions and draft decisions recommended in documents <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/451">A/59/451</a> to <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/466">A/59/466</a> for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>
<p><b>The Acting President</b>: If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the First Committee which are before the Assembly today.</p>
	<blockquote indent="36"><i>It was so decided.</i></blockquote>
<p><b>The Acting President</b>: Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote. Positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the First Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records. May I remind members that under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that when the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, that is either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee.</p>
<p>May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with decision 34/401, explanations of vote are strictly limited to 10 minutes, and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
<p>Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the First Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the First Committee, unless notified otherwise in advance. This means that where recorded or separate votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the First Committee.</p>

<p><b>The Acting President</b>: May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 64?</p>

<p><b>Agenda item 65</b></p>
<p><b>General and complete disarmament</b></p>
	<blockquote indent="35"><b>Report of the First Committee (<a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/459">A/59/459</a>)</b></blockquote>
<p><b>The Acting President</b>: The Assembly has before it 30 draft resolutions recommended by the First Committee in paragraph 90 of its report and three draft decisions recommended by the Committee in paragraph 91 of the same report.</p>
<p>I give the floor to the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, who wishes to make statement in explanation of vote before the voting.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Kim </b>Chang Guk (Democratic People's Republic of Korea): I should like to speak in explanation of vote on draft resolution A/C.1/59/L.50, entitled "The Hague Code of Conduct against ballistic missile proliferation".</p>
<p>My delegation understands that the missile proliferation issue is being used to obstruct the development and the positioning of missiles by certain developing countries, particularly those countries that the United States and its allies detest. Those that have most of the missiles in the world are none other than the United States and its allies. They are developing new types of missiles, deploying them abroad and selling them to other countries.</p>
<p>The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in dealing with the missile issue, always refers to the political and military situation that has been created on the Korean peninsula. The United States and its allies in the region have deployed numerous nuclear missiles around the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, blockading it militarily and threatening a pre-emptive strike against it. In these circumstances, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has no interest in any debate which may negatively affect the development, production and deployment of missiles for its self-defence.</p>
<p>The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is concerned at the use, under the pretext of non- proliferation, of double standards with respect to the efforts of the developing countries to strengthen their self-defence forces and to develop space technology. However, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, out of respect for the idea of the draft resolution, will not participate in the voting.</p>
<p><b>The Acting President</b>: I give the floor to the representative of the Philippines on a point of order.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Gatan </b>(Philippines): I wish to speak on a point of order because, although the Philippine delegation co-sponsored draft resolution <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/L.50">A/59/L.50</a>, the Philippines is not included in the list of sponsors. Apparently there has been an inadvertent omission. We would like to rectify this situation by formally announcing and requesting that it be place on record that the Philippines is co-sponsoring draft resolution <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/L.50">A/59/L.50</a>.</p>
	<blockquote indent="36"><b>The Acting President</b>: That will be attended to.</blockquote>
<p>The Assembly will now take a decision on the 30 draft resolutions and the three draft decisions, one by one.</p>
<p>After all the decisions have been taken, representatives will again have the opportunity to explain their vote.</p>
<p>Will delegations please turn to paragraph 90 of section III concerning the draft resolutions.</p>
<p>We turn first to draft resolution I, entitled "National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology".</p>
<p>The First Committee adopted draft resolution I without a vote. May I take that the Assembly wishes to do the same?</p>
	<blockquote indent="36"><i>Draft resolution I was adopted</i> (<a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/RES/59/66">resolution 59/66</a>).</blockquote>

<p><b>Mr. Alnajar</b> (Yemen) (<i>spoke in Arabic</i>): Our delegation shares the concerns of the delegations that voted in favour of draft resolution XXVI, entitled "The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation".

<p>Our delegation does not oppose <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/RES/59/91">resolution 59/91</a> on the Hague Code of Conduct. My country attaches particular importance to the Code and is continuing to study it in depth.

<p><b>The Acting President</b>: I call on the representative of Canada to speak in explanation of vote on the resolution just adopted.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Laurin</b> (Canada): I have taken the floor to explain Canada's vote in favour of the resolution entitled "The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East". It is important for Canada to ensure that our position is not misunderstood or misrepresented, and we would be vigilant in that regard.</p>
<p>In April 2004, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1540 (2004) on the non- proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Resolution 1540 (2004) calls on all States</p>
	<blockquote indent="36">"to promote the universal adoption and full implementation, and, where necessary, strengthening of multilateral treaties to which they are parties, whose aim is to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons". (<i>para. 8 (a</i>))</blockquote>
<p>Canada, an original signatory and State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), voted in favour of today's resolution in due consideration of a number of factors, not the least of which is stipulated in resolution 1540 (2004), which I have just quoted. Canada has judged today's resolution on its merit and determined that it is entirely consistent with Canada's long-standing nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation policy. The resolution is firmly grounded in the consensus achieved by NPT States parties and reflected in the Final Document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. Our vote in favour of the resolution was announced in the Canadian statement to the plenary of the General Assembly in the debate on agenda item 37, "Question of Palestine", on 30 November.</p>
<p>Canada urges Israel, in the crucial months leading up to the 2005 NPT Review Conference, to take the necessary first steps to adhere to the NPT as a non- nuclear-weapon State. Canada further calls on all States in the Middle East region to comply fully with their NPT obligations and, in that regard, urges all States in the region that have not yet done so to sign and fully implement safeguard agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
