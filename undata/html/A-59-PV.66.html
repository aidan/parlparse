	<div class="p">The General Assembly will now consider the reports of the First Committee on agenda items 57 to 72. I request the Rapporteur of the First Committee, Mr. Mohamed Ali Saleh Alnajar of Yemen, to introduce the reports of the First Committee in one intervention.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="2-1">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Alnajar" nation="Yemen" language="">
	Mr. Alnajar (Yemen)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It is a pleasure for me to introduce the reports of the First Committee to the General Assembly. They are contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A/59/451">A/59/451</a> to <a href="../pdf/A/59/466">A/59/466</a>. In keeping with the request of the General Assembly, the First Committee was able to complete its work within the five weeks allotted to it during this year's session. There were 23 formal meetings, and the work of the Committee was substantive, constructive and action-oriented. Fifty-four draft resolutions and three draft decisions were introduced on disarmament agenda items under consideration by the Committee. Two draft resolutions (A/C.1/59/L.1 and L.13), on improving the effectiveness of the methods of work of the First Committee, were withdrawn. Of the 54 draft resolutions and three draft decisions, 34 draft resolutions and two draft decisions -- 65 per cent of the total -- were adopted without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">As in previous sessions, the Committee gave priority to items relating to weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, and to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Eighteen of the 54 draft resolutions pertain to nuclear issues.</div>
	<div class="p">Because of the impact that the threat of terrorism has had on the international scene, the way in which we look at questions of disarmament has changed. Disarmament and related issues were discussed with greater urgency and with an unprecedented degree of cooperation throughout the session. Members considered all matters relating to peace and disarmament and, indeed, discussed disarmament issues relating to weapons of all kinds, from weapons of mass destruction to small arms and light weapons. Delegations welcomed progress in the non-proliferation of both nuclear weapons and conventional weapons, including small arms and light weapons.</div>
	<div class="p">At the same time, members highlighted the threat posed by existing arsenals of nuclear and conventional weapons. This did not prevent members from reviewing their positions on peace and disarmament issues, but it gave impetus to efforts to take substantive and urgent disarmament measures. That trend was apparent when the Committee considered nuclear disarmament. It was stressed that nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament must be a priority for the future. Here, delegations stressed the need for further bilateral and multilateral nuclear arms-reduction efforts.</div>
	<div class="p">Delegations observed that, while we look forward with hope to the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), we must revisit nuclear disarmament in order to develop new methods, approaches and military and strategic theories. Consideration was also given to ways to prevent such arms from falling into the hands of terrorists and other non-State actors. It was observed that further steps are needed leading to total nuclear disarmament, and a number of draft resolutions may be seen in that context. These include texts relating to nuclear-weapon-free zones in Central Asia and in the Middle East, to consolidating the regime established by the Treaty of Tlatelolco and to establishing a nuclear-weapon-free southern hemisphere. All of this was seen as a step towards a nuclear-weapon-free world. Members urged implementation of conventions on nuclear waste.</div>
	<div class="p">Many delegations expressed despair at the failure of the Conference on Disarmament to discuss key substantive issues during its 2004 session. There was a need for further negotiations during the session to reach viable arrangements and to draft instruments on these issues. Members also affirmed that all issues regarding this year's deadlock will be reviewed so that the Conference can establish an ad hoc committee to begin negotiations on weapons of mass destruction.</div>
	<div class="p">There was support for initiatives on the implementation of the Convention on Chemical Weapons. Delegations also welcomed the annual Meetings of the States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention leading up to the sixth Review Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty, at which, inter alia, issues of verification will be discussed.</div>
	<div class="p">Although regional disarmament retains its conventional focus, the issue has taken on a new dimension that requires firm and urgent action. I refer here to the question of small arms and light weapons. The draft resolution on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons (draft resolution XXI in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/459">A/59/459</a>) received broad support; it emphasizes the importance of the full implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects adopted by the United Nations Conference on that subject.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me, before concluding my comments on substantive issues, to briefly mention the question of improving the effectiveness of the methods of work of the First Committee. As I have noted, the First Committee considered and adopted by consensus a draft resolution (draft resolution XXX of document <a href="../pdf/A/59/459">A/59/459</a>) sponsored by 106 States on that item. Major challenges to the international community demand a new, more dynamic approach. In addition, it has become clear that international threats cannot be countered without a unified effort by all States. Such efforts could be promoted by the biennialization or triennialization of certain items and by clustering similar draft resolutions. The Committee also decided to reduce the number of its draft resolutions and emphasized the need for a new approach.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to make a correction to draft resolution IV in document <a href="../pdf/A/59/459">A/59/459</a>. The penultimate preambular paragraph should begin with the words "Being concerned".</div>
	<div class="p">Before concluding, I would like to commend delegations for their cooperation, their active contribution to the work of the Committee and their efforts to build a more peaceful and stable world. I would like especially to thank Ambassador Alfonso De Alba, Chairman of the First Committee, who guided its work with great insight, diplomatic skill and ability, based on his expertise in issues of disarmament and international peace and security. On behalf of the Committee and on my own account, I would like also to thank the Vice-Chairs for their very effective and efficient cooperation in the work of the Committee and especially in the various working groups that met during formal and informal consultations.</div>
	<div class="p">I would further like to thank Mr. Nobuyasu Abe, Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, and Mr. Chen Jian, Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management, who provided invaluable and effective assistance to the First Committee. I would like especially to thank the Secretary of the First Committee, Ms. Cheryl Stoute, who shared her expertise and abilities with us, enabling the work of the Committee to be crowned with success. This also enabled consensus to prevail in the First Committee, something that is becoming ever rarer. My thanks go also to Mr. Sergei Cherniavsky, Mr. Tam Chung and all the other members of the Secretariat who provided their valuable support to the Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">With those introductory comments, I commend the draft resolutions and draft decisions recommended in documents <a href="../pdf/A/59/451">A/59/451</a> to <a href="../pdf/A/59/466">A/59/466</a> for adoption by the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="p">I should like to speak in explanation of vote on draft resolution A/C.1/59/L.50, entitled "The Hague Code of Conduct against ballistic missile proliferation".</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation understands that the missile proliferation issue is being used to obstruct the development and the positioning of missiles by certain developing countries, particularly those countries that the United States and its allies detest. Those that have most of the missiles in the world are none other than the United States and its allies. They are developing new types of missiles, deploying them abroad and selling them to other countries.</div>
	<div class="p">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in dealing with the missile issue, always refers to the political and military situation that has been created on the Korean peninsula. The United States and its allies in the region have deployed numerous nuclear missiles around the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, blockading it militarily and threatening a pre-emptive strike against it. In these circumstances, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has no interest in any debate which may negatively affect the development, production and deployment of missiles for its self-defence.</div>
	<div class="p">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is concerned at the use, under the pretext of non-proliferation, of double standards with respect to the efforts of the developing countries to strengthen their self-defence forces and to develop space technology. However, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, out of respect for the idea of the draft resolution, will not participate in the voting.</div>

	Mr. Laurin (Canada)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have taken the floor to explain Canada's vote in favour of the resolution entitled "The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East". It is important for Canada to ensure that our position is not misunderstood or misrepresented, and we would be vigilant in that regard.</div>
	<div class="p">In April 2004, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Resolution 1540 (2004) calls on all States</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"to promote the universal adoption and full implementation, and, where necessary, strengthening of multilateral treaties to which they are parties, whose aim is to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons". (<i>para. 8 (a</i>))</div>
	<div class="p">Canada, an original signatory and State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), voted in favour of today's resolution in due consideration of a number of factors, not the least of which is stipulated in resolution 1540 (2004), which I have just quoted. Canada has judged today's resolution on its merit and determined that it is entirely consistent with Canada's long-standing nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation policy. The resolution is firmly grounded in the consensus achieved by NPT States parties and reflected in the Final Document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. Our vote in favour of the resolution was announced in the Canadian statement to the plenary of the General Assembly in the debate on agenda item 37, "Question of Palestine", on 30 November.</div>
	<div class="p">Canada urges Israel, in the crucial months leading up to the 2005 NPT Review Conference, to take the necessary first steps to adhere to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State. Canada further calls on all States in the Middle East region to comply fully with their NPT obligations and, in that regard, urges all States in the region that have not yet done so to sign and fully implement safeguard agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency.</div>
