	<div class="p">As members will recall, when the 60th plenary meeting was adjourned earlier today, there still remained one seat from among the Eastern European States to be filled.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to the third round of balloting, by secret ballot, for the remaining seat.</div>
	<div class="p">The third round of balloting shall be restricted to the two States from among the Eastern European States that were not elected but that obtained the largest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely Belarus and Poland. That is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure.</div>
	<div class="p">Also in connection with this election, I would like to remind members that, in accordance with Article 19 of the Charter and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-58-1">resolution 58/1</a> of 16 October 2003, two Member States will not be given ballot papers.</div>
	<div class="p">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">We shall now begin the voting process.</div>
	<div class="p">Ballot papers marked "C" will now be distributed.</div>
	<div class="p">May I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers the name of the one State for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers marked "C" for the Eastern European States will be declared invalid if they contain the name of a State other than Belarus or Poland or if they contain the names of more than one State.</div>
