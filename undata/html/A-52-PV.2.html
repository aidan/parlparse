	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">All members of the General Assembly are eligible in this election except those already represented in the General Committee, namely, those countries whose representatives have been elected to the presidency of the General Assembly or to the chairmanships of the Main Committees.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-33-138.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 33/138</a>, the 21 Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session shall be elected according to the following pattern:</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa09">In accordance with paragraph 16 of annex VI to the rules of procedure, the election of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly by secret ballot will be dispensed with when the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled. We shall proceed accordingly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa10">I shall now read out the names of the endorsed candidates:</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa11">African States: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea, Togo, Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa12">Asian States: Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Qatar, Viet Nam.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">As members are aware, the Assembly, in paragraph 7 of its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-40-243.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 40/243</a>, decided that no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly should be permitted to meet at United Nations Headquarters during a regular session of the Assembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">As indicated in the letter I have just mentioned, the Committee on Conferences has recommended that the General Assembly authorize the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund, which has been meeting from 15 September of this year, to meet until 19 September 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">Bearing in mind that this period overlaps with the fifty-second session of the Assembly, may I take it that the General Assembly adopts the recommendation of the Committee on Conferences?</p>
