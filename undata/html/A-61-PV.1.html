	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk13-pa02">His Majesty King Taufa'ahaù Tupou IV was widely known as a man of vision who devoted his entire life to the cause of the development of his country. His 41 years of tireless service and wise leadership contributed greatly to the prosperity of his country. He was rightly known as the cultural father of the nation and will indeed be remembered, in particular, as a great man who was able to translate many of his dreams into reality for the benefit of his people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk13-pa03">The late King cared for his people, did much to modernize his country, and contributed immensely to the welfare and development of the Kingdom. Asia, together with the Tongan people, will also remember him for the role he played in improving education, health care and infrastructure in the country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk13-pa04">The Tongan people have lost a great leader and able statesman.

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk08-pa02">King Taufa'ahaù Tupou IV was a good friend of the United States, ensuring that Tonga stood shoulder to shoulder with us and others in promoting peace and stability in the Pacific region and the world, including, most recently, in Iraq.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk08-pa03">In the latter years of the reign of King Taufa'ahaù Tupou IV, Tonga took initial steps towards democracy and greater representation in Government. We wish the very best for King George Tupou V and the people of Tonga in advancing that important goal.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa01">I wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of His Majesty King George Tupou V, the royal household, the Government and the people of Tonga, to convey our deep appreciation for the kind messages of condolence and sympathy on the passing of our beloved King, Taufa'ahaù Tupou IV. His late Majesty King Taufa'ahaù Tupou IV was a God-fearing man, which enabled him to be a man of great vision. He had a long-term vision for Tonga and was the founder of modern Tonga.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa02">During his 41-year reign, his first and foremost concern was to see the advancement of the lives of his people in spirit, mind and body. He was a true pioneer and was not afraid to consider new ideas that might improve the quality of life of his people. He was the first Tongan subject to obtain a university degree; he earned a BA and LLB from the University of Sydney. Upon his return to Tonga, he served as Minister of Education in 1943 and Minister of Health in 1944, and he was Premier from 1949 until he became King in 1965.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa03">He was the main instigator and catalyst for the development and monetization of the Tongan economy, which saw the graduation of Tonga to developing-country status in the mid-1980s. When he was Minister of Education, he had a vision that, in view of Tonga's limited resource base, that the wealth of Tonga was in its people, and he established local schools that allowed for the training of the finest of young Tongan minds, later providing the first national scholarships for their overseas training. Tonga currently has a literacy rate of 99 per cent and has the highest per capita level of Ph.D. graduates.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa04">With the equivalent of more than 140 per cent of its national population overseas, Tonga has been able to export some of its finest academic, technical, sports and cultural talent. In terms of foreign policy, he enabled Tonga to progress from inward-looking policies to joining regional and international agencies as well as establishing diplomatic ties with many friendly countries. This has provided further support for Tonga's economic, social, cultural and political development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa05">His late Majesty served his country all his life as a citizen, a civil servant, a loving father, a lay preacher and a monarch. He has finished the race. He has kept the faith.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa01">I should like first of all to refer to yesterday's commemoration of the 11 September terrorist attacks, which took place five years ago, in 2001. We share the grief of the American people and of the families of the victims.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa02">It is an honour and pleasure for me to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for the support and confidence you have placed in me.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa03">I would like to begin by welcoming the Republic of Montenegro, the newest member of the United Nations family. I believe that it will play a valuable role in furthering the work and ideals of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa04">Today, the United Nations faces many challenges at all levels and therefore needs the support of the people of the world, just as the people of the world need this Organization, for this is an Organization of hope that is based on commitment, consensus and coexistence. The numerous meetings, discussions and conferences that bring together people from all over the world provide a real platform to exchange experiences and perspectives. This enables us to understand each other better, in order to achieve a global consensus on political, security, economic, environmental and social issues. Only by working together can we translate our commitments into effective actions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa05">The 2005 world summit was a prime example of this vision. It provided the General Assembly with a clear and wide-ranging reform agenda in the fields of development, international peace and security, human rights and management reforms. Its outcome was indeed a pillar of hope. It confirmed once again the strong and renewed commitment of the world's leaders to the values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, demonstrating, by their commitment, a solid resolve to implement the Millennium Development Goals.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa06">World leaders' collective vision of a more responsive multilateral approach to the many challenges facing the world will continue to guide our common efforts to build a safer, freer and more prosperous world for all human beings.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa07">The General Assembly at its sixtieth session, under the leadership of President Eliasson, implemented many of the recommendations adopted at the summit, such as the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council, the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund and the adoption of resolutions on development, management reform and a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa08">Here, I should like to congratulate President Eliasson for his tireless efforts to move the reform agenda forward. I commend all Member States for their cooperation and for the spirit of compromise shown throughout the sixtieth session. They worked under intense pressure, and I trust that we can continue to move ahead with the same momentum during this session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa09">I should also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts in the service of the mission and the ideals of the United Nations during his tenure. He has played a pivotal role in enhancing and strengthening the Organization to meet global challenges and the emerging needs of the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa10">It is important that we build upon, broaden and deepen the progress achieved thus far. Our achievements demonstrate the ability of the General Assembly to produce concrete results on important matters that concern the international community. They also demonstrate and confirm the continued importance of the Assembly as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa11">In order to continue playing that role, the General Assembly must continue to evolve and to strive to deliver sustainable solutions to the major challenges of our time. That can take place only within the framework of multilateralism. A well-functioning and proactive multilateral system is in the interest of all nations, particularly at a time when our growing interdependence is the basis for our peaceful coexistence. Multilateralism is the most effective way to ensure our collective peace and security, protect human rights and uphold the rule of law.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa12">I believe that it is the common responsibility of Member States to make the General Assembly and the United Nations as a whole even more effective. As efforts to revitalize the General Assembly are under way, we must not lose sight of the main purpose of those actions: to meet the rising expectations of hundreds of millions of people around the world. We have the challenging task of meeting the expectations of those who are poor, malnourished or illiterate or the victims of disease. We have the challenging task of ensuring their economic and social security, which is just as important as their political and military security. We have the challenging task of liberating them from want while seeking to liberate them from fear.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa13">I should also like to stress that more than half of the world's population -- namely, women -- typically have less access to health care, employment, decision-making and property ownership. That disparity must be addressed so that both women and men can enjoy the same opportunities, the same rights and the same responsibilities in all aspects of life. To promote gender equality, we need to empower women so that they have more autonomy to lead their lives. To achieve those goals, it is essential that we work closely together so that, together, we can promote human rights and achieve sustainable development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa14">We cannot confront all these challenges effectively if we do not have peace and security. The United Nations plays a crucial role in responding to the aftermath of natural disasters and maintaining peace and security in areas affected by violent conflict. Regrettably, the recent violence in the Middle East caused heavy casualties on both sides and extensively damaged the Lebanese infrastructure. Today, man-made conflicts are destroying lives and displacing people on a scale sometimes exceeding that of the destructive effects of nature, including floods and hurricanes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa15">The people of the world have placed an enormous responsibility on our shoulders, as Member States, to identify and address the causes of human conflicts. Only by working together will we be able to defeat the injustices that are at the root of conflicts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa16">International terrorism is another equally pressing and closely related issue. We must develop and adopt both preventive and defensive measures to combat terrorism. Within that context, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of high-quality education and conscientious media as positive vehicles for nurturing tolerance, compassion and critical thinking.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa17">Now that the Assembly has adopted a resolution on a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (<a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-60-288.pdf">resolution 60/288</a>), I hope that during this session we can continue our efforts to successfully reach agreement on a comprehensive convention on terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa18">As we prepare ourselves to complete the tasks remaining from the previous session, we shall not overlook those recommendations of the 2005 World Summit Outcome (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf">resolution 60/1</a>) that have yet to be fully implemented, such as disarmament and non-proliferation, Security Council reform, mandate review and system-wide coherence. All of these are crucially important agendas. Working together in the spirit of multilateralism to achieve these goals, we can deliver a programme of work to renew, strengthen and update the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa19">Reform is a process rather than an event, and we will need to actively pursue work on a variety of pending issues. I trust that Member States will work together to address every issue on its own merits so that progress can be achieved at a steady pace on all the various aspects of the reform agenda.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa20">We, the Member States, must identify our priorities. I will be more than happy to listen to members' views during the general debate and in the months ahead so that, together, we can design an action-oriented and practical workplan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa21">Before that, we will hold the first ever High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. I anticipate that the discussions will underscore the challenges of migration and development and the need for a collective initiative.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa22">The following week, we will hold a High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010. It will outline the successes achieved and the obstacles faced by the least developed countries and lay down guidelines for the way forward -- actions that need to be taken by the least developed countries, their development partners and the international community as a whole to successfully implement the Programme of Action.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa23">Here, I should like to commend the important role that non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector play in the work of the General Assembly. It is my intention to continue to encourage and value their contributions in addressing the many challenges confronting the international community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa24">Since its inception in 1945, the United Nations has been a global beacon of hope and a global humanitarian necessity. Indeed, world leaders and thinkers had many years before expressed the need for a truly global forum based on high ideals. At the Paris Conference in January 1919, the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, called for the creation of an organization that would be the eye of the nations, to keep watch and act on their common interests -- an eye that does not slumber, but is everywhere attentive.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa25">Today, should that eye become weary, it is up to us, the Member States, to revitalize and reinforce its role so that our Organization remains the beacon of hope for the peace, prosperity and order of all nations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa01">It is certainly a source of delight to see a woman at the helm of this body for the third time in the history of the United Nations -- and, for the first time ever, an Arab woman.

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Our work during the sixtieth session highlighted the eagerness of Member States to seize the opportunity to reassert the relevance and importance of the United Nations -- and the General Assembly in particular -- with respect to the issues at the top of the international agenda. It also highlighted the need to carry out the negotiations to implement the relevant outcomes in a manner that is fair, transparent and inclusive. We have managed, with a keen sense of purpose, to achieve a great deal including the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund, the establishment of the Human Rights Council, the setting up of the Central Emergency Response Fund and the establishment of the Ethics Office, to mention only a few.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa03">Furthermore, we successfully adopted a development follow-up resolution and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, management reform as well as resolutions on the enhancement of the oversight machinery of the Organization, the revitalization of the General Assembly and mandate review.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa04">That work was not easy. It took all of us days -- indeed, weeks -- of negotiations. It also represented a daunting challenge to prove to ourselves, and to the entire world, that the United Nations is still relevant, and that the General Assembly, with its universal membership, is the only global body that is capable of delivering such courageous and bold actions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa05">I should therefore like to place on record the appreciation of the African Group in New York -- appreciation that I am sure we all feel -- for the productive manner in which the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, Foreign Minister of Sweden, carried out his arduous and important duties. Without his readiness to accept responsibility and the influence he exerted on his colleagues, we might not have been able to meet at this time and look back to appraise how much we have implemented of the 2005 Summit Outcome document.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa06">In the meantime, we look forward to the implementation of those resolutions during the sixty-first session. Moreover, we need to deliver on environmental governance and the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council, and achieve a more coherent system to better support Member States in their efforts to realize the Millennium Development Goals. We wish above all to see a revitalized General Assembly that lives up to the aspirations of Member States and all peoples across the globe. We need to continue our work to revitalize its role, in particular as regards the selection process of the Secretary-General, which will surely be a step forward.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa07">As we remember the tragic incidents that shocked the world five years ago, and as we pay tribute to the innocent lives lost at the hands of terrorists, we are also happy to note the conclusion, at the end of the sixtieth session, of a counter-terrorism strategy. We hope that that humble achievement will help their souls to rest in peace and help to bring comfort to their families and loved ones. We should take this opportunity to make a solemn pledge to the victims of terrorism everywhere.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa08">The sixtieth session witnessed a number of achievements related to the special needs of Africa. We saw the debt cancellation of some African countries in order to alleviate the debt-servicing burden and to enable them to focus on achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We saw the start of a number of quick-win projects and increased cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa09">At the same time, with great achievements come great responsibilities. The myriad challenges confronting the continent prod the international community's sense of obligation to act swiftly to lend a helping hand to end Africa's marginalization in the world economy and institutionalize effective cooperation mechanisms to respond to the continent's multidimensional requirements in a comprehensive manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa10">The Peacebuilding Commission is an integral mechanism that should act as a crucible for collective efforts in post-conflict situations. However, we must be fully aware that quick fixes do not solve deeply rooted problems and that externally prescribed treatments do not offer a panacea. The answers have to come from within.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa11">The reports that the Secretary-General has submitted annually since 1998 on the causes of conflict in Africa have been extremely useful in identifying a wide array of issues critical to the achievement of comprehensive peace in Africa. We look forward to the sixty-first session devoting considerable attention to addressing the negative effects of those issues, including the illegal exploitation of natural resources.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa12">The outcomes of the Banjul summit attest to Africa's firm determination to implement its peace and security policy. The ongoing efforts to establish a continent-wide early warning system, a panel of the wise and an African standby force will in time constitute, together with the Peace and Security Council, the cornerstones of that policy. However, the gap in terms of resources and technical expertise continues to shackle Africa's ability to realize its potential. Thus, a robust and timely response by the United Nations and the rest of the international community is essential to help bridge that gap.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa13">Africa's quest for development not only stems from the inalienable right of all States to development, but is also the overwhelming desire of all its peoples and a duty to the coming generations. Restoring a just and comprehensive peace and lasting stability is fundamental if African States are to retain their place among equals in a democratic United Nations -- a United Nations that, we hope, the sixty-first session will bring us a step closer towards achieving.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa14">The African Group pledges its full support for your efforts, Madam President. We look forward to working closely with you and assisting you in carrying out your responsibilities during the sixty-first session.</div>
