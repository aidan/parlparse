	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">This morning the General Assembly will proceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">The 18 outgoing members are: Angola, Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Italy, Kuwait, Madagascar, the Philippines, Poland, Suriname, Swaziland and the United States of America.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">I should like to remind members of the Assembly that, as of 1 January 1995, the following States will continue to be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Bahamas, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Egypt, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United Republic of Tanzania, Venezuela, Zaire and Zimbabwe. The names of those 36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account the number of States which will remain members of the Council after 1 January 1995, the 18 members should be elected as follows: five from African States, four from Asian States, two from Eastern European States, three from Latin American and Caribbean States and four from Western European and other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">I should like to inform the Assembly that the candidates receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting, and not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>
