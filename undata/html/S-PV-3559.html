	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in Haiti, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-614.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/614</a>. Members of the Council also have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1995-629.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/629</a>, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by Argentina, Canada, France, Honduras, the United States of America and Venezuela.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">The first speaker is the representative of Canada. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Karsgaard</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">As this is the first time my delegation has addressed the Council this month, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of July and on the effective way you have led the Council's work this month. I also wish to thank the Permanent Representative of Germany for his leadership during the month of June.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">When the Security Council met in January this year to authorize the deployment of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), the international community was hopeful that Haiti was moving forward in its efforts to build a stable and democratic society. In the past six months, Haiti has made important progress in this direction. Without denying the obstacles ahead, Haitians can now look to the future with more hope and less fear. UNMIH, in carrying out its mandate, is playing a significant role in supporting this process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Canada welcomes in particular UNMIH's success in helping to create security and stability in Haiti. While crime remains a problem, the fundamentals of the situation have changed completely. Political oppression has ended. Assassinations committed with the complicity of public authorities have ceased. Those having committed these crimes in the past are no longer immune from prosecution. The Haitian people are increasingly aware of their rights and are able to exercise them freely.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">In order to guarantee long-term security and stability, Canada is working with the Haitian Government and others, including France and the United States, to create a new professional civilian police force, fully trained in the respect for human rights. More than 700 police officers have already been trained by the Haitian Police Academy in Port-au-Prince and have been deployed throughout the country. A new class of 350 graduates will join them in the coming days. UNMIH's role in establishing an effective police force is essential. The support and advice they are providing is key to their success.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Long-term security and stability in Haiti also depends on the consolidation of the rule of law and the existence of an independent judiciary respectful of citizens' rights. In this regard, we very much welcome and underline the importance of efforts of the international community, as noted in report of the Secretary-General, to put in place a functioning judiciary. The opening of a magistrate's school in Port-au-Prince is a positive step in what is a long-term but nevertheless crucial element for the future of democracy in Haiti. Canada is participating in these efforts through, among other projects, a programme to reactivate the lower court system through the repair of courthouses and a training programme for officials.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">On 25 June last, Haiti held its first free elections since the coup d'état of 30 September 1991. The organization of this vote presented tremendous logistical challenges. The elections were held in an environment largely free of violence in the majority of Haitian communities. This is an encouraging sign of the democratic will of the Haitian people and of the hard work of Haitian electoral officials and international observers across the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">In our view, the first round of the legislative and municipal elections constituted an important step in Haiti's political, social and economic development, and indicate that democracy is taking hold in Haiti. UNMIH made a vital contribution to this process by helping to ensure public security and providing logistical support to the Provisional Electoral Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">However, the vote did not occur without significant problems, as reflected in the report prepared by the Organization of American States electoral observation mission. We strongly urge all parties to this process to resolve these difficulties and ensure that the elections are completed in a fair and free manner.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">The work accomplished to date by UNMIH in discharging its mandate has been impressive. The draft resolution the Security Council is considering today will extend the mandate of the Mission until February 1996. We believe it will be important to consider, well in advance of the expiration of this mandate, ways to ensure that what we are helping Haitians to build will continue. It would be unfortunate if the democratic foundations for Haiti's future, which we are helping to construct through our considerable investment in UNMIH, were to crumble in the absence of sustained engagement by the international community. To this end, we look forward to the report of the Secretary-General at the mid-point of this upcoming mandate extension period, as called for in the draft resolution, and to discussing options for a continued international presence in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">UNMIH is providing an essential and undeniable contribution to the return of stability and the construction of a democratic society in Haiti. UNMIH's personnel have carried out their tasks with considerable professionalism and have the confidence of the Haitian people. For these reasons, Canada is pleased to support and co-sponsor the draft resolution before the Security Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Canada for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Haiti, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Longchamp</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">My delegation wishes to express its gratification at seeing you, Sir, presiding over the work of the Council for the month of July. We have no doubt that your proven diplomatic skills, your clear-sightedness and your savoir-faire have ensured the success of the work of the Security Council throughout this month.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The delegation of Haiti sincerely thanks the Secretary-General for his report on the activities of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), which the Council, in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>, entrusted with assisting the Haitian Government in its task of sustaining the secure and stable environment established during the multinational phase, professionalizing the armed forces, creating a civilian police force distinct from the army, and organizing and holding the necessary municipal and legislative elections needed to ensure the irreversible establishment of democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Our delegation fully concurs with the views of the Secretary-General to the effect that UNMIH personnel are performing their tasks in an exemplary manner.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">Thanks to UNMIH's assistance, political violence has markedly decreased, along with the crime rate, which at one time was strongly undermining the Haitian people's confidence in the process of restoring constitutional order to the country. These days, night life has been restored, especially in Port-au-Prince, as illustrated by the successful holding of a cultural festival this past weekend, by the "Bouyon rasin" group, at the Sylvio Cator stadium in Port-au-Prince, whose performances ended only in the wee hours of the morning. Of course, total security is a long way away, but the general feeling of uncertainty is lifting.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Ironically, the unexpected collapse of Haiti's security forces has contributed to this situation. Therefore, in order to ensure the security of key installations and within the framework of professionalizing Haitian armed forces, special training units have been set up. In addition to the presidential guard, a ministerial security unit, a judiciary security unit, a port security unit and an airport security unit have been set up. Other bodies, such as the border guards and the coast guard, will shortly become operational.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">Furthermore, the interim police force is performing its task very satisfactorily. Three successive classes of the new police academy have already been deployed in various Haitian cities: Pétion-Ville, Delmas, Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haïtien and Gonaïves. The current Government is confident that on 7 February 1996, when power is transferred to the new Government, Haiti will have the appropriate infrastructure and personnel to ensure the security of the population and of its institutions and to protect the territorial integrity of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">Along with the creation of security institutions, the Government is engaged in a vast reform of the penal and judicial system. A new justice academy has been set up, and retraining courses have been organized for judicial personnel already in their posts. Special emphasis has been placed on the management of detention centres. Many of them have been, or are in the process of being, renovated.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">More qualified staff have been recruited and training courses have been held for the prison guards. In order to ensure that the sufferings of the people who were victims of the coup d'état are taken into account, a new National Commission for Truth and Justice has been set up by the Government to carry out inquiries into violations of human rights that took place between 29 September 1991 and 15 October 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">All these initiatives have helped to create the right environment for the holding of the legislative and municipal elections that took place in the month of June. Despite a number of problems which prevented many from voting, the popular turnout was considered to be reasonable. The organizational conditions were far from ideal, and some incidents took place which led either to the postponement or the cancellation of elections in certain areas. For that reason, before the holding of the second round of balloting, partial elections will take place in those areas where it was not possible to hold elections on 25 June.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">However, given the dissatisfaction of certain political organizations and the threatened boycott of the second round by certain candidates, the Provisional Electoral Council has been reorganized, following the resignation of its chairman. It is to be hoped that the organization of complementary elections and the second round will take into account the shortcomings of the first round.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">Generally speaking, normal life in Haiti is beginning to be organized on a democratic basis, to the great satisfaction of Haitians. Unfortunately, the effects of the coup d'état on the country's economy, which was already in poor health, are for the moment the greatest impediment to stability. Despite significant budgetary performance and the generosity of the international community, the bulk of the Government's activities up to now have been aimed solely at the balance of payments, the operation of State institutions, urgent humanitarian aid and the restoration of stocks.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">To facilitate the transition of most Haitians from subhuman destitution to poverty with dignity remains the fundamental aim; only by achieving this goal can the programme of national reconciliation of the Government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide be completed. For this purpose, the Government is developing and setting up flexible mechanisms which can take available resources and turn them into sources of employment.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">Exactly a year ago, the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>. At that time, Haiti was under the yoke of a ferocious military dictatorship; there was no freedom in the country, not even freedom of religion. Though all is not yet rosy, at least there is now hope. For the people of Haiti have once again won the right to decide on their own destiny, and I am certain that they will make good use of it. I should like here to hail the courage of that people, whose resolve has rewarded the support of the international community and made it possible to restore constitutional order to Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa14">My delegation anticipates with satisfaction the decision that the Security Council is going to take to authorize the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), and wishes to express its thanks to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Haiti, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, to the personnel of UNMIH, and to all those who have done their utmost to make the Mission the success it is. The Government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide will continue to work closely with the United Nations Mission in Haiti during its time in office so that these successes can be made permanent.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Haiti for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wibisono</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">My delegation would first of all like to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report regarding the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). We would also like to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to Haiti, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and all the personnel of UNMIH for the exemplary manner with which they have carried out their tasks on our behalf. My delegation is pleased at the overall success of the Mission, and especially at the continuing smooth transfer of responsibility to the Haitian authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The role of UNMIH has been crucial in assisting the Government of Haiti in its efforts to build a more democratic, secure and stable nation. Their success has been reflected by the outcome of the recent elections held on 25 June 1995, in which a large percentage of the Haitian people assembled peacefully and safely to cast their votes freely. Their enthusiastic participation in the presidential election to be held later this year will be a further essential step towards the consolidation of democracy. The democratization process in Haiti, however, should be built upon national reconciliation. In this regard, the efforts of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to promote that process have been indispensable in creating a climate conducive to democracy, as Haiti prepares for the completion of these elections and the subsequent presidential elections. Eventually, the future of Haiti will be in the hands of its people. International assistance only complements their efforts to achieve peace, democracy and the development of their country.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The restructuring of Haiti involves the reform of the Government, the military, and the economy -- all at the same time. My delegation is of the view that without a stable Government, the security of the people cannot be guaranteed. Without security and stability, the economic development of Haiti cannot be achieved. There is a link between peace, stability and development in Haiti. Therefore, adequate security is needed to protect the people of Haiti. In this regard, we commend the UNMIH personnel for their key role in establishing a civilian police force. The full functioning of the National Police is necessary for the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti's system of justice. Creating and expanding Haiti's National Police will also be vital to the security of the Government and its people. The establishment of a police force of an adequate size and structure is not a simple task, but it is essential to the security of democracy. My delegation believes that the civilian police component of UNMIH has played a major role in establishing such a police force.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">The overall security of Haiti, and especially of the capital, Port-au-Prince, has improved continuously since the last report of the Secretary-General. Political violence, vigilante killings and common crime have decreased dramatically, indicating that the rule of law has become stronger and more accepted by the citizens of Haiti. Generally, the security of the Mission is on solid ground; there are few threats to its personnel or challenges to its authority. My delegation believes that by next February, after the transition to a fair, just, and sufficiently strong Government of Haiti, there will continue to be a strong deterrent against crime. Hence, we hope that the UNMIH mandate can be concluded as soon as a new, constitutionally elected Government assumes office in an orderly manner.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">The results of the reforms in government, security structures and the economy in Haiti have made possible a variety of positive social changes. We applaud the ongoing reform of the judicial and penal systems, including new prisons, retrained guards and newly trained prosecutors. These institutions will ensure that justice is swift but fair and that the rights of accused and convicted persons are not infringed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">We commend the many people who have promoted projects to improve power supply, transport and repatriation of refugees and the development of health programmes. Swift progress has been made in such areas as immunization, family planning, education and programmes for the supply of food and clean water. Such programmes are the ultimate goal of restructuring -- that is, raising the standard of living, for the betterment of all Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">To further these social goals, it is essential that the development of Haiti's democratic process be accompanied by economic development. The international community should place emphasis on conflict prevention and should aim at the roots of conflict, such as underdevelopment and the lack of a legitimate political institution. Therefore it is vital that the international community ensure that its efforts to rebuild the three pillars of this burgeoning democracy -- government, security structures and the economy -- do not fall short of our expectations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">My delegation therefore underlines the importance of paragraph 10 of the draft resolution, which calls upon</p>
	<blockquote id="pg005-bk01-pa09">"States and international institutions to continue to provide assistance to the Government and people of Haiti as they consolidate the gains made towards democracy and stability."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">The settlement in Haiti has proved to the world that constructive cooperation and consultation between the United Nations Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS) is critical to the success of international assistance for political progress and stability. The transformation of Haiti has proved that joint efforts by the United Nations and a regional organization can help to bring about peace and stability in that region.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">My delegation will support the draft resolution extending the mandate of United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) for a period of seven months, by which time, we believe, Haiti will have a Government, chosen by the people of Haiti through free and fair elections, that is capable of governing peacefully and justly. By allowing a little more time to facilitate the transfer of the control of Haiti completely to the authority of the Haitian people, we anticipate the development of Haiti into a safe democracy that will be respected throughout the world.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">On the basis of these considerations, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nkgowe</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The delegation of Botswana follows the developments in Haiti with keen interest, and in this regard we are grateful to the Secretary-General for his report on the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). We note with satisfaction that Haiti has already achieved such a level of stability that it qualified as the venue for a successful general assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS), among other international activities in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">We are a little concerned that the conduct of the municipal and legislative elections was, in some respects, not as smooth as we would have otherwise wished it to be. We are, however, gratified that all the organizational problems and shortcomings enumerated in the report of the Secretary-General were genuine mistakes, which were not directed at any participating political party or meant to benefit anybody. We hope that all concerned individuals and organizations will treat them as useful lessons that will be helpful in the remaining elections, to be held later this year.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">UNMIH is doing a marvellous job to assist in the democratization process in Haiti, and it deserves the commendation of the Security Council, especially for its contribution to the prevailing sense of safety and security in the country. It is interesting to note that the rather pervasive spate of politically motivated and vigilante killings that prevailed at the beginning of the year is giving way to an atmosphere of relative calm and stability. In this regard, we note with satisfaction the progress being made in the training and deployment of the Haitian National Police and other security units, which are gradually assuming greater responsibility for law and order in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">We support the incorporation of elements of economic and social development into peace-keeping operations, but within certain limits of the mandate of the mission itself. We believe that the twin processes of peace and development should go hand in hand, as economic development is indispensable to post-conflict stability in the country when the United Nations peace-keeping Mission has left. This is already paying dividends in Haiti. Economic revival in Haiti would open up employment opportunities for the demobilized police and military personnel, who could otherwise become a source of political instability.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">The people of Haiti deserve the assistance and cooperation of the international community to consolidate the gains made so far and as they tackle the tasks ahead. We hope that such support will be forthcoming.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">We are in full support of the extension of the mandate of UNMIH until the end of February 1996. We hope that there will be no need for the Security Council to renew the mandate next year. UNMIH is, on the whole, doing so well that there is no reason to doubt the successful conclusion of its work. We shall therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Qin Huasun</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">The Chinese delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). The Chinese Government and people have all along supported the peace process in Haiti and the unremitting efforts of the United Nations to assist the Haitian people to achieve lasting peace. We welcome the fresh progress in the Haitian peace process, marked by a situation that is, on the whole, stable, the fairly smooth first round of legislative elections and the continued improvement in the security situation in Haiti. We appreciate the success that UNMIH has achieved in assisting the Haitian Government to maintain a secure and stable environment.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">We have also noted that there are still many problems in Haiti today, as is pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report. The Haitian peace process is now at a critical stage. We hope that the draft resolution before the Security Council today will help the Haitian Government and people, with the assistance of the international community, to enhance national reconciliation and overcome the difficulties on the way ahead so as to create a favourable internal and external environment for the rebuilding of their homeland.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">In supporting the draft resolution, the Chinese delegation has also taken into consideration the ardent aspiration of the Latin American countries to consolidate the achievements of peace in Haiti. The Chinese people have most warm feelings towards the Latin American people. China has consistently supported the Haitian people in their efforts to seek peace and stability and to rebuild their country, believing that this will help to maintain peace and stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">We sincerely hope that UNMIH will successfully accomplish its mandate in Haiti, thus making its contribution to peace and development in Haiti and in Latin America as a whole. We are of the view that the establishment of a stable environment of peace favourable for economic development is the only way to a strong and prosperous country.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa02">I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements following the voting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Albright</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa01">One year ago today, this Council took the historic decision to authorize Member States to use all necessary means to restore legitimate constitutional authority in Haiti. Since then, we have come a long way. The former de facto authorities have left Haiti, President Aristide has returned to office, a multinational force established a secure and stable environment in the country and parliamentary elections have been held. President Aristide's return to Haiti marked the end of a long dry season of tyranny and abuse, and marked the start of Haiti's own journey toward full, institutionalized democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa02">Today, we have acted to renew the commitment of the international community to assist the people of Haiti on this journey. We have shown our support by extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) through February 1996. At that time, UNMIH will conclude its mandate as foreseen in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>. UNMIH's contribution to the beginnings of a peaceful, democratic and prosperous Haiti fulfils the best aspirations of the community of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa03">We pay special tribute today to the courageous men and women who have committed themselves, as part of UNMIH, to the future of Haiti. Their work must continue. We also give special thanks to the Special Representative, Mr. Brahimi. That is why the United States proudly joined with the Friends of Haiti in sponsoring the resolution we adopt here today to extend UNMIH's mandate through February 1996.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa04">Thanks to the support of the international community, Haiti held its first democratic elections in five years last month, and is preparing for the completion of those elections. While there were some serious problems, the election was a positive step toward the consolidation of Haiti's democracy. International observers saw few examples of electoral fraud, and no evidence of any large-scale or systematic effort to subvert the elections or skew the results. However, in many cases, the process was, in the words of one observer, &quot;free, fair and fouled-up.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa05">None the less, it required great courage and faith for 2 million Haitians to go to the polls on 25 June and join the march toward democracy. UNMIH, along with the International Civilian Mission (MICIVIH), contributed to the people's sense of security on the morning of 25 June.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa06">The Haitian people are approaching another milestone on the journey of democracy: next February, a transition from one elected Government to another. While many nations take this for granted, Haiti has never seen such an event. The Haitian people have suffered for decades under despots; they are now embracing their new ability to choose their leaders. This is a transition made possible by the presence of UNMIH.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa07">UNMIH's mandate -- to assist the Haitian Government in maintaining a secure and stable environment, to protect the Government of Haiti and key installations, to assist in the holding of elections and to professionalize the security forces -- is an effective one, which we have extended in the spirit of our original commitment in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>. UNMIH has made significant progress and, with this extension, will be allowed to finish what it has started.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa08">My delegation agrees with the Secretary-General's observation that effective policing capabilities and related institution-building efforts are urgently required in Haiti. President Aristide has expressed similar concerns. The new Haitian National Police will be in place by early next year, and my Government is cooperating extensively with efforts to train and equip this new force. The recent deployment of 700 members of the new police and continuing efforts in Haiti to train new judicial personnel are important first steps. The role of UNMIH's civilian police contingent in this effort has been noteworthy. We echo the Secretary-General's appeal to Member States to contribute additional funds for this vital undertaking.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa09">Our task now is threefold: first, to ensure completion of free and fair elections. To achieve this, we must encourage the people of Haiti to remain committed to the electoral process; we must encourage Haiti's electoral authorities to improve that process, and we must encourage Haiti's political parties -- whether they be losers or winners this time around -- to stay in the game. Most importantly, we must help strengthen the mechanisms needed to make sure that this electoral milestone leads to a duly constituted and freely elected system of government.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa10">Secondly, we must vigorously continue all efforts to complete the creation of a professional civilian police force and an effective justice system. Thirdly, we must continue to ensure coordination of effective technical and economic assistance to help Haiti rebuild. Here we underscore the pivotal role of international financial institutions, the United Nations specialized agencies, and Member States' economic and technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa11">These efforts in Haiti signal the broader commitment of the international community, spearheaded by the United Nations, to build democracy. This will be a long road for Haiti, but our renewal of UNMIH today is another step forward in this historic endeavour. Our destination is clear and within reach: a democratic and independent Haiti, where peace is sustained, human rights are respected and prosperity is possible.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cárdenas</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">We have just renewed the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) for a further period of seven months, which we hope will be the last period. This is legitimate grounds for satisfaction because of the sense of confidence we feel when taking a decision on a process which seems to be successfully moving towards a lasting solution.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Argentina, a member of the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti, which has, as is clear from its actions, played a leading role in South America in the difficult task of restoring democracy in Haiti, feels particularly strong satisfaction.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">The fulfilment of UNMIH's mandate no longer seems in doubt. The activities of the Special Representative, Mr. Brahimi, as well as his closest associates and all the personnel of the mission, has been impeccable and we encourage them to continue their efforts which will make possible the successful culmination of their difficult task.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">That additional effort should continue to press forward towards the goals that the Security Council has set with respect to sustaining a secure and stable environment, the creation of a separate police force and the professionalization of the armed forces, as well as the establishment of an environment conducive to the holding of elections.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">The legislative and municipal elections held on 25 June, despite certain organizational and procedural errors which should be corrected in the future, represent clear proof of the Haitian people's commitment to the restoration of their institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We hope - I repeat - that future elections will not be delayed and may be free from such procedural irregularities as have occurred.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">The comprehensive report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-614.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/614</a>) before the Council for its deliberations, which have culminated in the resolution we have adopted today, contains observations and recommendations with which we agree. Among other things, the report places on record the significant relevance of cooperation in this undertaking with the Organization of American States. We are convinced of the desirability of coordinated and concerted action and of the division of labour in initiatives that lend themselves to the involvement of our world Organization with the appropriate regional organization.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">In the case of Haiti, the combination of peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building efforts, as reflected in a range of specific projects described by the Secretary-General, shows that combining the two is not merely possible but desirable.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Let me conclude by stressing the importance of the presence of the Organization and of Member States that have provided personnel to the efforts to consolidate democracy in Haiti. We hope that the commitment of the Haitian people to its present course of reconciliation proves irreversible, so that after so much crime, so much suffering and so many denials that people -- the object of our efforts -- may at last enjoy the peace, security, respect for human rights and general stability that are inherent in any democratic society.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Eitel</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">Germany has just voted in favour of the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) for a further period of seven months. Since its full deployment, which began last February, considerable progress has been achieved. With the assistance of UNMIH, a secure and stable environment was consolidated. The establishment of a civilian police force is well on its way. UNMIH's presence permitted elections to take place in a climate of unprecedented freedom and security. My Government therefore wishes to express its gratitude to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and to the members and staff of UNMIH for their assistance to the Government and the people of Haiti in their quest for strong and lasting democracy, economic prosperity and national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">However, further efforts are required. The situation is still fragile. Further stabilization of democracy in Haiti depends on success in the economic and social reconstruction of the country. The international community will have to continue its efforts to enable the Government and people of Haiti to consolidate the gains achieved so far. My Government is committed to participating fully in this endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">We are further hopeful that, in the end, the ongoing elections will provide a generally accepted foundation for the future political life of Haiti. We feel, however, that an improved dialogue among all political actors will be necessary in order to establish a national consensus concerning the future of Haiti. The organizational shortcomings in the first round of the elections will have to be overcome in order to establish an atmosphere of trust and confidence. All parties are called upon to intensify their cooperation in order to achieve a common understanding, which should enable all of them to participate in the next electoral rounds. In the end, this should lead to a self-sustained peace process, to stable democracy and to economic development. We will have to follow closely events in Haiti as the present mandate evolves in order to determine to what extent our further assistance will be required.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Menzione</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Italy voted in favour of the resolution just adopted by the Security Council, in which the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) was renewed until February of next year. We believe, in fact, that the presence of UNMIH has provided an effective and crucial contribution to the affirmation in that Caribbean country of an institutional framework inspired by democratic principles, just as it has contributed to launching the process of national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">It is our hope that the efforts of the international community will be matched by those of the country's authorities and political forces so that the process may come to a positive conclusion. The efforts of all will be necessary so that the progress attained thus far, in particular through the holding of administrative elections and the first round of legislative elections, is consolidated in coming months, and so that at the end of its mandate UNMIH can be a witness to and a participant in the birth of a new democracy -- on quite a fragile foundation, to be sure, but with solid possibilities for success.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Progress on the political and institutional fronts too will be determined to a large extent by the success of efforts currently under way for economic recovery. The Secretary-General's initiatives on coordinating UNMIH's peace-keeping mission with development activities, in a manner consistent with its mandate, to strengthen Haiti's institutions will have particular importance in this regard. Once again, the unbreakable bond between political stability and economic development is highlighted. The presence of the United Nations contributed to liberating the Haitian population from physical fear and to setting out the conditions for the development of democracy. Now the other primary needs must be addressed, and a real improvement in living conditions must quickly be achieved.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">One last word on an aspect of great importance -- the security of the population. UNMIH has achieved a lot, with the help of the international community as well, towards improving general security conditions in the country. The next few months will be crucial for establishing police forces that must, of course, be totally different from those of the past, but at the same time efficient and well organized. This too will determine the future of Haiti.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gomersall</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The adoption of today's resolution marks another step forward in Haiti's progress towards a fully functioning democracy. The resolution pays well deserved tribute to the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), to the Secretary-General's Special Representative and to those countries which have contributed to the Mission. UNMIH is well on the way to achieving the goals set out for it in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>. My Government takes particular note of the Secretary-General's belief that, as envisaged in that resolution, the mandate extension for UNMIH which this Council has just authorized should enable the Mission to complete its tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">My Government wishes to congratulate UNMIH on the smooth transition from the multinational force and on the success of its mission so far. We welcome the holding of legislative elections, but we share the concerns of others at reports that irregularities occurred during the process. It is important that those responsible for organizing the next round of elections focus on solving the logistical and administrative problems which emerged.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">My Government will continue to support the efforts of the international community to restore security and democracy in Haiti, but the final responsibility for this rests with the people of Haiti itself. It is therefore essential that all political parties should participate in the electoral process, with a view to achieving the conclusion of the mandate of UNMIH as outlined in the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">We are encouraged by the confidence of the Secretary-General that the monthly cost of UNMIH will be contained within the amount already authorized by the General Assembly. This welcome evidence of effective management should not, however, divert us from the need to find an equitable long-term solution to the problem of financing peace-keeping operations. As my delegation has made clear on other occasions, we would not wish to confront a situation in which the sponsors of a resolution and the direct beneficiaries of enhanced regional stability were unable to assure the United Nations of their ability to pay their contributions to the United Nations in full while others were doing so.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">In conclusion, my delegation looks forward to the continued consolidation of representative Government and peaceful civil society in Haiti over the coming months and to the conclusion of UNMIH's mission after a successful presidential election and inauguration early next year.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ladsous</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">My delegation was very pleased to vote in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1007(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1007 (1995)</a> extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) to February 1996. We note, however, that when things are going well, the norm entails a renewal of at least six months. But this is becoming all too rare.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">At a time when other peace-keeping operations are running into serious difficulties, we have every reason to welcome the success of UNMIH. It is undeniable that, since the intervention of the multinational force pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 940 (1994)</a>, followed by UNMIH's assumption of its tasks, the situation in the country has changed irreversibly. This may seem banal today, but the fear and violence that were so recently a part of everyday life have disappeared. The country is enjoying an unprecedented level of security. Authentic political life has resumed, as witnessed in the first round of municipal and legislative elections. These represent a crucial stage in the restoration of democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">It is because of the symbolic importance of these elections that France and the European Union made significant financial and human contributions to them. We will of course continue to do so in order to ensure the success of subsequent stages until we reach the high point of the presidential elections, to be held in a free and fair manner in accordance with the Haitian Constitution. It is true that the first round experienced some logistical difficulties, irregularities or shortcomings, but these in no way impaired the results. Certain political groupings which consider themselves losers are contesting the results, however, and threaten to withdraw from the process by not participating in the next round.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">We believe that this is a mistake. Democracy is made up precisely of elections lost and elections won, a real change of power based on the free choice of the electors. That is precisely why the United Nations intervened in Haiti: to enable the country to enjoy the rights of democratic nations that had been previously flouted.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">My country appeals to all parties concerned -- President Aristide, political parties, the Haitian people and the Provisional Electoral Council -- to participate in the next round of elections. President Aristide continues to advocate dialogue; a reorganization has already been announced by the Provisional Electoral Council to remedy the shortcomings of the first round, which we welcome. Moreover, compromise proposals have been made which the political parties must address. Rejection would be a very serious decision on their part and would place the onus for stalling the political process on them.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">My delegation wishes to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General's Special Representative, whose competence and wisdom have contributed directly to very positive results. We also wish to thank the entire team of UNMIH and that of MICIVIH for their important contributions in the defence of human rights and the civic education of the population. My delegation also believes that cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States is a model that could be useful to other operations on other continents.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">In his report, the Secretary-General stresses the importance of an effective police force and the reform of the judicial system to consolidating the democratic process on a solid footing. My Government fully shares that view, which is why it has chosen to emphasize its cooperation in these fields -- fields which will make it possible to build the future.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, it is increasingly evident that the restoration of democracy cannot come about without economic development. That is why we welcome the wise decision of the Secretary-General to bring such interaction into play from the very outset of the operation in order to prepare harmoniously for the next, crucial phase -- the consolidation of peace.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ubalijoro</span> <span class="nation">Rwanda</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">My delegation is more than pleased with the positive ongoing operations of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), especially at a time when we are all thirsty for United Nations success stories.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">My delegation attributes the present success of UNMIH in part to the transparency exercised by UNMIH personnel in keeping the Special Representative of the Secretary-General informed about the state of Haitian public opinion as reflected in the local press and radio network. We believe that this approach somewhat encourages a climate of trust and cooperation between the United Nations system and the Haitian people, due to the fact that both sides work within a framework in which their respective responsibilities and competences are well defined.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">My delegation is also pleased by the fact that, since the transition from the multinational force to UNMIH, the security situation in Haiti has greatly improved, particulary in Port-au-Prince. My delegation would also like to pay tribute to the Haitian national security forces for having contributed to the relative security currently enjoyed by all Haitians.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">However, my delegation would like to stress the imperative need for the new members of the Haitian National Police to take up their duties in the country's cities and villages, as the present interim public security force becomes more assertive. For my delegation, it is of paramount importance for Haitians to regain their full sovereignty over all their territory as they assume the responsibility for law and order in their country.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">My delegation welcomes the United Nations project for the training of prosecutors in coordination with a USAID project to train Haitian lawyers at the Bordeaux Justice Academy in France. We believe indeed that personnel training and retraining are crucial to making the changes that are needed, such as a break with the cycle of impunity, in order to allow improvement in the performance of the judiciary.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">As members know, we welcomed the Security Council's decision to coordinate UNMIH's peace-keeping mission with development activities, a proposal to which my delegation attaches the utmost importance. As the restoration of constitutional order, dialogue and cooperation takes its course, my delegation looks forward to the establishment of a climate based on frank, concrete and constructive collaboration between the international community and the Government of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">On this matter, my delegation strongly hopes that cooperation activities in Haiti will move from emergency and ad hoc interventions to strategically planned, programmed and coordinated development interventions with a long-term perspective. In this connection, we call upon the moral authority of all international and non-governmental organizations and key multilateral institutions to work in close coordination with the local Haitian authorities in order to achieve these objectives, which will demonstrate their dedication, goodwill and commitment to helping a people that is desperately in need.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">My delegation would also like to commend the Paris Club creditors for having agreed to renegotiate Haiti's bilateral debt. The debt reduction that has been made in favour of Haiti will stimulate the economic growth of Haiti because it will partially decrease Haiti's reliance on international financial assistance intended for post-conflict relief, which is unfortunately often slow, thus accelerating Haiti's movement towards economic recovery. Such assistance is indeed ideal and it should be applied to all countries in post-conflict situations, because of the specific necessity for a longer process in the reinvigoration of their economies.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">Finally, we agree with the Secretary-General's observation on the need to sustain a secure and stable environment in order to promote the economic, social and institutional development necessary for a lasting restoration of democracy in Haiti. It is in for this reason that my delegation has voted to extend UNMIH's mandate for a period of seven months in order to enable a new, constitutionally elected Government fully to assume power in Haiti.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sidorov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">The Russian delegation notes that, as stated in the report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) has achieved significant progress in implementing the task entrusted to it, in particular as concerns providing a safe and secure environment in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">The first experience of democratic elections in Haiti, of course, was an important step towards the restoration of democracy in that State. At the same time, we note that 22 of the 27 political parties that took part in the elections said, in one way or another, that they had serious problems with the electoral process itself and with the way the votes were counted. In addition, 15 leading opposition parties decided not to participate at all in the elections. These facts should prompt the international community to continue very carefully to follow the development of the situation with a view to holding the next round of voting, and then the presidential elections.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">We share the view of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that in the long term, one of the key factors for the stabilization of the political situation and the security of Haiti will be the consolidation and the gradual improvement of the social and economic situation in the country. The international community must offer assistance to this end.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">We wish to stress that the main responsibility for the fate of the country lies with the Government and the people of Haiti. We hope that President Aristide, the Government of Haiti and the leaders of the political parties will learn from the mistakes made in the conduct of previous elections and will take all necessary steps to redress these mistakes in the subsequent electoral process. This process must ensure that by February 1996, when the United Nations operation in that country will come to an end, the establishment of democratically elected institutions and a proper security system.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Honduras.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">My delegation received with satisfaction the Secretary-General's report on the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). We believe that the progress made by UNMIH in the short time since it assumed its functions is extremely significant.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">It is commendable that it has been possible, in cooperation with the Organization of American States (OAS) Electoral Observation Mission and the International Civilian Mission (MICIVIH), to create the right environment for the holding, on 25 June, of municipal elections and the first round of the legislative elections.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">My delegation also believes that it is a positive sign that, thanks to the presence and the activities of UNMIH, the security situation in Haiti has improved. However, we do agree with what the Secretary-General states in his report and with the Council's presidential statement of 24 April this year to the effect that although UNMIH's presence is intended to assist the Haitian Government in establishing a secure and stable environment, the early deployment of a permanent and effective independent police force in Haiti is a key element for the long-term stability of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">Accordingly, we support the expansion of the Haitian National Police force, because this will to a great extent help to strengthen democracy and to revitalize the Haitian justice system.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">We recognize the importance of sustaining a stable and secure environment in Haiti, as well as the need to bolster its social and democratic institutions.
