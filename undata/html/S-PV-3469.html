<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">Under the item on its agenda, the Security Council will now begin its consideration of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members concerning the application of the Republic of Palau for admission to membership in the United Nations, which appears in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1356.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1356</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">In paragraph 3 of the report the Committee recommends to the Council that it should have recourse to the provision of the last paragraph of rule 60 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure in order to present its recommendation to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. If I hear no objection I shall take it that the Council wishes to waive the time limits set forth in the penultimate paragraph of rule 60.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">In paragraph 4 of the report the Committee recommends to the Security Council the adoption of a draft resolution on the application of the Republic of Palau for admission to membership in the United Nations. I should like to congratulate the Committee on its unanimous decision to recommend that the Republic of Palau be admitted to membership in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">In accordance with the understanding reached in prior consultations among members of the Council, I propose that the Council adopt the draft resolution contained in paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">As I see no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">I therefore declare that the draft resolution contained in paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1356.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1356</a>) has been adopted without a vote as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-963(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 963 (1994)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">I shall immediately convey the decision of the Security Council recommending the admission of the Republic of Palau to membership in the United Nations to the Secretary-General for transmittal to the General Assembly in accordance with rule 60 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">I shall now make a statement, in my capacity as President of the Security Council, on behalf of the members of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"In my capacity as President of the Security Council and on behalf of the members of the Council, I would like to underscore the historic importance of the resolution we have just adopted recommending the admission of the Republic of Palau to membership in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"This resolution marks the culmination of an effort sustained over decades to bring self-determination to the Trust Territories in different corners of the world. That successful effort has enabled the peoples of the Trust Territories to take charge of their destiny and assume the place to which they are entitled in the community of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"This resolution also serves to remind us of the importance to the United Nations of the principle of universality under which all States -- large and small -- contribute to our common goal of a peaceful and prosperous international community of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">"As a Member of the United Nations, the Republic of Palau will help put that principle into practice and make its own important contribution to achieving the goals of our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">"On behalf of the members of the Security Council, I congratulate the Republic of Palau on the decision which the Council has adopted, recommending to the General Assembly its admission to membership in the United Nations."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-73.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/73</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">The Council has thus concluded its consideration of the matter before it.</p>
