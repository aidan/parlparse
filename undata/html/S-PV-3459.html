	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the following documents: <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1288.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1288</a>, letter dated 13 November 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Iraq to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, transmitting the text of a letter dated 12 November 1994 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq addressed to the Secretary-General; and <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1291.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1291</a>, letter dated 13 November 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Kuwait to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council has received the letter addressed to the President of the Security Council by the Foreign Minister of Iraq dated 12 November 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1288.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1288</a>), enclosing copies of Revolution Command Council Decision No. 200 of 10 November 1994, signed by its President, Mr. Saddam Hussein, and the Declaration of the Iraqi National Assembly, also of 10 November 1994, which confirm Iraq's irrevocable and unqualified recognition of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the State of Kuwait, and of the international boundary between the Republic of Iraq and the State of Kuwait as demarcated by the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission, and confirm Iraq's respect for the inviolability of that boundary, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-833(1993).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 833 (1993)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes this development and the President of the Security Council has written to the Permanent Representative of Iraq accordingly, in a letter dated 16 November 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1297.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1297</a>). The Council notes that Iraq has taken this action in compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-833(1993).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 833 (1993)</a> and has unequivocally committed itself by full and formal constitutional procedures to respect Kuwait's sovereignty, territorial integrity and borders, as required by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 687 (1991)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-833(1993).pdf" class="pdf">833 (1993)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-949(1994).pdf" class="pdf">949 (1994)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council considers this decision by Iraq to be a significant step in the direction towards implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. In the above-mentioned letter, the President of the Security Council informed the Government of Iraq that the members of the Security Council will follow closely Iraq's implementation of its decision; they will also continue to keep under review Iraq's actions to complete its compliance with all the relevant Security Council resolutions."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-68.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/68</a>.</p>
