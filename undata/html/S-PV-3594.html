<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The statement is as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">"The Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General of 6 November 1995 on the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-922.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/922</a>), issued pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1007(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1007 (1995)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council commends UNMIH on the substantial progress it has made towards fulfilling its mandate, as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>, to assist the Government of Haiti in sustaining a secure and stable environment, protecting international personnel and key installations, establishing the conditions for holding elections and creating a new professional police force. The Council commends the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, and other dedicated personnel of the United Nations who have contributed to this effort.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">The Security Council also commends the Government of Haiti for holding local and legislative elections in a peaceful and non-violent environment, and notes the recent convocation of the special session of the National Assembly and its approval of the new Cabinet and plan of government. The Council notes with satisfaction the role of UNMIH and the joint United Nations/Organization of American States (OAS) International Civilian Mission (MICIVIH) in assisting the Haitian authorities with the electoral process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council emphasizes that the continued engagement and commitment of all Haitian parties is necessary to the successful organization of free, fair and peaceful presidential elections. Consistent with the objectives of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 940 (1994)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1007(1995).pdf" class="pdf">1007 (1995)</a>, the Council welcomes the announcement by the provisional Electoral Council of presidential elections scheduled for 17 December 1995 that should allow a transition of power to a duly-elected successor before UNMIH's scheduled termination on 29 February 1996. The holding of presidential elections on schedule is a crucial step in consolidating long-lasting democracy in Haiti and ensuring a smooth transition of government. The Council calls on all political parties in Haiti to participate in the forthcoming elections, and to contribute actively to maintain the secure and stable conditions necessary for their conduct.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council notes with concern recent instances of violence in Haiti and calls for respect for the rule of law, national reconciliation and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Government and people of Haiti bear the primary responsibility for Haiti's political, economic and social reconstruction. The Security Council underlines its firm support for the progress Haiti has already made in this regard. The Council emphasizes that a sustained commitment by the international community is indispensable for long-term peace and stability in Haiti. In this regard the Council encourages the Haitian Government to continue its dialogue with the international financial institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council shares the view of the Secretary-General that the establishment of a professional police force capable of maintaining law and order throughout the country is central to Haiti's long-term stability. As the end of UNMIH's mandate approaches, attention should be focused on the selection and training of the Haitian National Police supervisors and on interested Member States providing the police force with the necessary equipment.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council also supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to streamline UNMIH, including the CIVPOL component.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council expresses its confidence that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, UNMIH and UN/OAS MICIVIH will continue to assist the Government and people of Haiti. It notes in particular the useful role played by</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">the OAS and the valuable cooperation with Haiti of interested Member States on a bilateral basis and stresses the importance of continuing such cooperation. The Council requests that the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Friends of Haiti and the Haitian authorities, report to the Council, at the appropriate time, on next steps in the areas of security, law enforcement and humanitarian assistance, including by United Nations specialized agencies and programmes, which the international community may take to help Haiti achieve a long-term future that is secure, stable and free."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-55.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/55</a>.</p>
