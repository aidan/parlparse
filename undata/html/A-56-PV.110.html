The African Union was born on 9 July 2002, with the praiseworthy objectives enshrined in the Constitutive Act. The African Union will rely on its own potentials to attain those objectives, and, in particular, on the sincere cooperation that should exist with its partners. We hope that cooperation will be very fruitful.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kumalo</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Today is indeed a historic day for us from the African continent, as the Organization of African Unity is being replaced in this Hall by the African Union. I have the pleasure to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.84.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/56/L.84</a>. I would like to begin by stating that in addition to the sponsors that appear on the draft resolution -- Azerbaijan, Belgium, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt and South Africa -- this draft resolution is also sponsored by the following countries: Algeria, Austria, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Kuwait, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">This draft resolution dates back to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-218.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 56/218</a>, of 21 December 2001, in which it was decided that a high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly would be held on 16 September 2002 to consider how to support the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). At the time that resolution was discussed, there was a possibility of our having two days for this high-level event. But, following consultations and negotiations, 16 September is the only day that we have for the high-level event in support of NEPAD.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Because of the fact that this is to be a one-day event, we have faced the tremendous challenge of trying to accommodate all Member States wishing to participate in the debate that will be held on 16 September 2002. In the end, we have come up with a draft resolution that we believe enjoys consensus among many Member States. The draft resolution would decide to hold a high-level meeting on 16 September 2002 to consider how to support the New Partnership for Africa's Development. That session would consist of two plenary meetings, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Together with those two plenary meetings, there would also be a separate informal panel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The speakers' list for the debate in the plenary meetings shall be organized on a first-come-first-served basis, and the order of precedence shall be heads of State or Government, vice-presidents, crown princes and princesses, deputy prime ministers, the highest-ranking officials of the Holy See and Switzerland -- in their capacities as observer States -- Palestine -- in its capacity as an Observer -- ministers, vice-ministers, chairmen of delegations and everyone else representing their country. However, because it is to be a one-day meeting, we decided to adopt a formula that would ensure that we could take advantage of the presence of heads of State or Government who will be here for the fifty-seventh session, as well as of the ministers expected to attend the session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">In addition, if I may digress for a moment, the speakers' list will not be open until 10 September, in order to be fair to many of our colleagues who are not here or who are or who are on vacation. That will allow us to open up the speakers' list with everyone in town, so that no one will have an added advantage or disadvantage.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The draft resolution would also decide that the informal panel would be held parallel with the afternoon plenary meeting, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. The panel's theme would be "The international community's partnership with the New Partnership for Africa's Development". The draft resolution would further decide that the informal panel would be made up of five panellists, namely, the heads of State of the five initiating countries of the New Partnership for Africa's Development: the Presidents of Nigeria, South Africa, Algeria, Senegal and Egypt. The draft resolution would further decide that, at the end of the debate in the plenary meetings, the Head of State of Nigeria would orally present to the General Assembly a summary of the discussion in the informal panel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The formula we have come up with is one that we believe suits the concerns and needs of many delegations. We ask the Assembly to endorse it by consensus.</p>
