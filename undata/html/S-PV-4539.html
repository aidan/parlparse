	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the elections held in Sierra Leone on 14 May 2002. It congratulates the people of Sierra Leone on the peaceful and orderly way in which the elections were held. It commends the National Electoral Commission and all those responsible for the successful management of the elections, and commends UNAMSIL for their invaluable supporting role. The Council notes that the various electoral observation groups were impressed by the Sierra Leonean people's commitment to democracy and their determination to vote. The Council calls on all political parties and their supporters to work together to strengthen democracy and thereby assure continuing peace.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council considers the elections an important milestone on the road to peace and security in Sierra Leone and the Mano River region. The next challenge for Sierra Leone and the international community is the further consolidation of peace. There is much still to do, including the extension of public services to make real the restoration of government authority throughout the country, the further enhancement of the operational effectiveness of the security sector, and the effective reintegration of all ex-combatants. A sustained effort from the international community will be needed to achieve our shared objective of sustainable peace and security, which must be the basis for Sierra Leone's economic regeneration and future development. The Council urges all donors to contribute generously towards these ends, including by providing urgently needed funds to the Special Court and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council will continue to pay close attention to developments in Sierra Leone and the Mano River region. The Council requests the Secretary-General to monitor the situation there closely and to keep the Council informed of any significant developments."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-14.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/14</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
