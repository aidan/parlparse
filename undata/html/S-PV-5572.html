	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"On 30 October 2006, the Security Council heard Mr. Elie Doté, Prime Minister of the Central African Republic, as well as General Lamine Cissé, Special Representative of the Secretary-General. It reiterated its full support for the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA) and for the United Nations staff in the Central African Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the Government's efforts to revive dialogue through meetings with political stakeholders and representatives of civil society. It calls upon the Secretary-General to encourage, through BONUCA, the holding on a regular basis of such meetings, which are vital to restoring trust among Central Africans and promoting lasting reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council also welcomes the courageous efforts of the Government to implement the reforms advocated by the bilateral partners and international financial institutions aimed at improving the management of the national treasury, ensuring transparency in economic activities and good governance. In that regard, it calls upon the Central African Government to continue the reforms and dialogue with its international partners with a view to restoring economic growth and reducing poverty in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council is deeply concerned about the deterioration of the security situation in the Central African Republic, especially in the wake of the attacks on the towns of Birao, Ouanda-Djalle and Sam Ouandja. It expresses serious concern that instability along the border areas of Chad, Sudan and the Central African Republic represents a threat to security and stability in the Central African Republic and its neighbours, while noting that Central African defence and security forces are still unable to repel the armed groups in the northern and north-eastern parts of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the territorial integrity of the Central African Republic. It calls for the adoption of a subregional approach to stabilize the borders of the Central African Republic. It urges the Central African authorities to expedite their efforts to restructure the armed forces and enhance their operational capabilities, and encourages the Multinational Force of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (FOMUC) to continue supporting the Central African armed forces beyond 30 June 2007. It notes that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has dispatched a fact-finding mission to Chad and the Central African Republic to assess how the United Nations might help those countries address the current instability. The Security Council looks forward to the findings and recommendations of the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to reinforce cooperation between the United Nations and member States of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) with a view to facilitating and strengthening initiatives aimed at addressing trans-border insecurity in the subregion and bringing to an end the violations by armed groups of the territorial integrity of the Central African Republic. It also requests the Secretary-General to provide to it a report on the situation in the Central African Republic by 31 December 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council decides to renew the mandate of BONUCA for a period of one year, until 31 December 2007, and invites the Secretary-General to submit to it the new modalities of the mission of BONUCA for the new period no later than 30 November 2006."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-47.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/47</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
