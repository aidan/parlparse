	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">First of all, I wish to join my colleagues in the Council in congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month. I am confident that, with your wisdom, talent and wealth of experience, you will surely provide excellent guidance to the work of the Council for this month. I would also like to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Gambari, for his outstanding performance and effective work, which led to the successful conclusion of the work of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">Since the conflict started in Yemen on 5 May this year, the flames of war have spread wider and wider, leading to huge losses of innocent life and of property. The Chinese delegation expresses its great anxiety and concern over these developments. We urge all those concerned to cease fighting and all hostile actions forthwith, give up the use of force and resume negotiations as soon as possible so as to seek an appropriate solution by peaceful means.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">The Chinese delegation has always maintained that all conflicts should be settled peacefully through negotiation, and we oppose resolving political disputes by force. We sincerely hope that the armed conflict will be brought to an early end and that peace and stability will be restored. It is based on this consistent position that the Chinese delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">We have noted that in the course of resolving the conflict the countries concerned in the region, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the League of Arab States have all made unswerving efforts, which we welcome. We hope that the countries and organizations concerned in the region will continue to play an active role of mediation in helping all those concerned to resolve their disputes by peaceful means, thus bringing the war to an early end and restoring peace and tranquillity for the Yemeni people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">Finally, it must be emphasized that, in its consideration of any issue of concern, the Security Council should respect the relevant views of the countries or parties concerned. It is our view that the consideration of the situation of the Republic of Yemen by the Council under the current special circumstances should not constitute a precedent for the handling of other similar issues.</p>
