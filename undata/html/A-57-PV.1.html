<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk03">
<span class="speaker" name="The President" nation="" language="">
	The President
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa01">It is a great honour and privilege for me to assume the presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly today. Let me thank you, members of the Assembly for the trust and confidence you have extended to my country and myself. I would like to assure you that I will do my best to perform all my functions and tasks effectively and with full understanding of the concerns of each Member State, as well as of the interests of the United Nations membership as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa02">At the outset, let me express sincere gratitude to my esteemed predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Under his able leadership, you have all made the previous session successful in many areas. I personally highly value the fact that under his guidance an entirely new procedure of transition between General Assembly presidencies was established. The newly adopted rules for the election of the President and the General Committee several months ahead constitute an important achievement that will enable all future General Assembly Presidents to assume their responsibilities in a smoother, better organized and more efficient way.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa03">The Czech Republic has always emphasized the indispensable role the Organization plays in maintaining international peace and security, enhancing economic, development and humanitarian cooperation, and promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Over the years, we have served the Organization in many ways, working in various governing bodies in intergovernmental processes and participating in development cooperation and in peacekeeping operations all over the world. I therefore assume the General Assembly presidency with a great sense of responsibility and commitment to contribute, in my own modest personal capacity, to further strengthening the role of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa04">Allow me to share our priorities for the work of the fifty-seventh session. As we commemorate the tragic events of 11 September 2001, we must remain focused on the fight against international terrorism and uphold our international coalition. The strengthening of United Nations instruments, including the set of international treaties to combat terrorism, should be central to the efforts of the international community. In this respect, I highly commend the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, which has greatly contributed to the implementation of the historic Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. For the part of the General Assembly, we still have an important task to resolve. We lack a general convention against terrorism -- including a definition of international terrorism -- and I strongly urge Member States to proceed with their work in the ad hoc Working Group of the Sixth Committee on that issue. I am ready to take an active part in all United Nations efforts to combat international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa05">It is also crucial to continue our work in the area of conflict prevention. Recent experience suggests that certain conflicts can be prevented through preventive diplomacy, preventive deployment and preventive disarmament. The far-reaching recommendations of the Secretary-General's report on the prevention of armed conflict (<a href="../pdf/A-55-985.pdf">A/55/985</a>) serve as a guide to enhance the preventive capacity of the United Nations and to move from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention. Successful preventive strategies should include accountability and good governance, respect for human rights, promotion of social and economic development, and programmes aimed at attaining disarmament, education and gender equality.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa06">The need for an effective strategy for conflict prevention is underlined by the number of existing conflicts troubling today's world. One of the most protracted of those conflicts is the Middle East conflict. International efforts to bring peace to the area, on both a bilateral and an international basis, have intensified in the past decade. Since its establishment, the United Nations has been actively involved in numerous efforts to resolve the conflict, most recently as one of the players in the "quartet" initiative. There is a growing hope that the "quartet" has the necessary potential to slow down the vicious spiral of violence and to bring new prospects for a peaceful settlement to the parties in the conflict. During our deliberations at the General Assembly, I would like to contribute, to the extent possible, to the existing efforts to find a political resolution to this conflict.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa07">Other issues of great importance that I plan to follow closely include poverty eradication, the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the role of sustainable development in the accelerating process of globalization. The Millennium Summit was a remarkable milestone in our endeavour to explore ways to achieve a more equal distribution of the benefits of globalization. We believe that the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly is the session in which the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus and the outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development should be duly addressed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa08">The Millennium Declaration laid out the set of development goals that have been widely accepted as targets for development cooperation. In Monterrey, substantial progress was achieved in the area of financing for development, bringing a number of recommendations to national Governments, local authorities and international institutions. The Monterrey Consensus itself gave us guidance on how to change our work in the United Nations in order to achieve better coherence and efficiency. We will also have to improve cooperation among the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Assembly's Main Committees.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa09">The fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly will face the very important and challenging task of preparing for the high-level dialogue in 2003 as a follow up to the Monterrey Consensus. Building global partnerships for development is a key to its success. During my time in office I will pay special attention to closer cooperation between the United Nations and major stakeholders, namely the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, as well as other multilateral institutions, representatives of the private sector, and of course, civil society.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa10">At the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, Governments reaffirmed their commitment to the achievement of sustainable development. After lengthy and uneasy negotiations, Governments endorsed a plan of implementation that contains at least some specific targets, timetables and ways to alleviate poverty and protect the environment. In addition, more than 220 partnerships representing $235 million in resources, were introduced at the Summit in Johannesburg to complement Government commitments.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa11">I am aware that the World Summit did not meet all the expectations of all the people, but I am confident that the compromise reached will enable the United Nations to come up with mechanisms that would be instrumental in timely implementation of the commitments made in Johannesburg.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa12">As President of the General Assembly, I will support an early follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development. My attention will be focused also on regional initiatives, such as the New Partnership for Africa's Development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa13">Although I am aware that there is no direct causal link between poverty and terrorism, at the same time I am convinced that extreme poverty is one of the important ingredients which, combined with others such as unresolved long-term political conflicts, could potentially produce an explosive cocktail. At the very least, this can lead to a feeling of powerlessness, frustration and anger, which can create fertile soil for fundamentalist, radical or even terrorist behaviour.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa14">I believe, therefore, that we have to implement the millennium development goals and fight poverty, not only for moral and humanitarian reasons, but also as an integral part of the fight against terrorism and extreme intolerance of all kinds -- as part of our struggle for a stable, secure and more just world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa15">I am convinced that, for anyone who truly understands the meaning of international solidarity -- and let me stress that I have in mind ordinary human solidarity -- the fight against poverty and for human dignity is a task which has to be tackled. There is no option of doing nothing or even doing less than our utmost.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa16">Over the past two months I have had the opportunity to consult with some members on questions of United Nations reform. I have heard a clear message: we should make the work of the General Assembly more dynamic, lively and efficient. I plan to build on the achievements of my predecessors, Mr. Harri Holkeri and Mr. Han Seung-soo, and continue the work on the revitalization of the General Assembly. I intend to hold panel discussions on issues of common interest and informal consultations on items that require more information and interactive dialogue. In that regard, I rely on the active involvement of all members.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa17">I want to further improve the working methods of the General Assembly by streamlining its agenda. In this regard we have already achieved some modest progress. For the first time ever, in a close and effective cooperation with the Secretariat, a draft programme of work for the entire main part of the fifty-seventh session was provided to Member States several weeks before the beginning of the session. In this programme, agenda items have been entrusted, allowing for joint or consequent debate on interlinked issues.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa18">The support of Member States for this proposal could help eliminate repetitive speeches and create better preconditions for more complex consideration of interrelated and cross-cutting issues. In that connection, I would like to inform the Assembly of my strong intention to fully utilize the time allocated for our meetings, including by starting our work punctually. In chairing the meetings I am determined to adhere to the agreed time limits of speeches, and also in this respect, I hope to gain the support and full cooperation of members.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa19">I look forward to the outcome of the ongoing work of the Secretariat on the enhancement of its effectiveness, as part of the implementation of the road map. I am convinced that this initiative, combined with the efforts on the revitalization of the General Assembly, could result in more profound changes that would make the United Nations truly efficient.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa20">As the Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group on Security Council reform, I will do my utmost to facilitate discussion to bring Member States closer to an agreement. I would like to reiterate that a more representative Security Council reflecting the changed realities of today's world should be in the interest of Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa21">I would like to commend the Secretariat for the assistance provided so far to my office and me. Let me also express my hope that this kind of constructive cooperation will continue throughout the entire fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa22">Allow me a very brief concluding reflection. We all come from different parts of the world, bringing with us diverse backgrounds, skills, knowledge and approaches. The diversity of our views and cultures makes our discussions rich and powerful, sometimes even dramatic. On the other hand, we all have a lot in common, particularly our desire to live in a peaceful and secure world where the values and principles expressed in the United Nations Charter are fully honoured. I would like to plead with all members to work during the upcoming session in a spirit of partnership and solidarity. Let open discussion, mutual understanding and tolerance as well as constructive cooperation govern our deliberations. I wish all of us a fruitful and productive session.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa01">In accordance with Article 4 of the Charter, and following the adoption of Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1426(2002).pdf">resolution 1426 (2002)</a> of 24 July 2002, which recommends to the General Assembly that the Swiss Confederation be admitted to membership in the United Nations, it is my honour, on behalf of the five friendly countries neighbouring it, to recommend to the Assembly the adoption of the draft resolution to admit Switzerland to membership of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa02">We warmly welcome the admission of Switzerland to the United Nations. We do so, of course, because of the bonds that unite our two countries. But we do so also, and in particular, because Switzerland's membership will strengthen the United Nations and the values on which the Organization must build the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa03">Geography has made Switzerland and France neighbours; history has made us allies and friends. In 1430, my country opened a diplomatic mission in Switzerland. While many conflicts have caused much bloodshed in Europe throughout the centuries, our countries have enjoyed peaceful relations since 1515.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa04">On a number of occasions during crucial times in our history, Switzerland opened its doors to us. That tradition of Switzerland as a land of exile goes back a long way. How could we forget that in the seventeenth century it gave refuge to many French people fleeing religious persecution? Even then, when intransigence was often the rule and being different was often punished by death, Switzerland was a model of openness, tolerance and peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa05">The bonds that unite us today are strong, close and characterized by unfailing trust. Our dialogue is an ongoing one. Our two countries are also major actors in the French-speaking community. But Switzerland's outreach extends to the whole world. At the beginning of the twentieth century, it hosted the very first efforts to create a responsible, fraternal international community. Geneva became the other main headquarters of the United Nations and home to some 15 specialized agencies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa06">Switzerland will now be able to bring to the United Nations all of the qualities that we identify with it. As a founding Member of the United Nations, and because we are committed to strengthening the Organization, France is profoundly pleased by this. Switzerland's standards and practices go right to the heart of the values that unite us.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa07">Switzerland is the only State to have joined the United Nations following a referendum. Its system of direct democracy, which was worked out over the centuries through the patient work of some of the greatest jurists, will strengthen the democratic premise of our Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa08">Its multicultural character and its multilingualism will make a crucial contribution to the dialogue among civilizations that is now so essential the community of States, particularly since, in addition to its wealth of cultural resources, Switzerland has traditionally been a land of refuge for great artists, including Charlie Chaplin, Nabokov and Balthus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa09">The role played by Switzerland in development, international law and humanitarian issues is crucial. Who could forget that the founder of the Red Cross, Henri Dunant, was Swiss? The historic decision taken by the Swiss Confederation will now enable it, with respect for its neutrality, to enjoy new opportunities for action and influence. It will now be able to bring its full potential to bear in carrying out the tasks entrusted to it by the United Nations: ensuring peace, security and the prosperity of humankind.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk10-pa10">France is therefore particularly happy and proud to stand beside Switzerland at this crucial time in its history.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk06-pa01">First of all, I should like to say that it is an honour and a pleasure to represent the Group of African States before the Assembly on the occasion of the admission of the Swiss Confederation to the United Nations as a full-fledged Member State, and to welcome the presence of the Swiss delegation, led by His Excellency Mr. Kaspar Villiger, President of the Swiss Confederation. I should also like to convey the warmest congratulations of the African Group to the Government and the people of Switzerland on their historic decision to give that important country of the international community the place that it deserves within the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk06-pa02">Finally, the African States, which all enjoy excellent relations with Switzerland, would like to tell the Swiss delegation, through me, how pleased they are to see it occupy at last the place that should have belonged to it long ago. Africans are aware of the role that Switzerland has played for many years in the defence and promotion of the ideals of the United Nations. Has it not, for decades, been the seat of important bodies and agencies of the Organization and of other international bodies that work for the promotion of peace, development and understanding among the peoples of the world?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk06-pa03">In the light of the foregoing, it was vital for us Africans that such a country become a full-fledged member of the United Nations family at the beginning of the twenty-first century, a time when the Organization needs fresh inspiration to rise to the numerous challenges that face it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk06-pa04">Switzerland should know that it can count on the readiness and the cooperation of the African Group of the United Nations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa01">It is a great honour and a privilege for me, acting in my capacity as the Chairman of the Asian Group, to congratulate the Swiss Confederation on its admission today to membership of the United Nations. We are profoundly glad to welcome to this Hall the Swiss delegation, whose presence here has further enhanced the universality of the Organization. We welcome Switzerland as a new member of the United Nations family. There have always been very close links between the United Nations and Switzerland, which has -- among many other things, and among its many contributions to the work of the Organization -- graciously offered its hospitality to the European Headquarters of the United Nations as well as to numerous other international organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa02">As a democratic and multicultural society, Switzerland represents the true spirit of the United Nations and a best model for dialogue among civilizations. It attaches great importance to the promotion of international law, and it has a history of offering its good offices and of supporting international peace efforts, contributing military observers and civilian personnel to United Nations peacekeeping operations. Switzerland is renowned for its long humanitarian tradition, and it has been a significant contributor to the efforts of the United Nations in the fields of development cooperation and humanitarian assistance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa03">We are convinced that Switzerland's membership of the United Nations is important not only for Switzerland itself, but also for the Organization's membership as a whole. Active and full participation by Switzerland in the activities of the United Nations will certainly enable us to make more effective use of the Organization's potential to promote the establishment of peace and security and to pursue the goals and objectives enshrined in the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa04">I would like to express our best wishes to the Swiss Confederation on this significant event and to wish the Government and the people of Switzerland continued peace and prosperity. The States Member of the Asian Group look forward to working closely with Switzerland in all spheres of the activities of the United Nations.</div>

Our Organization is meant to be universal. Today, the principle of universality has moved one step closer towards its full realization. The admission of Switzerland to the family of nations also enhances the legitimacy and effectiveness of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk04-pa02">Despite the fact that Switzerland officially joins the United Nations only today, we have always considered it to be a great partner deeply involved in United Nations activities. I refer here not only to its participation in numerous United Nations bodies, special agencies and various programmes of the Organization; everyone knows Geneva as one of the major United Nations centres of the world, a family hearth for a number of international agencies and organizations. For my country, Switzerland has always served as a bright example of a tolerant, peaceful and multicultural society built on democratic values. We are confident that its membership in the United Nations will be of benefit to the people of Switzerland, who made their historic choice in a March referendum. It will be of benefit to our Organization and to the peoples of the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk04-pa03">Let me warmly welcome the Swiss Confederation, congratulate the Group of Western European and Other States -- which has gained such a good player for its team -- and wish our new Member every success in its future United Nations endeavours.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa02">To be admitted to the family of nations in the midst of the developments in today's world is of extreme importance; given the awareness and convictions of all partners in this body that we still have a long way to go to realize the most noble goals and objectives of the United Nations regarding human rights, the dignity of our peoples, tolerance, social and economic progress, international peace and security, sustainable human development and, especially, the outcomes of the most recent major conferences in Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg, which are in conformity with the very essential millennium development goals and have given us tools on the basis of which alone we, the States Members of the United Nations, shall be able to make the necessary difference in the lives of our peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa03">The newly admitted nation of the Swiss Confederation is very well known, inter alia, because of its important and essential role in the protection and promotion of human rights and the promotion and strengthening of humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles through, amongst others, the widely known and respected International Committee of the Red Cross. We may therefore expect an essential contribution from our new Member regarding the implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and the millennium development goals and towards the fulfilment of our national and international responsibilities and duties.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa04">The admission of the new Member State has therefore to be considered a great, valuable and challenging addition to our work in the United Nations. All the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States are ready to cooperate with the new Member State constructively and in the best possible way.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Furthermore, allow me, on behalf of all the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, to welcome most heartily our new, respected Member, the Swiss Confederation, as the 190th State Member of our Organization because of its well-known democratic, neutral, multicultural and multilingual nature. Let me also, on behalf of our Group, congratulate the people, Government and delegation of Switzerland at this special moment.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk04-pa02">On 3 March 2002, the Swiss people decided to take a step forward to build on its already strong history of 54 years as an observer and host to some of the most important institutions of the United Nations. The presence here today of the President, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and several prominent members of Parliament reaffirms the strong commitment and importance given to the United Nations by Switzerland and its desire to remain a mainstay of this Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk04-pa03">The United Nations is a unique Organization in which the sovereignty of its Member States, the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are enshrined. These principles lie also at the heart of the Swiss Confederation. We can rest assured that Switzerland will continue to participate actively in negotiations for the improvement of our societies and the human condition at large, as it has done for so many years. I am sure that its new status will add vigour to its already important role within the context of our work here at the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk04-pa04">We, the members of the Group of Western European and other States, look forward to a continued and closer working relationship with our Swiss friends and colleagues, who are staunch defenders of the ideas and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. As the Swiss flag is raised this afternoon before the Assembly, the world will witness the strengthening of the United Nations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa02">It is a great honour to welcome Switzerland as the newest Member of the United Nations. Switzerland joins the United Nations as a modern democracy and as a European State with a record of active participation in regional forums dedicated to peace, security, democracy and human rights. Switzerland has shown its commitment to multilateral cooperation through its role in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Partnership for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Council. It has also deepened its relationship with the European Union and the Council of Europe.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The decision of the Swiss people to join the United Nations is testimony to their confidence in their nation and in its ability to contribute to the wider world. Switzerland's deepening involvement in Europe and its role in peacekeeping in the Balkans and in Sudan, as well as the invaluable work of the International Committee of the Red Cross, all highlight the country's unique contributions to making the world a safer and better place. So we warmly welcome Switzerland to this meeting house of nations with every confidence that those contributions will continue.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa01">It is a great pleasure for me, on this historic occasion, to welcome, on behalf of the General Assembly, the Swiss Confederation as a new Member of the United Nations. The admission of the Swiss Confederation into the family of nations is of great significance, as it sanctions the universality of the United Nations and thus enhances its legitimacy and effectiveness.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa02">There have been close relations and good cooperation between the Swiss Confederation and the United Nations. As a country with a long and deeply rooted tradition of democracy, the Swiss Confederation makes a great contribution to the development of international cooperation in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. Let me remind members at this historic moment that it was the Swiss Confederation that was the host country of the League of Nations after the First World War. Moreover, it is the Swiss Confederation that is the host country of the human rights section of the United Nations, especially the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa03">In our mind, Geneva is connected also to the International Committee of the Red Cross as one of the bodies that targets for improvement the conditions of people in difficulty during armed conflicts, as well as during natural or social disasters. Geneva is also well known as the birthplace of many international humanitarian conventions. However, I firmly believe that the decision of the Swiss Confederation to become a Member of the United Nations reflects the will and the aspiration of the Government and the people of the Swiss Confederation to further enhance cooperation with other Member States within the intergovernmental processes of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa04">I congratulate the Swiss Confederation, and I congratulate the United Nations on the admission of its 190th Member State. I am confident that this newly admitted Member State will contribute to the efforts of the General Assembly and of the United Nations in addressing the issues in international relations that lie ahead.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa01">On 3 March 2002, the Swiss people decided by popular vote to join the United Nations. Today the General Assembly has accepted our application for membership. First, I am proud that the Assembly has admitted Switzerland to such an important organization. I am also proud of the fact that I can affirm, on behalf of the Swiss people, our desire to join the United Nations. This day means a great deal to Switzerland. Because our country brings together four cultures and four national languages -- German, French, Italian and Rhaeto-Romansh -- I will take the liberty of addressing the Assembly in three of those languages.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa02">First, I wish to thank all the members of the General Assembly for welcoming the Swiss Confederation to the United Nations. My thanks also go particularly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, as well as to our neighbouring countries and to all the States that submitted or sponsored the draft resolution on our membership. I also thank the representatives of the regional groups and the host country for their kind words. Finally, the Secretary-General deserves our recognition and heartfelt thanks for his tireless efforts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa03">The United Nations is needed now more than ever. The persistence of global differences in degrees of wealth are not acceptable. Peace remains merely a dream in too many regions of the world. Too many conflicts are addressed through violence, instead of through legal means. All these factors force millions to flee their countries. Terrorism has become a global threat. The ecological balance of much of the planet is in jeopardy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa04">The world's fate depends on how we respond to those problems. Those problems are the responsibility of us all. A single country, no matter how large, does not have the capacity to resolve them. It is in the interest of us all that a universal organization should take up these challenges, and that organization can only be the United Nations. That is why the United Nations is so important for humanity. We were aware of that before we became a Member. That is why for many years we have played an active role in United Nations institutions. The Swiss people have always supported that participation. A longstanding partnership has arisen from that, while, as an Observer State, we have already practised the good-neighbourliness that is called for in the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa05">However, we struggled with the question of full United Nations membership. Many of my fellow citizens were torn. On the one hand, justice, peace and solidarity are defining values both for our own democracy and for the United Nations. The preambles to the United Nations Charter and to the Swiss Constitution express a commitment to these values. Our foreign policy aims correspond to the aims of the United Nations. We have always been proud and grateful for the fact that Geneva is a seat of the United Nations. We have always known the importance of international law, particularly for a small State with few instruments of power. And we know that the United Nations ultimately represents the indispensable means by which to attempt to contain power through law. All of these facts were in favour of membership.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa06">But many Swiss had doubts. They wondered whether the United Nations was truly in a position to achieve its noble aims. For many, the right of veto of the Security Council permanent members was not compatible with their understanding of democracy. They also feared that membership of the United Nations could prejudice the neutrality that is deeply rooted in our people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa07">(<i>spoke in German; English text furnished by the delegation</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa08">Switzerland is a country brought together by a common will, but it does not possess the unifying force of a common culture or language. National cohesion is, therefore, not to be taken for granted. Its central element is our system of direct democracy and the right of the people to decide all important political issues at the ballot box. It was therefore self-evident that only the people could take the decision on United Nations membership. Following an intensive and controversial debate within Switzerland, the people and the cantons voted in favour of membership. The Swiss people support the aims and efforts of the United Nations. Our representatives in the Organization will work constructively, but always in accordance with the wishes of the Swiss people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa09">In our application for membership of the United Nations, we made reference to Switzerland's neutrality. It is in its basic precept a rejection of war and violence as a means of resolving conflict. It has been a maxim of our foreign policy for centuries. At the same time, it has always served as an instrument of national cohesion. Our country of four cultures would quite possibly have disintegrated in periods of great European conflict had it not been for our neutrality. For all of these reasons, neutrality is of great importance to our people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa10">However, our neutrality is not self-serving. It does not close its eyes when confronted with injustice and poverty. It does not prevent us from raising our voice when injustice must be called by its name. Our neutrality is combined with solidarity, which is equally ingrained in our people. Switzerland will not participate in any peace enforcement operations, but it will be ready to help in peacekeeping or humanitarian tasks.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa11">(<i>spoke in French</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa12">On this, the eve of the first anniversary of the abhorrent terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, I would like to reaffirm that there has never been and never will be neutrality where terrorism and criminal acts are concerned. Consequently, Switzerland is actively involved in the fight against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa13">(<i>spoke in Italian; English text furnished by the delegation</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa14">Our work within the United Nations will be guided by our own central values: peace, democracy, dignity, neutrality and solidarity. We will do all we can for the protection of human rights and the dignity of humankind, even in hostile situations. We are committed to good governance, protection of the environment, sustainable development and conditions conducive to an open world economy. These are also the values and interests of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa15">(<i>spoke in French</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa16">Switzerland is a small country, but it gains strength from its centuries of independence and from its self-confidence. It will always make its voice heard, even when this could cause discomfort. But when it does so, it will always be in the interests of the values that I have mentioned. In all modesty, however, Switzerland is also aware of its limitations. If we are successful in making a contribution that advances the aims of the United Nations, if we are able to join in making a contribution to the building of a better world, then membership in the United Nations will have been worth it for us, too.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk08-pa17">It is a pleasure and an honour for me to declare that Switzerland is ready to take an active part in the work of the United Nations.</div>
