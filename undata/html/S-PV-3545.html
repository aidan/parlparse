	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-994(1995).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 994 (1995)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-467.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/467</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General of 9 June 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-467.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/467</a>) submitted pursuant to its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-994(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 994 (1995)</a> of 17 May 1995. It is concerned at the situation described therein, and at the continuing failure of the parties to cooperate satisfactorily with UNCRO and to comply fully with the demands of the Council. It condemns in particular the continuation of offensive actions and the intimidation of UNCRO personnel in violation of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-994(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 994 (1995)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council looks to the parties to cooperate fully and unconditionally with UNCRO in the performance of its mandate and to ensure the safety, security and freedom of movement of its personnel. The Council demands that they fulfil their commitment under the cease-fire agreement of 29 March 1994, in particular in respect of the withdrawal of all forces and heavy weapons from the zones of separation, and fully implement the 2 December 1994 agreement on economic confidence-building measures. It calls upon the parties, and in particular the Government of Croatia, to cease all military action in and around Sector South. It also calls upon all parties to respect fully the international border between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to stop any action which extends the conflict across this border, since this is in violation of the Council's resolutions. It reiterates its warning that in the event of failure to comply with the demand in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-994(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 994 (1995)</a> that the parties refrain from taking any further military measures or actions that could lead to the escalation of the situation, it will consider further steps needed to ensure such compliance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council requests the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-724(1991).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 724 (1991)</a> of 15 December 1991 to continue to investigate, in accordance with its mandate, reports of violations of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-713(1991).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 713 (1991)</a> of 25 September 1991.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the agreement of the Government of Croatia to a continued UNCRO presence in the area of Western Slavonia known as Sector West for the purposes of implementing its mandate, in particular in respect of human rights, to which it continues to attach great importance. It endorses the Secretary-General's view as to the necessity for reconciliation and confidence-building in that Sector. It stresses the importance it attaches to full respect for the human rights of the Serb population there. It encourages the Secretary-General to continue his coordination with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as other international organizations and agencies in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council notes the Secretary-General's judgement that completion of the redeployment of United Nations peace-keeping personnel in the Republic of Croatia by 30 June 1995 envisaged in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-982(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 982 (1995)</a> of 31 March 1995 is no longer possible. It requests the Secretary-General to proceed as expeditiously as possible with this redeployment with the aim of fulfilling all UNCRO's tasks under its mandate. It demands that the parties cooperate with UNCRO's efforts to implement fully its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council notes the fact that both parties have stated their desire that the peace-keeping mission should continue, and are seeking UNCRO's assistance. It welcomes the Secretary-General's intention to monitor closely their cooperation with UNCRO and their compliance with the cease-fire agreement of 29 March 1994, and requests him to keep the Council fully informed. Such cooperation and compliance are essential for the implementation of UNCRO's mandate and for progress towards a negotiated settlement respecting fully the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia and which guarantees the security and rights of all communities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council could not countenance moves by the local Serb authorities in the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to establish a union between them, since this would be inconsistent with the Council's commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council stresses that there can be no military solution to the conflict and calls upon the parties to reaffirm their commitment to a peaceful resolution of their differences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council notes with distress the loss of life and casualties which have been suffered by UNCRO and extends its condolences to the families of the bereaved.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council will remain seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-30.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/PRST/30</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
