	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council deplores the violence which occurred from 22 to 25 March in Kinshasa between the Congolese security forces and the security guards of Senator Jean-Pierre Bemba. It expresses its grave concern at the loss of lives, in particular of civilians, and urges all parties to respect the sanctity of human life and the principles of human rights. It also expresses its regret at the destruction and pillaging, including of some diplomatic missions, which took place during the clashes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council encourages the Congolese authorities and the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to undertake the necessary investigations into these events.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council emphasizes the legitimacy of the new democratically elected institutions and the need for these institutions to ensure the protection of the population. At the same time, it underlines the importance of these institutions operating with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, and avoiding any unnecessary or disproportionate use of force.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council regrets the use of violence, instead of dialogue, to resolve disputes, and urges all Congolese stakeholders to pursue negotiated solutions to their differences with respect for the constitutional framework and the law. It calls on the Government to respect the space and role conferred on parties by the Constitution with a view to ensuring their effective participation in the national political debate, and encourages all parties to remain committed to the political process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the declaration of the Conference of Presidents of the Congolese National Assembly of 26 March 2007, in which all parliamentary groups reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the democratic process and recommended that all institutions of the Republic work towards reconciliation, national harmony and permanent dialogue between political stakeholders.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the efforts of MONUC to re-establish dialogue between the Government and opposition parties and to contribute to the protection of the civilian population.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"The Security Council takes note of the Communiqué of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union of 24 March 2007 and of the Communiqué of the Extra-Ordinary Summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Heads of State and Government held in Dar-es-Salaam on 28 and 29 March 2007, which reaffirms the sovereign right of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to have a single national army and urges all armed groups to integrate into the national army or to be demobilized.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">"The Security Council reiterates the importance of the international community's continuing support for the peace consolidation process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly with a view to carrying out urgently security sector reform, and the need to ensure concerted action by international partners to this end. It recognizes that such support must be based on a shared commitment from the Congolese authorities and all Congolese political actors to national reconciliation and to the strengthening of democratic institutions."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-9.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/9</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
