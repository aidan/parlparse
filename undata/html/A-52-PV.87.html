	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">As members will recall, the General Assembly began consideration of both items at its 86th plenary meeting on 2 June 1998. In my letters of the same date transmitting to the Permanent Representatives texts of the draft decision under agenda item 21 and the draft resolution under agenda item 60, I stated that, in the absence of any objection by 12 noon yesterday, 3 June 1998, I would have the revised texts issued as "L" documents. I should like to inform members that I have received a reply from only one delegation, which reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">"I would like to inform you that my delegation has carefully studied the revised texts following the debate in the General Assembly yesterday and is in complete agreement that you can now proceed accordingly."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">I hope that all those present will associate themselves with this letter.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">With this concurrence, the Assembly therefore has before it a draft decision submitted under agenda item 21, issued as <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.76.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/L.76</a>, and a draft resolution submitted under agenda item 60, issued as <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.77.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/L.77</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa05">I should like to draw the attention of Member States to a slight correction in the English version of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.77.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.77</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa06">The first "of" in the second line of the first preambular paragraph should be replaced by the words "contained in". The first preambular paragraph should therefore read:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa07">"Having considered the aspects concerning the organization of work of its regular sessions contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/241</a>,".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa08">In draft decision <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.76.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.76</a>, the General Assembly welcomes the views expressed by the Presidents of the Assembly at its forty-ninth, fiftieth and fifty-first sessions, commends the efforts made by the Main Committees in the streamlining of their agenda and method of work, and decides to continue the consideration of the revitalization process of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa09">With regard to draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.77.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.77</a>, members will recall that the General Assembly held informal consultations immediately after the adjournment of the 86th plenary meeting to discuss the text of the draft resolution on the organization of work of the regular sessions of the General Assembly. Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.77.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.77</a> is the result of the consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa10">In the preambular paragraphs of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.77.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.77</a>, the General Assembly recalls <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 51/241</a>, whereby it adopted the recommendations of the Open-ended High-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System, and notes the provisions of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-36-67.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 36/67</a> of 30 November 1981 concerning the opening date of the regular session as well as the observance of the International Day of Peace. In the operative part, the General Assembly sets the date of 8 September 1998 for the closing of its fifty-second session and 9 September for the opening of its fifty-third session. By this draft resolution, the Assembly would continue to observe the International Day of Peace on the opening day of the regular session, and include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session the item entitled "Strengthening of the United Nations system" for further consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa11">In view of the urgency of the matter before us and the desire of the members to dispose of these items expeditiously, I should like to consult the Assembly with a view to proceeding immediately to consider the draft decision under agenda item 21, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.76.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/L.76</a>, and the draft resolution under agenda item 60, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.77.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/L.77</a>. In this connection, since both documents <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.76.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.76</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.77.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/L.77</a> have been circulated only this morning, it would be necessary to waive the relevant provision of rule 78 of the rules of procedure. However, I should like to remind members that the texts of the draft decision and the draft resolution have been made available to delegations as annexes to my letters dated 2 June 1998 to all Permanent Representatives.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa12">The relevant provision of rule 78 reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa13">"As a general rule, no proposal shall be discussed or put to the vote at any meeting of the General Assembly unless copies of it have been circulated to all delegations not later than the day preceding the meeting."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa14">Unless I hear any objection, I will take it that the Assembly agrees with this proposal.</p>
