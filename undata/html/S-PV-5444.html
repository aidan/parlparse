	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the inauguration on 20 May of Iraq's constitutionally elected Government and congratulates the people of Iraq on this milestone in their country's political transition.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Council is particularly encouraged by the fact that the Government is representative of Iraq's many diverse communities and expresses its hope that the Ministers of Defence, Interior and National Security Affairs will be appointed as soon as possible. The Security Council encourages the new Government to work tirelessly to promote national reconciliation through dialogue and inclusion and to build an atmosphere in which sectarianism is rejected. The Security Council, at the same time, urges all Iraqis to participate in the political process peacefully, demanding that those who continue to use violence lay down their arms. The Council wholly condemns acts of terrorism in Iraq, including recent horrific attacks on civilians and religions sites aimed callously at provoking intercommunal tensions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council underlines the high expectations in the new Government to deliver improvements in security and stability, in human rights and the rule of law, in the provision of essential services, and in economic progress and prosperity. The Council urges the Government to work effectively and energetically to this end. The Council also strongly urges all States and relevant international organizations to continue and enhance their help to Iraq's sovereign Government at this crucial time. The Council notes the particular role of Iraq's neighbours and calls on them to conform to relevant Security Council resolutions and to examine how they can reinforce their contribution. In this context, the Council also looks forward to the continued efforts of the League of Arab States, including the forthcoming conference in Baghdad, in support of the political process the Council has endorsed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms its support for a federal, democratic, pluralist and unified Iraq, as a responsible member of the international community, in which there is stability, prosperity and full respect for human rights and the rule of law. The Security Council also reaffirms the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-24.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/24</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
