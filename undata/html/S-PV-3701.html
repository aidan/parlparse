	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1996-834.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/834</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 8 October 1996 from the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council has considered, in the light of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1034(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1034 (1995)</a> of 21 December 1995, the current situation with regard to the investigation of violations of international humanitarian law in the areas of Srebrenica, Zepa, Banja Luka and Sanski Most as well as in the areas of Glamoc, Ozren and elsewhere throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council recalls the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-988.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/988</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council expresses deep concern about the very little progress achieved so far in these investigations and strongly appeals to all the parties of Bosnia and Herzegovina to make every effort to identify the fate of the missing persons, both for humanitarian and legal purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council is concerned that endeavours by the relevant international authorities to identify the fate of the missing by, <i>inter alia</i>, carrying out exhumations has met with limited success largely due to obstruction by Republika Srpska. It notes with concern that the fate of only a few hundred missing persons has been so far established.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council welcomes the recent visit by the delegation from Republika Srpska to the International Tribunal on former Yugoslavia in The Hague and expresses hope that this visit marks a turning point in relations between Republika Srpska and the International Tribunal and will facilitate cooperation with regard to investigations conducted by personnel of the International Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council condemns all attempts to obstruct the investigations or to destroy, alter, conceal or damage any related evidence. The Council stresses again the obligations of all the parties to cooperate fully and unconditionally with the relevant international authorities and among themselves with respect to such investigations and reminds the parties of their commitment under the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Annexes thereto (collectively the Peace Agreement <a href="../pdf/S-1995-999.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/999</a>, annex).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council reaffirms that the violations of international humanitarian law throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina as described in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1034(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1034 (1995)</a> must be fully and properly investigated. The Council reiterates that all States and concerned parties have an obligation, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-827(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 827 (1993)</a> of 25 May 1993, other relevant resolutions and the Peace Agreement, to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal and to comply without exception with requests for assistance or orders issued by a trial chamber. The Council expresses again its support for the endeavours of the international agencies and authorities involved in these investigations and invites them to pursue and intensify their efforts. It encourages Member States to continue to provide the necessary financial and other support.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council will continue to follow this issue closely. It requests the Secretary-General to keep it regularly informed on progress reached in the investigation of the violations of international humanitarian law referred to in the report mentioned above."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1996-41.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1996/41</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
