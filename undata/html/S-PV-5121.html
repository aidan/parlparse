<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to recall that at its 5070th meeting, on 4 November 2004, the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1571(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1571 (2004)</a>, by which it decided that the election to fill the vacancy in the International Court of Justice should take place on 15 February 2005 at a meeting of the Security Council and at a meeting of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">This morning, the Security Council and the General Assembly will proceed independently with the election, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Statute of the Court, for the purpose of filling the vacancy which occurred on 11 February 2005 owing to the resignation of Judge and former President of the Court, Mr. Gilbert Guillaume of France.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">The Security Council has before it the following documents: <a href="../pdf/S-2005-50.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/50</a>, which contains the nomination of a candidate by national groups of States parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice; and <a href="../pdf/S-2005-52.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/52</a>, which contains the curriculum vitae of the candidate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">I should like to inform the Council that, after the expiration of the deadline for submission of nominations, the Secretariat has been informed that the German, Honduran, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Swiss and Uruguayan national groups nominated Mr. Ronny Abraham as a candidate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">The Security Council also has before it a memorandum by the Secretary-General, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2005-51.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/51</a>, describing the present composition of the Court and setting out the procedure to be followed in the conduct of the election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">I should like to remind the Council that, under article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"Those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of votes in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">The required majority in the Security Council is eight votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">Article 15 of the Statute of the Court provides that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"A member of the Court elected to replace a member whose term of office has not expired shall hold office for the remainder of his predecessor's term."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">Accordingly, the member elected to fill the remainder of the term left vacant by the resignation of Judge Gilbert Guillaume will serve until 5 February 2009.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">The voting will be held by secret ballot. When we proceed to the vote, members of the Council will receive a ballot paper containing the name of the candidate. No withdrawal will be accepted once the ballot papers have been distributed. However, it would be possible to withdraw between ballots. Members of the Council will be requested to place an "X" in the box next to the name of the candidate for whom they wish to vote. Votes may be cast only for a candidate whose name appears on the ballot paper.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">I should like to remind members of paragraph 15 of the Secretary-General's memorandum (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-51.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/51</a>), which specifies that "Each elector may vote for only one candidate". Any ballot paper containing votes for more than one name will be considered invalid. When a candidate has obtained the required majority of votes, I shall communicate the result to the President of the General Assembly, and I shall request the Council to remain in session, pending the receipt from the President of the General Assembly of the result of the voting in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">The Council will now proceed to draw lots to select two delegations, excluding Benin, which presides in February, to serve as tellers.</p>
