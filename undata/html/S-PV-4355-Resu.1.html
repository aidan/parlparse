	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Thailand and Nigeria, in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Mexico. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Navarrete</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The delegation of Mexico is very gratified to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia presiding over this meeting of the Security Council. Allow me to convey to you, Sir, my country's great appreciation for your Government's firm support for the consideration of the issue of small arms in international forums.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After the statements that we heard this morning, my delegation does not wish to be repetitive or overwhelm the Council with a lengthy and cumbersome speech on small arms and light weapons, but we would like to respond to the invitation extended by the Government of Colombia to consider this issue in the context of the activities and mandates of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">In a broader context, that of the whole international community, the recently concluded United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects -- which has already been referred to many times -- demonstrated a broad interest in taking a multilateral approach to this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">The problem became of particular concern in the mid-1990s. The estimated figures for 1995 indicated that approximately 500 million small arms were circulating worldwide, as you noted in your statement, Mr. President. Recent estimates speak of about 600 million small arms, which originate from 600 manufacturers in 95 countries. When the Council discussed this issue two years ago, in September 1999, concern was expressed about the proliferation of small arms and light weapons and the destabilizing effects of their excessive accumulation and circulation, especially in regions of conflict. Moreover, the Secretary-General was requested to include in the studies of the problem the humanitarian and socio-economic consequences of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons, of transfers of these weapons and of their illicit production and sale.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">In the two years that have elapsed, notwithstanding the arms embargoes imposed by the Security Council, the excessive availability of small arms and light weapons has not been reduced in countries in conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">We believe it necessary to once again appeal to the exporting countries to exercise a greater level of responsibility in their international transfers of such weapons. This was eloquently underscored by the representative of Mauritius during this morning's debate. We would like to note that we should continue the practice established by the report of the Chairman of the Security Council Committee on the situation in Angola, which raised the question of the use of arms traffickers and the provenance of arms obtained by illicit means, and made recommendations on how to tackle these problems. As the Security Council investigates the activities of intermediaries in the small arms trade, and the trail of financial transactions involved in this field, it will have at its disposal more information on which to formulate recommendations and take decisions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">The question of small arms is multidimensional. Mexico believes that the Member States of this Organization should make a commitment to provide weapons only to those Governments that are acting in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. As was stated this morning by the Ambassador of Bangladesh, the Member States should also undertake to establish a worldwide zone free of child soldiers. The Security Council should have at its disposal specific information on small arms in those cases where there is a threat to international peace and security. To this end, the coordination mechanisms within the United Nations system could be improved, and communications with subregional and regional organizations could be strengthened, as well as with non-governmental organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">The Security Council should study in depth the lessons learned in the area of small arms. The Lessons Learned Unit of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, in conjunction with the Department for Disarmament Affairs, could present a report on the excessive availability of small arms and light weapons in conflict situations and the repercussions of such weapons on peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">Mexico believes that advisory missions to consider the question of small arms in regions of interest to the Security Council should have the consent of the State or States involved. In a broader context, such missions might help to define the specific assistance needs of States suffering from excessive accumulations of this kind of weaponry.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">In conclusion, I reaffirm my country's firm commitment to the full implementation of the measures proposed in the Programme of Action of the previously mentioned United Nations Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">We are confident that the Security Council and the General Assembly will continue to consider the issue of small arms within their respective mandates. The outcome of that consideration will be examined in the review conference in 2006.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Mexico for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Argentina. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Before giving the floor to the representative of Argentina, I wish to express to the Mission of Argentina the sorrow of the presidency concerning the death a few days ago of Ana María Moglia, who was a member of the Argentine delegation in the Council and an outstanding colleague of many of those present here. May our condolences be conveyed to her family in Buenos Aires.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">I now invite the representative of Argentina to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Listre</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for being present today at this important debate on small arms. I commend you, Sir, on your initiative, and on the excellent work that has been done by the Mission of Colombia, headed by Ambassador Valdivieso, in preparing for this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">I would also like to thank you most especially, Mr. President, for your condolences for the loss of an excellent civil servant, an excellent friend and an excellent servant of the United Nations, Counsellor Ana Moglia, and I am sure members of the Council who were here last year when Argentina was a member will remember her qualities. I am particularly grateful for your words of condolence and I will certainly convey them to her family.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Today, the international community is aware of the magnitude of the problem caused by the proliferation and the excessive accumulation of small arms and light weapons around the world. As has been noted in this debate, the United Nations has made it clear that the uncontrolled circulation and easy availability of these weapons currently causes the death of more than 500,000 individuals annually as a consequence of civil war, conflicts and crime. It is estimated that 40 per cent of the global arms market is diverted to the black market, fuelling the majority of regional conflicts that have arisen since 1990.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">The Secretary-General has noted that small arms and light weapons must be the next focus of urgent global attention, since these arms exacerbate conflicts, cause flows of refugees, undermine international humanitarian law and engender a culture of violence and impunity. These arms destroy the social fabric and constitute a menace to peace, development, democracy and human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Reducing the steadily growing access to these arms in the world is one of the most serious challenges the international community faces today.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">To combat this, more laws and regulations are needed, and especially the political commitment to act with resolve when looking for affective answers to solve this problem. To do this, it is necessary to adapt and optimize existing resources in order to prevent, control and reduce this menace responsibly and efficiently.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">Every region and country has its own characteristics, and the solution must be developed taking these particularities into account.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">In contrast to the progress achieved in the field of arms of massive destruction, a framework of global standards and norms for eliminating the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons was lacking.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">Among the initiatives previous to the recent Conference in New York, we can mention the United Nations resolutions on the matter, and especially the commitment shown by heads of State at the Millennium Summit, where it was resolved to take concrete action to end illicit arms-trafficking as part of a broad common vision for a secure and peaceful world.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">Aside from the initiatives mentioned, we should add the pioneering work of the Organization of American States in creating the first binding regional instrument on the issue: the Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials, which supplements the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">The United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects has marked a turning point in the stance of States in combating illicit trafficking in these weapons. The Programme of Action adopted at that Conference establishes a series of measures to put an end to illicit trafficking, to try to make transfers of weapons transparent and to support regional disarmament measures.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">Argentina notes with satisfaction that this included a commitment to establish penal measures criminalizing the manufacture and the illicit trafficking of these arms, as well as administrative regulations and monitoring bodies for their production, circulation, export and import. It is encouraging to see the development of international criteria on the arms brokering, the detection of the routes of illicit trade and the location of its points of supply.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">We underscore in this respect the appeal to countries to cooperate with the United Nations system for the effective implementation of arms embargoes decreed by the Security Council in accordance with the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa14">An international programme of action could not be implemented if the proper instruments were not developed at the national, subregional, regional and international levels. Within the framework of the Southern Common Market and Bolivia and Chile, initiatives have been taken to address this problem: first, the creation of a common registry of vendors and purchasers of firearms, their parts and ammunition; and secondly, the creation of a firearms group, whose mission will be to harmonize legislation, increase cooperation and act as the focal point for coordination in following up the Programme of Action adopted by the Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa15">Argentina, like many countries, is not spared the consequences of the illicit circulation of small arms. The increase in the rate of urban violence, which in my country has taken a tragic number of innocent victims, is often the consequence of the illicit arms trade and the ease with which any individual can acquire a gun on the black market. These facts are a cause of great concern and are among our Government's priorities for action.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa16">We trust that the Security Council will play an important role in adopting an integrated approach to this problem. We believe that there are two important aspects to be taken into account: the first is the inclusion in the mandates of peacekeeping operations effective measures for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants; the second is the creation of mechanisms to monitor effective compliance with sanctions. The mechanism created for Angola and that established on 30 July by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1363(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1363 (2001)</a> for Afghanistan are positive concrete examples.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa17">The goal is to pool our efforts to tackle a multifaceted problem that cannot be attacked on just one front but must be attacked on various fronts simultaneously and concertedly. Coordination and international cooperation are fundamental for achieving this. Only in this way can the problems of war and violence be reduced to manageable levels, and conditions for the security of the population be made favourable. This is an indispensable factor for life, liberty, peace, solidarity, economic progress and harmony in international relations.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdés</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">First, Mr. Foreign Minister, let me welcome your presence in this Chamber, which underlines the importance of the topic that brings us here. Let me also congratulate Colombia on the initiative of convening an open debate on the question of small arms in the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">There is no doubt that this is a problem with universal dimensions, which our Organization should address not only in the Assembly but also in the Security Council. In this regard, the presidential statement of the Security Council on 24 September 1999, which incorporated this item on its agenda, recognized that what we are facing is "multifaceted and involves security, humanitarian and development dimensions". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1999-28.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1999/28</a>, second paragraph</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Because we are really dealing with "small arms of mass destruction", it is vital to take every opportunity to keep alive the commitment to combat this scourge on all fronts.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">The question of small arms is a complex issue that represents a serious threat to human security. We believe that we must undertake to eradicate this scourge through measures that promote respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance, as well as equitable socio-economic development and the implementation of programmes to eradicate the culture of violence and replace it with a culture of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Here we must take note of the outcome of the recent United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. In this context, we fully support the substance of the presidential statement made by Ambassador Camilo Reyes of Colombia, who so successfully guided the proceedings of the Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">We agree that the Conference represented a very significant step, in that it was the starting point of a process to address in a comprehensive manner one of the most urgent issues in the area of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">However, we, too, were disappointed at the fact that it was not possible to reach agreement on recognizing such significant aspects of this struggle as the establishment of restrictions on the private ownership of weapons and the need to eliminate their transfer to non-State actors. We are convinced that agreement on this last aspect would have markedly facilitated the work of the Council. For this reason, we deem it appropriate to note that the Secretary-General highlighted the potential benefits that the international community might expect from an understanding on these issues.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">On this particular point, we believe it important to reiterate that at the Conference, Chile expressed its conviction that it was essential to make progress on the elaboration of an international instrument to strictly limit the manufacture of, and illicit trade in, these weapons. It stated also that, in a matter that is so closely bound up with human suffering, we should promote restrictions that will safeguard life, above and beyond simple free-trade considerations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">We believe that the Security Council must play an active and clear-cut role in this process and that it should in its work consider the fresh responsibilities that the international community has set out in the Programme of Action of the Conference. For this reason, we would to highlight a number of initiatives that take on particular significance in the light of that document.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">It is clear that the question of the proliferation of small arms is a source of immediate concern in post-conflict peace-building situations. It is therefore essential for the Security Council to consider including in peace agreements and in the mandates of peacekeeping missions specific measures to give effect to programmes for disarmament and arms destruction and for the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants, with particular emphasis on the situation of child soldiers.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">We believe also that we must incorporate in the process of planning peacekeeping operations experts who are skilled in the area of international humanitarian law, human rights and the rights of refugees, including provisions relating to children and gender issues, so as to ensure the effective implementation of these principles. As a reflection of the importance of these programmes, it is also essential to allocate the necessary resources for their implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">It is clear that illicit flows of small arms complicate the work of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes. Not only should the States involved strive to restrict these flows, but the Security Council should also make rigorous use of the monitoring mechanisms available to it. In other words, this body should not simply confine itself to calling for the implementation of these measures; it should ensure their full and effective implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa13">We believe that efforts to restrict the flow of small arms will require a change in the way in which sanctions are applied. On this particular point, the Council will have to continue to explore new ways of improving the effectiveness of arms embargoes by reviewing the functioning of existing sanctions committees.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa14">It is extremely important to strengthen preventive measures in order to restrict the use of these weapons and avert the need to resort to the programmes mentioned earlier. In order to do so, the Security Council should have available to it, in its consideration of each conflict, the relevant information about the illicit use of small arms and military weapons. This would make it possible to give priority to such illicit use in the general framework of the efforts deployed by the Security Council in the process of the restoration of stability.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa15">In this regard, the Security Council must play a dynamic role in educating Member States about the negative effects of sustained flows of weapons to hotbeds of tension and to areas of conflict. These efforts can be enhanced through the exchange of information and the development of close international cooperation with the various regional and subregional bodies involved in the monitoring the destabilizing proliferation of these weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa16">We would like to conclude by highlighting the tremendous responsibility we have in alleviating the plight of peoples that are hostage to crime and armed conflict, which are fuelled by the excessive and uncontrolled circulation of these weapons. We must find solutions to promote social and economic development as well as national, regional and international stability. As Ambassador Reyes noted at the conclusion of the Conference on the illicit trade in such weapons, we should continue to address this question in all its aspects until the conscience of mankind is at long last satisfied that all that can be done has in fact been done, in order to alleviate this global tragedy.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Chile for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Brazil. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Moura</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, the delegation of Brazil joins previous speakers in welcoming your initiative and in expressing our satisfaction at seeing the brotherly country of Colombia presiding over the Council. Your presence here reflects the importance of this moment for Colombia. We are certain that during the month of August, the Council will be in very good hands under the leadership of Ambassador Valdivieso. I am also grateful to the Secretary-General for his important statement this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">No other United Nations body, in its daily activities, experiences the effects and consequences of the uncontrolled circulation and use of small arms as does the Council. When this matter was dealt with in the Council for the first time two years ago, Brazil had the honour of occupying one of the non-permanent seats. Our then Foreign Minister had the opportunity to participate in a productive debate on an issue that was new and not very visible at the time. There can be no doubt that the ministerial meeting of the Council and the presidential statement issued at that time helped to give this issue visibility on the world scene.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">Much has changed since then. The situation is more complex and fraught with challenges. Mechanisms for addressing the question of small arms are much more developed. Thanks to extensive discussions, the issue is much better understood, and the many dimensions of its manifestations in various regions of the world have been recognized. The notion of the primary responsibility of States has been consolidated.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Two months ago the General Assembly adopted the Protocol against the Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. In our region, the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms came into force. More important than any of this, we managed to agree on a Programme of Action in the context of the recently concluded United Nations Conference on the Illicit Traffic in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Therefore the Security Council today is debating this issue in a context in which the international community has already laid common bases for addressing these problems.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">It is important to conserve the achievements of the Conference. The success was due to a large extent to the skills of Ambassador Camilo Reyes, and it is essential that we give the worldwide follow-up process that has already been agreed upon the opportunity to yield fruit. We are pleased to note that the Colombian initiative to further pursue this issue recognizes the limits of the jurisdiction of the Security Council in this field and the need to avoid creating a process parallel to that of the Conference. Small arms are being addressed by the Security Council as elements in some of its items and not from any conceptual perspective, which could encompass the whole set of problems in all their aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">For Brazil, the dimension of the phenomenon of small arms and light weapons that is of particular concern to the Security Council is the conflict dimension. The role of the Council with respect to small arms relates to conflict prevention, the implementation of arms embargoes, the collection of surplus arms in the post-conflict phase and the work of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">We know that this important role is not exclusive to the Council, but it should be combined with the efforts of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, in particular, and with regional and subregional initiatives. Similarly, an integrated and balanced approach to the phenomenon that takes into account, for example, the fact that small arms are also something that fuel organized crime, drug trafficking and terrorism would go beyond the mandate of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">In the area in which this body has jurisdiction, it seems essential to us to highlight the importance of securing strict monitoring of the implementation of arms embargoes decided upon by Council resolutions. We would like here to place on record our recognition for the efforts of the sanctions committees to ensure monitoring of measures to combat illicit trade in firearms in regions or entities that are subject to sanctions and to make public the actions of persons and countries that are involved in sanctions violations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">The reduction of the military capacity of UNITA in Angola is proof that the Security Council, in conformity with the mandate of relevant resolutions, may play a key role in worldwide efforts to combat illegal arms flows.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">We are also convinced that two of the major objectives of the Council in the area of small arms -- preventing conflicts and strictly implementing arms embargoes -- have been strengthened in the Conference in the sense that it was able to adopt a political undertaking to provide small arms and light weapons only to governments or entities properly authorized to receive them.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">The basic document that the delegation of Colombia has circulated for this debate contains a series of important proposals. In order to make an input in this thinking process, I would like to highlight some points which, it seems to us, could strengthen the role of the Council, without getting into the sectors that relate to other bodies of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">First of all, the Council should be ready to enter into dialogue with regional and subregional agencies that are also involved in Council agenda issues and which have experience or initiatives in the area of small arms. We encourage the Council to continue the policy of strict implementation of arms embargoes in all sanctions regimes and to continue to provide incentives to all States to cooperate with the investigations of the sanctions committees.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa13">It is also important to take into account measures to ensure that surplus weapons in a conflict that has just ended are not diverted to neighbouring countries or other regions where there is potential conflict. As to the Conference on illicit trade, the Council could send a positive signal by welcoming the adoption of the Programme of Action and reaffirming the commitment to contribute to the implementation of its provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa14">Lastly, at the first biennial meeting for the implementation of the Programme of Action, the Council might call on the Secretariat to provide information on the progress achieved in securing the objectives set in those paragraphs directed to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa15">Solving the problem of small arms requires the commitment of all States, the assistance of civil society and input from international, regional and subregional organizations. The Council alone cannot successfully tackle this challenge. But it is positive that this matter is being discussed and the views of States Members with respect to what they expect from the Council's activities are being listened to. We hope that this open debate will result in a substantive decision that will once again reaffirm the determination of the Council to work together with all concerned and contribute to collective efforts to eradicate the evils caused by small weapons.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Brazil for the kind words that he has addressed to Colombia.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Belgium. I invite to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Ruyt</span> <span class="nation">Belgium</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- the associated countries of Cyprus, Malta and Turkey; and Iceland and Liechtenstein, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries belonging to the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">I would first like to congratulate Colombia for assuming the presidency of the Security Council and to thank China and Ambassador Wang for his excellent service in the month of July. I would also like, in particular, to thank you, Mr. President, for having come from Bogota in order to preside over this open debate of the Security Council and thus give us the opportunity to express ourselves on a subject that is of particular concern to us and on which Colombian diplomacy and particularly Ambassador Reyes have devoted so much energy -- namely, the illicit trade in small arms in all its aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">We can never repeat enough that there are more than 500 million light weapons and small arms currently in circulation around the world, and that in armed conflicts 8 out of 10 victims are civilians, many of them women and children. How can we ignore this scourge that fuels conflicts and seriously destabilises civil society? Public opinion expects us to take action. None of our countries can resolve this problem alone. That is why we need to act together.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">At the start of the Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in July, the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister declared, on behalf of the European Union, that it was essential to be able to achieve concrete results in a number of what we consider to be priority areas: the implementation of export controls and export principles; the development of an international instrument on marking and tracing, as well as on brokering; specific actions concerning stockpile management and the destruction of surpluses; and a particular emphasis on disarmament, demobilisation and the reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">The European Union was not able to obtain at the Conference everything that it considered essential for effectively controlling illicit trafficking in small arms, in particular in areas having to do with export principles applied in the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as well as of the European Code of Conduct for Arms Exports and the European Union Joint Action on Small Arms and light weapons. The final text nevertheless contains important elements relating to marking, tracing, export controls, stockpile management, DDR and assistance for the world's most affected areas, mainly Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">Furthermore, we are very gratified by the decisions to organize in 2006, at the latest, a review conference to examine the implementation of the Programme of Action and to hold biennial meetings to evaluate the progress made at the regional, national and global levels that will ensure a follow-up to the Conference. In this context, I wish to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his remarks this morning, which clearly point the way for us. This follow-up is vital for ensuring that joint action against this illicit trafficking is effective in the long term.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">Lastly, the follow-up opens the way for the preparation of negotiations concerning marking, tracing and brokering. This kind of initiative is of particular importance to the European Union, which has already begun important work along those lines.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">The Programme of Action asserts that the illicit trade in light weapons prolongs conflicts and involves elements that touch on conflict prevention and settlement, as well as on development. The participating States have therefore decided to prevent, control and suppress all aspects of the illicit trade in light weapons, laying particular emphasis on regions of the world where conflicts are ending and where there is an urgent need to resolve serious problems posed by the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">The Programme of Action also provides for the application of DDR programmes comprising measures for the collection and destruction of light weapons, in particular in post-conflict situations, and for the inclusion, whenever appropriate, of specific provisions for such programmes in peace agreements. At the regional level, there are also a number of measures aimed at strengthening moratoriums on the transfer and manufacture of light weapons and at support for DDR programmes, especially in post-conflict situations. Lastly, at the global level, the participating States have undertaken to encourage, particularly in post-conflict situations, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">In this regard, we have undertaken to encourage the Council to study, on a case-by-case basis, the possibility of including, if need be, relevant provisions concerning disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in the mandates and budgets for peacekeeping operations. The incorporation of these measures into a comprehensive strategy is, in our view, an effective and coherent way of supporting peacekeeping efforts and, above all, of guaranteeing their durability.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">The European Union considers it essential that all the efforts made to convene the Conference be followed by concrete effects. The States that have to contend with post-conflict situations must be helped and supported by international decisions and measures taken in compliance with the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa12">As we have already said, none of our countries can resolve the problem of the illicit trade in light weapons and small arms alone. The European Union will therefore welcome with enthusiasm any initiative that will make it possible to enhance the follow-up to the Conference, as well as the implementation of the measures already taken and of those that will enable all the actors concerned to strengthen their capacity to combat this trade in an effective and lasting way.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Belgium for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of the Philippines. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Manalo</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">At the outset, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month. We also congratulate China on its presidency last month. At the same time, I wish to congratulate you and your country on the leadership and initiative you have shown throughout the process leading to and during the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and for having convened this important meeting today.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">Like your country, the Philippines has not escaped the problems that have been caused by the proliferation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons. In this regard, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his statement earlier this morning, in which he once again captured the true depth of this problem.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The international community took a step in the right direction in addressing this problem when, less than two weeks ago, we concluded our small arms Conference with the adoption of a Programme of Action. We must continue to move in the right direction and build on what we have achieved. The proliferation and the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons are and should be of direct concern to the Council. While the other organs, particularly the General Assembly, and agencies of the United Nations all have particular roles to play in addressing this problem, the Security Council has a unique and singular role, not only because the top producers of small arms and light weapons are members of the Council, but also because all have, in various forums, supported efforts to address this problem. Moreover, the Security Council's role is important primarily in two areas: arms embargoes and the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">Illicit small arms transfers have become commonplace. New and old weapons move with unbelievable ease, but when United Nations arms embargoes are defied, that is when we see how truly insidious the activities of illicit arms brokers are. Thus, we find it most significant that the Programme of Action recalls the obligations of States to comply fully with Security Council arms embargoes. The Programme of Action also contains the commitment of States to take appropriate measures at the national level against any activity that violates a Security Council arms embargo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">We strongly urge the Security Council to continue looking into ways and means of enhancing the effectiveness of arms embargoes, including reviewing the functioning of existing sanctions Committees and encouraging States to provide all relevant information on embargo violations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">While we understand the particular constraints involved, the Philippines strongly supports the call made by the Secretary-General and others two years ago, during the ministerial-level consideration of this issue in the Security Council, that measures for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants be included in peace agreements and the mandates of all United Nations peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">We are particularly glad that the Programme of Action on small arms did not limit DDR to post-conflict situations. It is true that, as far as United Nations practice is concerned, the mindset is to apply DDR only to post-conflict situations, but there are far too many conflicts in which the United Nations is not involved and applying this rule to all conflicts is and would have been a grave error. If we are to wait until conflicts end, there may be no one left to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">We believe that even before conflicts cease, even before a conclusive military or political solution is reached, combatants should have a viable and practical opportunity to take themselves out of the conflict and for their small arms to be collected. The fact is that some combatants, given a choice, might prefer to do this, but that, in the absence of DDR, they may turn to crime, piracy, acts of terrorism or other similar activities. The Philippines therefore thanks those who supported our view and helped bring this progressive element into the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">We believe that our overall efforts to address the problem of small arms and the momentum that we have been building would receive a welcome boost if the Security Council were once again to place itself fully and squarely behind these efforts through a presidential statement or a resolution. This would give added political impetus to the follow-up action to the Conference and the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Finally, the Philippines looks forward to working with the various organs and agencies of the United Nations, the relevant international and regional organizations, other States and members of civil society in implementing the Programme of Action, including preparing, as appropriate, for the various follow-up meetings to review its implementation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of South Africa. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kumalo</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I welcome you to New York, Mr. President; it is good to see you here. You know, Sir, we in the Non-Aligned Movement used to be very envious of Colombia for its wonderful city of Cartagena, but now we are truly, truly envious of your having won the Copa América; we congratulate you and the people of Colombia.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">South Africa is pleased that the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects successfully adopted a realistic and implementable Programme of Action. In that regard, I wish to recall the statement made by the head of the South African delegation during the general debate at the Conference, when he said that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg010-bk02-pa03">"the Conference provides the international community with a unique opportunity to collectively express itself on the dangers posed by these weapons and to adopt a realistic and implementable programme of action. Such a collective effort would initiate a long-term process to prevent, combat and eradicate this threat to peace, stability and sustainable development".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">In that regard, South Africa is satisfied that the Conference achieved its goals. While it must be recognized that the Programme of Action adopted by the Conference strikes a delicate balance of differing views, the Programme provides for the first time an internationally agreed framework for preventing, combating and eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects on the national, subregional, regional and global levels in a realistic, sustained and comprehensive manner.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">The successful conclusion of the Conference, Mr. President, was possible thanks to the important role played by your Government, and in particular by Ambassador Camilo Reyes in his capacity as President of the Conference. His leadership and contribution, as well as that of Ambassador Carlos dos Santos of Mozambique, the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, inspired the Conference to seek compromises and to adopt a realistic and achievable Programme of Action. Their dedication to the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects is symbolic of the plight of the peoples of States most affected by the scourge of those weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">South Africa is particularly pleased that the Programme of Action is based on the approach adopted by States most affected by the threat of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Africa collectively responded to that threat through the adoption of the Bamako Declaration on an African Common Position on the Illicit Proliferation, Circulation and Trafficking of Small Arms and Light Weapons, thereby providing a framework for an African solution to a problem that transcends national and regional boundaries. In terms of that framework, the small arms problem is addressed from an inclusive perspective of arms control and disarmament, post-conflict peace-building, conflict prevention and socio-economic development. In addition, the Declaration concerning Firearms, Ammunition and Other Related Materials in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the adoption of a SADC draft protocol in August this year will facilitate subregional cooperation to combat illicit small arms proliferation; this is of particular relevance to the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">South Africa also welcomes the agreement that the General Assembly should convene a follow-up conference by no later than 2006 to review progress made in the implementation of the Programme of Action. That conference and its preparatory phase, including meetings of States on a biennial basis, would consider national, regional and global implementation of the Programme of Action. It would also ensure that the process started by the United Nations Conference is sustainable and that it remains relevant. It would further ensure that the United Nations continues to play a central role in addressing the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. In that regard, South Africa welcomes the various references in the Programme of Action to the role of the United Nations, other international organizations, non-governmental organizations and civil society in assisting States to promote and implement the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">Although the important role of the Security Council in implementing the Programme of Action is recognized and welcomed, the nature and origin of the Programme of Action as an initiative of the General Assembly should be respected when the Council considers initiatives related to small arms. Given the nature of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and the fact that the Programme of Action was developed and adopted through a process initiated by the General Assembly, this issue should continue to be dealt with in the ambit of the General Assembly. The Security Council's involvement in this issue should be confined to specific areas related to the Council's agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">In that regard, South Africa welcomes the commitment made by States in the Programme of Action to encourage, particularly in post-conflict situations, the disarmament and demobilization of ex-combatants and their subsequent reintegration into civilian life, and to provide support for the effective disposition of collected small arms and light weapons. Of related importance is that one of the measures is to encourage the Council to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the inclusion of relevant provisions for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in the mandates and budgets of peacekeeping operations. South Africa furthermore welcomes the undertaking by States to take appropriate measures, including all legal or administrative means, against any activity that violates a Security Council arms embargo in accordance with the United Nations Charter and to cooperate with the United Nations system to ensure the effective implementation of Security Council embargoes.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">South Africa recognizes the important interrelationship between the role of the Council in the implementation of Programme of Action and its responsibilities with regard to international peace and security issues. It is, however, regrettable that the Programme of Action, owing to the concerns of one State, does not include a commitment by all States not to provide arms to so-called non-State actors or rebel groups. The continued supply of arms, in particular small arms and light weapons, to rebel groups and other non-State actors clearly runs counter to efforts by the Council to promote peace and stability in specific areas of conflict. A commitment by all States to provide arms only to Governments would, in our view, have strengthened the Council's efforts to prevent the supply of arms to rebel groups that continue to destabilize peace and security in many countries in Africa. In that regard, we remain concerned that rebel groups and other non-State actors continue to receive arms despite various initiatives by the Security Council. As that issue drives to the core of the problem associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in Africa, South Africa trusts that both the General Assembly and the Security Council will remain seized of this matter.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of South Africa for his statement, and in particular for the congratulations he conveyed to Colombia about the Copa América success. I know that he celebrated Colombia's victory as though he was Colombian. Of course, other ambassadors were not quite as happy with the success of Colombia, but it was still generally celebrated. Once again, many thanks.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative of New Zealand. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. MacKay</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">At the outset, let me congratulate you, Mr. President, on your initiative in the Council's role in relation to the issue of small arms and light weapons, particularly following the important achievement of the Programme of Action at the small arms Conference last month here in New York.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">The Programme of Action underscored the multifaceted nature of the small arms issue and the real and immediate threat that these weapons pose to the security of nations and individuals. While the final outcome was not all that we might have hoped for, it is the first time the international community has agreed on measures to tackle the illicit trade in these weapons. At this stage, may I acknowledge the pivotal role that was played by Colombia, and in particular by Ambassador Reyes, in ensuring that the Conference had a successful outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">The Security Council's powers under Chapter VII of the Charter to take measures considered necessary to deal with threats to or breaches of the peace include, in appropriate circumstances, the imposition of arms embargoes to prevent the proliferation of small arms in a particular environment. We consider that, with careful thought, such measures can be helpful in achieving the core objective of restoring peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">We recognize that it may be argued in some circumstances that imposing embargoes where the size of opposing arsenals is already skewed may do little more than freeze the existing balance of power. But, on the other hand, the Council's overriding concern should be to defuse the conflict situation as much as possible. The importation of more arms only adds fuel to the fire. It also might place additional lives at risk, including lives of personnel of operations mandated by the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">While the Council should continue to use these powers where necessary, it must also be sure that the effect of such measures will both halt the proliferation of small arms and make the prospect of an end to conflict more likely. The cooperation of all States is needed to ensure that domestic systems are in place to comply with such measures.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">In our view, consideration should also be given to strengthening the capacity of the Secretariat so that it is able to provide further support for monitoring by the Council, to ensure that any embargo is not circumvented by illicit trade.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">Recent conflicts in Sierra Leone and Angola have shown, however, that embargoes on weapons alone might often prove insufficient. In situations where conflicts are fuelled by the uncontrolled exploitation and smuggling of natural resources, measures should also be taken by the Security Council to address these factors. Further work must be undertaken on refining United Nations sanctions, including arms embargoes, so as to ensure that they are effectively targeted towards achieving sustainable peace with a greater certainty of success.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">The Council also has an important role to play in ensuring that the widespread and uncontrolled presence of small arms and light weapons in areas of recent conflict does not disrupt nations' peace-building efforts. This requires the more frequent inclusion of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration elements in post-conflict United Nations peace-building operations, as recommended in last year's Brahimi report on United Nations peace operations. I note that a number of those who have spoken before me have also placed considerable emphasis on this aspect.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">Recent experience in Sierra Leone and Kosovo has certainly shown that such measures are by no means easy, but they are absolutely essential. If stability is to be achieved, the law of the gun must not be allowed to reign freely. It is the role of the Security Council to recognize when such elements are required in missions and to include appropriate provisions in mission mandates.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">We have seen this ourselves in our own region, the South Pacific, where small arms have exacerbated recent unrest and conflict. We have also seen it further afield in our peacekeeping and peace-building work with the United Nations. Countries of our region find external support to be vital as they try to resolve conflict. While the supporters come mainly from regional partners, the international community also has an important part to play, as the United Nations continues to do, for example, in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Mr. President, we fully endorse your objective in seeking to formulate a set of practical and workable recommendations as an outcome of this meeting, and we look forward to the final product.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of New Zealand for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative of the Republic of Korea, whom I invite to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sun Joun-yung</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I would like to express my warmest welcome and appreciation to you, Mr. Minister, for chairing this Security Council open debate on the issue of small arms. I would also like to pay tribute, through you, to Ambassador Camilo Reyes, who guided us to the successful conclusion of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">My delegation believes that the Programme of Action adopted by the Conference, spelling out concrete measures to be implemented at national, regional and global levels, provides a solid framework to monitor and review its implementation. At the same time, I would like to stress that the adoption of the Programme of Action is just the beginning of a long process to address this issue. Indeed, what lies ahead is a concerted effort to translate specific provisions contained in the Programme of Action into concrete action.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">My delegation finds today's forum very timely and useful, not only because it will provide added momentum for our global efforts, but also because it will deepen the Security Council's understanding of its role in this field.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">In recent years, there has been growing concern over the impact of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, as they claim innocent lives, exacerbate conflicts and impede post-conflict peace-building and rehabilitation. As the United Nations body bearing primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the Security Council should remain committed to finding a remedy to the problem of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">It has been nearly two years since the question of small arms was explicitly addressed in the Security Council. Recently Member States have highlighted the need to tackle the small-arms problem in the context of other Council open debates, most notably during this past June's debate on the prevention of armed conflict and April's debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts. We believe that the small arms question requires the continued attention and active engagement of the Security Council, and that the Council should be brought more fully into the fold of international efforts to address the issue.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">I would like to take a moment to comment on a few of the points in the Programme of Action that I find particularly relevant to this debate.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">I believe that the Security Council is well equipped to foster the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants in conflict and post-conflict situations. Recalling that the proliferation of small arms and light weapons contributes not only to the outbreak of conflicts, but also to their recurrence, we cannot stress enough that disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes are a core element of conflict prevention and post-conflict peace-building efforts. At the United Nations Conference last month an overwhelming majority of States called for more substantive assistance from the international community for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes. This call was based on the recognition that, if the deep-rooted reasons for the demand for small arms were not addressed, it would be impossible to do away with the culture of violence.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">As was made evident by recent events in Sierra Leone and Liberia, a lack of resources and political will for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration efforts often leads to renewed violence in conflict-prone areas. It should be noted that the Programme of Action encourages the Security Council to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the inclusion of relevant provisions for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in the mandates and budgets of peacekeeping operations. This issue has particular relevance for the Security Council, as its peacekeeping missions have increasingly engaged in post-conflict reconstruction and even nation-building activities, where the collection and destruction of small arms and the rehabilitation of ex-combatants are critical not only for the success of the mission, but also for the sustainable peace and development of States concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">In addition, we recognize that the Security Council's arms embargoes can be powerful tools for curbing the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. We welcome the fact that the Programme of Action calls upon each and every State to take appropriate measures, including legal or administrative ones, against any activity that violates a Security Council embargo. However, we find it deeply disturbing that small arms and light weapons continue to be smuggled into areas where Security Council arms embargoes have been imposed. We recommend that the Security Council further study ways and means to improve the effectiveness of its arms embargoes.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa10">We would also like to stress the particular importance of preventing the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in areas of actual and potential conflict. Certainly, a comprehensive approach to tackling the problems associated with these weapons will help minimize the incidence and intensity of violent conflicts and alleviate the suffering of innocent civilians. With this end in mind, the Security Council should strengthen its role in combating both the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and preventing their excessive and destabilizing accumulation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa11">Finally, we would like to encourage the Security Council to become involved in the follow-up to the Programme of Action. To this end we believe, as noted in the document prepared by Colombia for this open debate, that a follow-up report of the Secretary-General identifying, inter alia, areas in which the Security Council can play a more active role, would be of great value.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa12">The Security Council has a valuable role to play in preventing, combating and eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. As a strong advocate of curbing this illicit trade, my Government stands ready to support the Security Council's initiatives to facilitate the implementation of the Programme of Action.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Alcalay</span> <span class="nation">Venezuela</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">I would like to begin by hailing the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia, Mr. Guillermo Fernández de Soto, who is presiding over this important meeting. At the same time, I wish every success to our colleague Alfonso Valdivieso, as, during this month of August, in which Colombia holds the presidency of the Council, he continues the marvellous job begun this morning by his Foreign Minister. We are certain, Sir, that the work of the Permanent Representative of Colombia as President of the Security Council this month will be a reflection of his estimable record as a diplomat at the United Nations and of Colombian diplomacy in general.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">I would also like to salute the presence of the Secretary-General in our discussion this morning. This underscores the importance that the Secretariat attributes to the debate that is taking place in the Council today.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">Although it is true that small arms and light weapons are not the causes of conflicts, ready access to them, combined with their widespread circulation and uncontrolled proliferation, has contributed to disturbances that affect communities around the world. The tremendous ease with which it is now possible to acquire these weapons on the international market, their indiscriminate spread in civilian populations and their use in violent activities and in crime -- in addition to their use in terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking, as has been noted here on various occasions -- make the problem even more disquieting. In order to illustrate the seriousness of this situation, suffice it to mention that in the last decade 46 of the 49 conflicts that took place in various parts of the world were carried out chiefly by means of the use of small arms and light weapons. Millions of men and women around the world today mourn the loss of members of their families, and countries have lost outstanding professional people to help their development because of the harmful effects of these small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">But at this stage, the debate, which is the second of its kind in this Council, is of particular importance because it was preceded by an important and successful meeting, the Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, under the brilliant leadership of Ambassador Camilo Reyes, to whom all previous speakers have paid tribute for his remarkable contribution to the negotiations on the Programme of Action. Thus, the Security Council faces a task that has already been developed in the General Assembly, and it must take further steps and become a compass for action, working to incorporate all the contributions that have already been made in order to make an effective and efficient contribution to what has already been done in the General Assembly, as a number of speakers have stressed.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">The delegation of Venezuela takes the view that consideration of this issue by the Security Council is a significant challenge in this debate that the Organization has been holding on an issue of tangible current importance on the multilateral disarmament agenda, concerning which we need to pool our efforts to adopt a comprehensive approach that takes into account aspects such as arms control and disarmament, post-conflict peace-building, conflict prevention and social and economic development. This endeavour requires coordinated action involving a range of different bodies that are concerned with this issue so as to ensure this comprehensive approach.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">The Security Council's role should certainly be oriented towards considering the implications of this problem within the purview of this principal organ, which is international peace and security. From this standpoint, it is our view that the Council has a specific interest in this issue, given its responsibility in peace-building, which in turn involves support for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, pursuant to the agreements voluntarily entered into by the parties. At the same time, the measures adopted by the Council in dealing with conflicts in various regions of the world have a genuine impact on efforts to reduce the spread and excessive accumulation of small arms through the implementation of arms embargoes, whose provisions, by the way, are binding on all States, and Venezuela complies with them in full.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">The United Nations has given significant impetus to the development of a global awareness, which has enabled the first steps to be taken towards the creation and implementation of measures that, as they are phased in, could be an effective advance in controlling the illicit trafficking, excessive accumulation and uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons. In this endeavour, we should highlight the work of the various panels of governmental experts, which have been created to identify better within this Organization the means of tackling the problem in its true dimension. The recent Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons made it possible for us to secure a global political commitment by means of the adoption of the Programme of Action, whose aim is to prevent, combat and eliminate small arms and light weapons in search of a peaceful balance inside our countries, and which highlights the chief responsibility borne by States, the chief architects in carrying out these measures.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">Venezuela considers that efforts to find solutions to the problem of the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons should follow a comprehensive, balanced and non-discriminatory approach that takes into account the specific characteristics and experiences of the regions, subregions and countries involved, with a view to tackling this criminal activity in all its aspects. At the same time, my country considers that with the support and participation of civil society, the primary responsibility for tackling these problems should fall to Governments. From this standpoint, there must be safeguards for the right of a State to acquire weapons to meet its legitimate needs of defence, in conformity with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, in order to prevent manipulation and biased interpretations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">In various regions of the world, States have taken specific measures to counteract the illicit proliferation of small arms. This is true in our hemisphere, where the Organization of American States broke new ground by adopting in November 1997 the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials, and with the preparation of model regulations on firearms, parts and components by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">The commitment of Venezuela to international endeavours to combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is attested to by the adoption by the National Assembly, the legislative organ of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, of the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials, as published in the official bulletin of the Republic, issue number 37.217 of 12 June of this year.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa11">Venezuela is convinced that the international community must base its efforts on cooperation in order to tackle the problem of small arms and their effects on peace and stability, in view of the links between them and other illicit activities that might also jeopardize the security of States.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa12">Allow me to conclude by noting the result of the Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons. This outcome is the beginning of a process that will make it possible to achieve measures of greater depth and scale as we proceed further, in order to tackle the problem effectively and comprehensively. In this regard, we believe that the elimination of the excessive proliferation and accumulation of small arms, together with other measures proposed here, will undoubtedly contribute to the solution of the conflicts to which we have referred.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Erwa</span> <span class="nation">Sudan</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">At the outset, on behalf of the Group of Arab States, which the Sudan has the honour of chairing this month, allow me to welcome you, Mr. Minister, as you preside over the Security Council during this month of August. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate your friendly country on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council this month. We are confident that this will represent yet another achievement in the list of Colombia's diplomatic successes.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">Allow us also to thank you, Sir, for your initiative to convene this important meeting and for having invited non-members of the Council to participate in this debate. I should like also to take this opportunity to thank the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China for the outstanding and wise manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the Security Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">Today's meeting is being held in the wake of the recently concluded United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Your country, Mr. President, had the honour of presiding over the Conference, in the person of Ambassador Camilo Reyes. Ambassador Reyes played a central role in the process and deployed major concrete efforts, throughout difficult negotiations, to reach a consensus on the text of the Programme of Action to prohibit the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">The Programme of Action, through various measures - national, regional and international - and review mechanisms, has given the international community a firm foundation for undertaking serious efforts to combat the threat posed by the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">The implementation of the Programme of Action will require intensive efforts by Member States, the United Nations and relevant and international regional organizations in order to undertake constructive initiatives in implementation of the Programme's objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">The Group of Arab States contributed to the success of the Conference through many positive proposals that promoted the possibility of, and enhanced efforts to reach, a consensus. The Arab Group, in this context, wishes again to express its regret at the fact that the Programme of Action does not contain a clear commitment by Member States to export weapons only to Governments. That call was made by all African States, in the light of the fact that Africa is the continent most affected by the threat of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the hands of rebel groups, thereby threatening peace and security in the continent. The importance of this commitment can be clearly seen in the many conflicts that the Security Council deals with on an almost daily basis, in which these criminal groups work to undermine security in the African continent.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">Many of the statements made during the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects stressed that this illicit trade was not a defining element of the nature of the many emerging conflicts in many parts of the world. However, such traffic does fuel existing wars. Conflicts have their roots in the remnants of colonialism; in economic, social and human conditions; in ethnic strife; in the proliferation of poverty, debt, illiteracy and infectious diseases in developing countries, in particular the least developed countries; in the glaring inequities in international, trade, and economic relations between developed and developing countries; and in situations of occupation, which lead to political strife followed by military action.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">The Arab Group believes, therefore, that all efforts must be focused on dealing with these root causes in order to put an end to the human suffering caused by the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">The Arab Group believes that issues relating to disarmament fall within the mandate of the First Committee of the General Assembly. That Committee has adopted many resolutions on these questions. Our Group believes that the role of the Security Council must be a supporting one in respect of the efforts undertaken by the General Assembly. We also hope that the Security Council will fulfil its role in coordinating with relevant bodies to mobilize resources and expertise in order to implement the Programme of Action on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, as well as provide assistance to States in implementing the Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">Nevertheless, our Group understands the Council's interest in the threat posed by small arms and light weapons, in the light of its role and responsibility, as enshrined in the Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security, and considering also the interlinkage between the proliferation of these small arms and light weapons in the conflict zones that the Council deals with.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa11">All of these challenges are underlined in the Programme of Action, which also encourages the Security Council to consider the inclusion, on a case-by-case basis, of appropriate measures relating to disarmament, demobilization, resettlement and reintegration in the mandates of peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa12">The Arab Group hopes that any measures taken by the Security Council in future on the subject of small arms and light weapons will be in line with the provisions of the Programme of Action. We hope that the Security Council will give due consideration to the fundamental right of States to self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter, which implicitly gives States the right to acquire weapons to defend themselves and to establish their own defence systems.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa13">The Security Council is also called upon to respect the right to self-determination of peoples under colonialism or other forms of foreign domination or occupation. We express the hope that the Council will strictly abide by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including the sovereign equality of all States, their territorial integrity, the need to resolve disputes by peaceful means and non-intervention in the affairs of other States.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa14">The Programme of Action stresses that efforts pertaining to small arms and light weapons must not encroach on priorities related to nuclear disarmament and to those pertaining to weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa15">In this regard, the Arab Group hopes that the Security Council will give due consideration to nuclear disarmament and to weapons of mass destruction, which are a genuine threat to humankind and are closely linked to international and regional peace and security. These priorities are set forth in the final declaration of the 1978 General Assembly special session devoted to disarmament, which stressed that utmost priority be given to nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and then to conventional weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa16">The threat of such weapons is clearly seen in the grave situation in the Middle East, where Israel possesses weapons of mass destruction. The world witnesses daily the excessive use of military force by the Israeli occupation forces against an unarmed Palestinian people struggling for its right to self-determination.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa17">In conclusion, the Group of Arab States pledges to continue its efforts and contributions to combat the threat of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, in the United Nations and in all other relevant international and regional organizations, and to support the review conference in 2006 and other meetings devoted to reviewing the progress made nationally, regionally and internationally in implementing the Programme of Action.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Egypt. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bebars</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">At the outset, let me say that it is a great honour, on behalf of the Arab Republic of Egypt, to extend to your country and to you personally, Sir, our sincere congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month. I would like also to take this opportunity to convey to the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China our profound thanks for the efforts made during China's presidency of the Security Council last month. We would like also to emphasize the importance that we attach to the inclusion of the issue of small arms and light weapons on the agenda of the Security Council following the recent United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We wish also to extend our thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the statement he made at the beginning of this meeting. We would like also to point out the objectives that we hope to achieve in today's meeting, which are contained in your letter, Mr. President, addressed to the previous President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">Egypt would like to associate itself with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of the Sudan on behalf of the Arab Group. Egypt considers illicit trafficking in small arms to be one of the most important problems affecting specific regions of the world. Because of the illicit and speedy proliferation of small weapons and its links with many ethnic, cultural, political and economic problems, this matter requires a solution that takes into account the specific conditions and circumstances in the affected areas. The proliferation of small arms and light weapons should be seen not as a cause of conflict, but rather as a tool for fomenting and fuelling ongoing conflicts, which find their root causes in a number of economic, social and ethnic factors that have accumulated and become complex.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">To effectively put an end to this problem, we have to work through two parallel approaches. The first approach gives us a conception of the social and economic factors involved in this problem as the real root causes of the conflicts that lead to the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the long and medium terms. The second approach emphasizes confronting the problem of illicit trade and circulation of small arms and light weapons in the short term.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">At the national level, Egypt has witnessed a period of stability in respect of small arms and light weapons. This stability is due to our strict legislation and regulations in this area, which go back to the 1950s. Our legislation controls all forms of trade, manufacture and possession of such weapons, criminalizes illegal activities and establishes national mechanisms to make laws and to implement them. At the regional level, Egypt is working in cooperation with its African neighbours through the exchange of experts and technical information in order to find definitive solutions to limit the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons on the African continent, which is the continent suffering most from armed conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">The Bamako Declaration issued by the African ministerial meeting on small arms and light weapons, which was held in Mali in November 2000, is a pioneering regional initiative that reflects a joint African decision to work together against the illicit proliferation, circulation and trade of small arms and light weapons. During that meeting, in a spirit of cooperation, Egypt and its African brothers searched for a solution that takes into account the specific nature of this problem for some countries of the African continent.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">At the international level, Egypt has actively and positively participated in the work of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, which produced an ambitious political Programme of Action aimed at combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and criminalizing other related illicit activities. It also aimed at safeguarding the control of national authorities over legal activities in order to prevent the use of such weapons in any illegal activities, at enhancing regional and international mechanisms to deal with the root causes of the problem of illicit trafficking and at limiting its adverse impacts in terms of poverty, the slow pace of social and economic development and ethnic conflicts in the affected countries.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">In this connection, we would like to stress, absolutely and clearly, that dealing with this issue is linked to the non-infringement of a number of rights. Prominent among them is the right of peoples to self-determination and self-defence, particularly those peoples under the yoke of foreign occupation.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">Moreover, the State has the right to carry out all legal activities in this area, to control its own territorial integrity, to monitor the small arms and light weapons it manufactures and to stipulate legislation to combat illicit trafficking in those weapons and to prevent their use and circulation in such illicit activities as terrorism and crime.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">Addressing this issue in no way undermines the priorities of the international community in the field of disarmament, which are clearly defined in the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament in 1978, in which nuclear disarmament enjoyed the highest priority, followed by other weapons of mass destruction and, finally, by conventional weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">Because of the exacerbation of the problem of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and the close relationship between the smuggling of these weapons and international peace and security, the Programme of Action adopted by the Conference clearly identifies the international community's sphere of activity, especially that of the Security Council. The Programme, in paragraph 38 of section II, encourages the Security Council</p>
	<blockquote id="pg018-bk02-pa11">"to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the inclusion, where applicable, of relevant provisions for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in the mandates and budgets of peacekeeping operations".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">The Programme of Action also emphasizes in other areas the importance of the cooperation, commitment and total compliance of States with Security Council resolutions imposing arms embargoes in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, it calls on all States to take all appropriate measures, including all legal and administrative means, against any activity violating a Security Council arms embargo.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">Finally, it is important to emphasize that the Programme of Action is considered to be the sole instrument for contending with problems related to the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. It identifies in a comprehensive manner the priorities, commitments and national, regional and international standards in this area. If we adhere to the goals and measures set out in the Programme, we will reap the fruits of all the international community's efforts to combat the dangerous proliferation and trade in small arms and light weapons.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of India. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pal</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">We thank Colombia for calling this open meeting on small arms and we are honoured that you, Sir, are presiding over it. As Ambassador Valdivieso's paper makes clear, the focus of this meeting is wider than that of the Conference last month on the illicit trade in small arms, but the larger problems the Council will consider grow from the same roots.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">As the Council said in its presidential statement in September 1999,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg019-bk02-pa03">"the prevention of illicit trafficking is of immediate concern in the global search for ways and means to curb the wrongful use of small arms, including their use by terrorists". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1999-28.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1999/28</a></i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">Perhaps 1 per cent of the global stock of small arms is illicitly held, but that comes to 5 million weapons. Conflict diamonds constitute a similar tiny fraction of the global trade in roughs, but the international community is trying to put in place a stringent, verifiable system of controls to make illicit trade much more difficult. The Council has given that process its support; indeed, the international effort to identify and ban conflict diamonds started here, and proscribing the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons must have at least as high a priority.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">Like any other commodity, the trade in small arms is licit only if both exports and imports go through official, legal channels. Arms exports by a Government that violate none of its laws are nevertheless illicit if the weapons are sent to non-state actors in another country, bypassing or subverting laws there. Since terrorists and non-state actors exploit this loophole, buying arms on the international market when they are not covertly or illegally supplied by States that promote terrorism, the international community must agree -- as it was unable to do at the Conference last month -- that the trade in arms must, as the rest of international trade does, flow only through channels authorized by both exporting and importing Governments.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">Members of this Council, given its role in the maintenance of international peace and security, obviously have a special responsibility, and none more so than the permanent members, both because they are the largest arms exporters in the world and because, if they break the law, they can use the veto to protect themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">Over the last decade, the Council has established embargoes to cut off the supply of arms to such violent non-state actors as UNITA, the Revolutionary United Front and the Taliban. When the Council found that these were easily bypassed, investigations it authorized showed how international criminal networks were being used to sell diamonds and supply arms in Angola and Sierra Leone. In Afghanistan, the principal exports of the Taliban are drugs and terrorism, and the arms embargo is as riddled with holes as the latticework for which one of its neighbours is famous. We hope that the monitoring mechanism that the Council set up for Afghanistan a few days ago will do its work well. If the arms embargo is still flouted, we expect the Council, as it has in West Africa, to tackle the problem at its roots and to take measures against those responsible.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">Elsewhere, as the United Nations tries to help build peace after a conflict, disarmament is often the first and knottiest challenge its peacekeepers face. Your working paper, Mr. President, asks what happens to the small arms collected in a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration campaign. They must be destroyed, but that is often the problem easiest to resolve. Many of those who fight in these internecine conflicts have grown up with arms; in the world they know, a gun is the only means, they think, of staying alive. It protects them and they use it to force others to give them food and shelter. Unless the United Nations offers them security and they have other means of livelihood, most do not give up their arms or give up only a few of them. This means that the United Nations must send its peacekeepers so well-armed and equipped that they can truly offer security to all sections of the local population and face down those who refuse to give up their arms. It also means that the international community must be generous with its support for the economic programmes of rehabilitation. Without this, combatants could be driven, by the fear of destitution if nothing else, to keep their arms.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa09">Over the past 50 years, small arms have become enormously more lethal, the average assault rifle now laying down the volume of fire of early machine guns. They have also become lighter, which means that children can use them much more easily. Much less training is needed with weapons that simply spray bullets over a wide range, and the cost of small arms has plummeted from the 1980s, as some armies have laid off stocks.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa10">All this explains why small arms in the hands of ever-younger combatants have been able to sustain conflicts hugely expensive in terms of lives lost, and why terrorists have been able to take such a heavy toll of innocent lives.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa11">Now, however, small arms are about to make another jump in technology. Some armies are receiving for field trials small arms that integrate integrated-circuit and other cutting-edge technologies into an assault rifle, making them infinitely more destructive. If the past is a guide, these weapons will turn up in the hands of non-State actors well before most third-world armies get them. These are the weapons that soldiers from developing countries will have to face in the hands of terrorists or insurgents at home or, when they go out as Blue Helmets, abroad.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa12">It is more than ever necessary, therefore, to have the strictest controls put in place on the manufacture and export of small arms. International instruments need to be negotiated quickly, and a system or mechanism needs to be put in place to trace and mark small arms and to ensure that they are not diverted from legal channels into the illicit trade. The Council should give its encouragement to that process.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa13">Both the Conference on the illicit trade in small arms and the paper prepared by Colombia (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2001-732.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/732</a>, annex</i>) recognize the usefulness of regional cooperation. However, as with narcotic drugs, with which illicit small arms and terrorism have a nexus, countries or regions into which these are smuggled can only do so much to stop the influx. In the case of narcotic drugs, the onus is placed on producing regions to control the problem at the source. The cooperation of the countries and regions that are the principal manufacturers and exporters of arms is just as essential to the control of this other illicit trade. Some of them have taken steps regionally to stop the illicit trade in weapons; we welcome that.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa14">We trust that the Security Council will take effective practical steps carrying forward, or in support of, the Programme of Action adopted at the Conference last month that will curb the availability and use of small arms to foment and sustain conflict and terrorism.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">The Programme of Action adopted by the United Nations Conference provides a solid framework for enhanced international cooperation in combating the illicit small arms trade. We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President of the Conference, Colombia's Ambassador Camilo Reyes, on his outstanding leadership and on his pivotal role in forging the consensus that was achieved. Australia's expectation is that the Programme of Action will serve as a practical and dynamic point of reference for further work at the national, regional and international levels, including in relation to the Security Council's role in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">We see continuing validity in the presidential statement (<i><a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1999-28.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1999/28</a></i>) issued following the Security Council's open debate on small arms in September 1999, in particular in relation to: the importance of regional cooperation in tackling the issue of illicit trafficking in small arms; the call for greater attention to be given to effective implementation of arms embargoes; the call for measures to discourage arms flows to countries or regions engaged in or emerging from armed conflict; the provision to peace negotiators of best-practice guidance on the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants; the need for effective national regulations and controls on small arms transfers; and the importance of ecologically safe destruction methods, in respect of which we welcome the Secretary-General's report of November 2000 (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2000-1092.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/1092</a></i>).</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">Beyond the enduring importance of the 1999 presidential statement, several aspects of the recently adopted Programme of Action on small arms have particular relevance for the Security Council, namely: the need to place particular emphasis on regions of the world where conflicts come to an end and where serious problems with the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons have to be dealt with urgently, and the importance of mobilizing the political will throughout the international community to prevent and combat illicit transfer and manufacturing of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">In addition, some of the more specific measures recommended in the Programme of Action complement the 1999 presidential statement. These include the call for cooperation with the United Nations system to ensure effective implementation of arms embargoes decided by the Security Council, and the call for consideration by the Security Council, on a case-by-case basis, of the inclusion, where applicable, of provisions for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in the mandates and budgets of peacekeeping operations. In that context we would emphasize also the importance of the safe and timely disposal of surplus arms and of the secure management of existing small arms stockpiles.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">Since the start of international efforts to address small arms problems, Australia has been a strong advocate of developing practical, implementable measures tailored to meet the specific needs and capacities of each situation and region in which the problems occur. For example, Australia has strongly supported the development of model legislation on weapons control for Pacific island countries and is examining ways of improving procedures for effective weapons safekeeping and accountancy in that region. Ongoing efforts at the regional level provide a guide to practical activities that can help to reduce the threat to civilians and their livelihoods that can be posed by the availability and circulation of small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">We see an important role for the Security Council in ensuring that small arms issues are addressed as an integral element of the Council's approach to conflict prevention and resolution. Depending on the particular circumstances of each situation, the Council is well placed to develop practical recommendations for addressing small arms issues, drawing on lessons learned to date and on the Programme of Action where applicable.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">We welcome the fact that small arms issues have been increasingly referred to in many of the Council's thematic debates over the past two years. We welcome also the Security Council's endorsement of the Secretary-General's reporting on various missions, including those which cover small arms issues, for example in relation to weapons disposal in Bougainville. This provides further ballast for international efforts to combat small arms problems.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">We urge the Security Council to continue its active efforts to address small arms issues, with particular reference to the spirit and objectives of the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">For its part, Australia will continue to work assiduously for effective implementation of the Programme of Action, in particular in our own region, as part of our global cooperative efforts to combat the illicit trade in small arms and to alleviate the threat it poses to international peace, security and development.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ahmad</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, I would like to begin by congratulating you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of August. Your presence here underscores the important role that Colombia has been playing in leading the international effort to meet the challenge of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Your initiative in arranging today's debate is timely, as this meeting takes place against the backdrop of the recently concluded United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. I must mention here that we had an opportunity to work very closely with your delegation before and during the Conference, and I can assure you that we will work very closely with your delegation even as we pursue its follow-up.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">The Conference adopted a Programme of Action which clearly identifies the responsibilities of States at the national, regional and global levels. The contents of the Programme of Action are now being analysed and examined by Member States for the requisite follow-up measures on their part.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">We welcome this opportunity which you have provided us, Mr. President, by convening today's meeting to examine how the Security Council can play its role in addressing the problem of small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">First of all, I must compliment you, Mr. President, for encapsulating nearly 40 statements in today's meeting. We appreciate your patience. In contrast, nearly 150 statements were made during the three or four days of general debate in the Conference. All these statements should give us enough food for thought and soul searching, certainly not ammunition to create smoke screens to cover the realities.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">Undoubtedly, the easy availability of small arms and light weapons has exacerbated the situation in many trouble spots around the world. The abundance of small arms in conflict situations has also made United Nations peacekeeping efforts more difficult and hazardous. Indeed, disarmament of warring factions is increasingly becoming a linchpin of peacekeeping operations. Pakistan, as a major participant in United Nations peacekeeping efforts, is playing its part in implementing such programmes in conflict areas, particularly, if I may mention, in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">While disarmament programmes and restrictions on the flow of illicit arms help to address the problem, they are not the real and definitive solution. Conflicts attract arms, whether legal or illegal. For every demand, there is a commensurate supply -- and this is applicable to every commodity, including arms. Arms will continue to find their way to wherever conflicts exist. The flow of arms, illicit or otherwise, cannot be completely stemmed. What can be controlled, however, or resolved or even prevented, is not the flow of arms, but the conflicts themselves. That is where the role of the Security Council lies, and where the primary responsibility of the Council lies. Let there be no detraction from the Charter obligations which this body has towards the pacific settlement of disputes and the prevention of armed conflicts. As the old adage goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">Mr. President, you have raised some valid points in your letter of 25 July which was circulated as a document of the Security Council. We agree that the accumulation and circulation of and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security. Addressing this issue, however, is the responsibility of Member States in accordance with the provisions of the Programme of Action adopted by the recent Conference. The Security Council, for its part, must play its role as a facilitator of that process by focusing on its own Charter obligations. The Council's concern should not be so much with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons as with conflict prevention and dispute resolution. The Council must not allow a situation to arise in the first place that entails the use of arms, small or big, or their proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">In fact, somebody once asked Einstein, if I may recall, what weapons would be used in a third world war. He said that he did not know what would be used in a third world war, but he knew that only rocks and stones would be used in the fourth world war. So, whatever it may be, even rocks can become a means to kill each other. Therefore, the best thing is to prevent the situations that necessitate men killing each other. That is the imperative.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">It is not the ready availability of small arms alone which contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence. A culture of peace cannot be created simply by eradicating small arms and light weapons. The problem is not so much the weapons; it is the conflicts themselves. As long as armed conflicts continue to afflict our planet, the means of violence will always be available. Trying to deal with the means of violence is merely to put on a bandage rather than going into the malaise and treating the disease.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">In many cases, violence is generated by denial of justice, and conflicts intensify because of the denial of the inalienable right of self-determination and the continuation of foreign occupation. It is this and not the easy access to small arms which is an impediment to negotiations and the realization of lasting peace. Nobody can deny legitimacy to freedom struggles wherever they are waged and with whatever means they are waged. People do and will fight back when their homeland is occupied and when their intrinsic rights are trampled. The examples of Kashmir and Palestine are clear for all to see. The Council's obligations in such cases are clear: to implement its own resolutions and to take the necessary steps to resolve disputes and restore peace, particularly by implementing its own resolutions and decisions. There can be no deviation from this basic requirement.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">We fully share your view, Mr. President, that the initiatives taken to address the problem of small arms lie outside the competence of the Security Council. You have clearly defined the parameters of today's meeting by acknowledging that this public debate is not meant to establish new definitions or understandings on the question of small arms, nor is it to introduce new norms and codes of conduct. This is a subject on which efforts at the global, regional, subregional and national levels are already in progress.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa12">In our view, the first objective stipulated in your document, which is follow-up action by the Council on the question of small arms, can begin to be addressed through decisive actions by the Council on conflict prevention. The Council can also address the second objective by its fulfilling its obligation to resolve disputes in all conflicts, without exception or selectivity. Chapter VI of the Charter provides the framework.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa13">The Security Council is obliged not only to keep peace, but also to make peace, to build peace. The third objective, regarding the active participation of States, has already been addressed at length in the recent Conference. Member States are fully cognizant of their responsibilities, and any further debate on this issue will not add anything of value. In this regard, the elements identified in your document as issues for consideration therefore also become somewhat redundant. What remains here, however, is the need to underscore the Security Council's Charter obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa14">We believe that the best contribution the Council could make would be to fulfil its Charter obligations on preventing armed conflicts and resolving disputes. The only answer to all the questions raised in your document is for this world body to eliminate the root causes of conflicts, resolve disputes, make and build peace. In addition, necessary concerted action has to be taken to promote sustainable development and economic well-being in all parts of the world. Peace and development are inextricably linked.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa15">The Security Council's mandate is clearly defined. While there may be an urge in the Council to expand its role in all directions, it must not lose sight of its basic functions and obligations. Trying to take on tasks beyond the Council's mandate may be an ambitious exercise; it is also self-defeating. There is a wise ancient saying that he who tries to do everything ends up doing nothing.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa16">That is why the Council must not lose sight of, nor indeed its focus on, its Charter obligations and must try to fulfil them completely and without selectivity. If the Council wants to make a genuine contribution to the question of small arms, then it must focus on the areas that are directly within its competence and jurisdiction. These are, I repeat at the risk of repetition, the peaceful resolution of disputes and the prevention of armed conflicts. We need a resolute but non-discriminatory approach rather than mere rhetoric through public debates.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa17">Pakistan is fully cognizant of its obligations under the Programme of Action adopted by the recent Small Arms Conference. All Member States are conscious of their responsibilities. The question is whether the Security Council is willing and able to play its role in accordance with its obligations, as enshrined in the Charter. This is where the effectiveness and the credibility of the Council, and that of the United Nations, will be tested. The only way for the Council to tackle the issue of the supply of small arms is to end the demand for them by preventing conflicts and resolving disputes. The Council will, therefore, do justice to itself and indeed to the international community by focusing on its Charter obligations and fulfilling them completely and without selectivity or discrimination.</p>

	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">Canada is pleased with the results of the Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. The Conference concluded with the adoption of a Programme of Action that showed the international community's determination to tackle the problem of small arms trafficking. This success is based on solid foundations, in particular on the specific, future-oriented action of the African States, the member States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the countries of Latin American and the Caribbean.</p>

<div class="italicline-spokein" id="pg024-bk03">

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Heinbecker</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa01">We now have a consensus document that acknowledges that the small arms trade as a whole, and not just the illicit aspects of that trade, poses real and urgent problems. We have all agreed that Governments are responsible for acting on such issues as manufacturing, marking and tracing, record-keeping, export controls, brokering, stockpile management and the collection and destruction of small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa02">The Programme of Action that we have agreed to also recognizes the human dimension of the problems linked to small arms, including their impacts on women and children -- aspects of the issue in which my country has invested particular time and effort. Another positive aspect for Canada is the Programme's attention to the issues of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, issues that others before me have highlighted today.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa03">The results of the Conference are thus very welcome, but they are only a first step. In achieving a consensus result some important elements had to be left aside for the moment. The Programme of Action is a good start, but it is neither perfect nor complete. It includes no elements, for example, on such key factors as regulation of civilian possession of arms, or transfers to non-State actors. Action on these elements, too, was supported by many delegations, but unacceptable to only one.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa04">The Programme of Action also includes little in the way of detail on such key issues as criteria to help Governments clarify the conditions for export authorization or standards for determining what constitutes an excessive and destabilizing accumulation or surplus. These are important elements for Canada, but problematic for some other countries. All these unfulfilled elements are key to any comprehensive international approach to the small arms issue and must still be re-addressed. The issues that could not be agreed on in the Conference can and must be actively pursued and re-addressed in the biannual meetings and the review process.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa05">More broadly, the Programme will be stillborn even in its current form if it is not rigorously and rapidly implemented. Some of these issues can be handled through the follow-up procedures of the Programme itself. The issues on which there was agreement, both those explicitly mentioned in the follow-up section of the Programme and those mentioned elsewhere in the document, should be pursued vigorously in the meantime, starting now.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa06">For our part, in Canada, we have already begun planning and consultations with other States on regional implementation seminars. We will be pushing for implementation not just at the national level but also through all pertinent regional and international organizations of which we are members -- and that is most of them. This includes the Security Council, which can play a key role, for example, by incorporating appropriate disarmament, demobilization and reintegration provisions in the mandate of peacekeeping operations and in securing the necessary financing for those provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa07">The Conference was undoubtedly a success, but still only a qualified success. It would be a mistake to underestimate what we did achieve. Equally, it would be wrong not to recognize how far we still have to go. We owe it to the men and women and girls and boys in places much less comfortable than New York City. Their well-being and security depends on our controlling -- indeed, on our curtailing -- the appalling trade in small arms. We do not believe there is any country among us blind or indifferent to the terrible consequences for these people if we fail. But it has become apparent in negotiations that there are still some philosophical differences of approach on the issue of small arms. In Canada's view, and in the view of many of the countries most severely affected by the instability and insecurity these weapons bring, the access, the management, the sale, the transfer and the use of these weapons must be closely tracked and closely controlled, whether they are in the legal or illegal cycle of transfer. We should know into whose hands these weapons are being sold or given and by whose hands they are being used at all times -- in peace, in conflict, but particularly in turbulent times. No philosophy or ideology gives any of us a dispensation from seeing the terrible harm that these weapons do, and no philosophy or ideology gives anyone an exemption from the responsibility to address them. Just because the issues of transfer and possession are not reflected in our document does not mean they are not reflected in the daily lives of so many people -- lives that are themselves too often curtailed because of these weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa08">The real assessment of the Conference's success will be made on the ground, not in New York, in terms of guns destroyed and lives saved. This in turn will mean some very hard work, nonetheless, for us here in New York, in converting the paper promises of the Programme of Action into reality. It will mean devoting time, money and political will to this issue, and it will mean continuing the battle over the coming years to complete the Programme of Action to make it more comprehensive in its scope and more ambitious in its commitments. The Council may rest assured that Canada will continue with these battles, working closely with like-minded States from all regions of the world until this scourge is alleviated. In that regard, we support the Secretary-General's call for a legally binding treaty.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sharma</span> <span class="nation">Nepal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">Let me begin by congratulating our close friend, Colombia, on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of August. We are honoured by your presence here, Mr. Minister, at today's open debate on small arms, which signifies the importance we should attach to the issue before us. I appreciate the background paper prepared by the Colombian mission, which is focused and useful.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">The debate on small arms could not have been more timely. Only last month, we agreed on a global Programme of Action to combat illicit trade in small arms in a concerted manner. This debate sustains the impetus generated by the Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">Much has been said in recent years about the horrors of small arms as the principal instruments of violence. It is time we joined hands to bring about the dawn of a new era where the glory of life prevails over the glory of guns.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">The menace of guns has shown its ugly face in schools, on streets and in civil wars in different parts of the world. Out of more than 500 million small arms in circulation, a sizeable number are in the hands of non-State actors. If our own recent experience is any guide, once violence has broken out, the distinction between legal and illegal civilian possession of small arms loses much of its meaning. They simply remain the horrendous tools of death.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">The impact of small arms has been deep and wide: rapes, broken families, traumatized lives, violated human rights, overstretched health services, undermined education, misused scarce resources, impeded development, destabilized States, undermined peace, maimed youths and colossal loss of lives. The majority of victims have been innocent and defenceless women and children. Most unconscionable is the growing number of child soldiers, whom people of unscrupulous ambition or greed harness to kill and be killed.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Small arms are indeed as much a security challenge as they are a development problem. Parochial political interests, criminal motives and social discontent fuel the proliferation of small weapons, making them likely to be indiscriminately used.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">Humanity ought to strive for durable peace and security for everyone in the world. To achieve this, we must pursue the peaceful resolution of conflicts as well as disarmament and security at a lower level of armament, stimulate development that is also environmentally sustainable, and promote justice that gives each of us equal opportunity to excel.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">There has been considerable progress in controlling, and in some cases outlawing, weapons of mass destruction, and we need to further strengthen and accelerate the process. The international community, however, has just broken the ground of disarmament in small arms and light weapons, and we have yet to devise a coherent and effective global strategy to prevent the flow of small arms into conflict-prone zones, to reduce our reliance on them for our safety, and to evolve a culture of peace. The United Nations, as in the case of weapons of mass destruction, can play a significant role in this endeavour, too.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">Clearly, the global accord on small arms is just a modest, but good, beginning. We still have to confront the challenge of implementing the agreement, and, more importantly, of moving beyond it to address the remaining issues, in order to make the world safer for all from the scourge of small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">The United Nations has a threefold obligation to confront the problem of small arms. First, it must work with other stakeholders to implement the recently agreed Programme of Action on the illicit trade in small arms. Secondly, in conflict situations, it must join forces with Governments to impose and enforce arms embargoes, to check illegal local production and to prevent legitimately owned weapons from getting into the wrong hands. Thirdly, it must encourage the international community to remove the threat of small arms from the face of the earth by taking additional measures.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa11">Nepal appreciates the fact that the United Nations has already devised an effective approach to demobilizing, disarming and reintegrating combatants in post-conflict situations. This approach must be further refined and incorporated, where appropriate, in Security Council mandates to make peace sustainable. The United Nations must help evolve a workable global strategy to prevent the proliferation of small arms through, inter alia, marking and tracking measures.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa12">Information, as we all recognize, is of critical importance to shaping a prudent policy and executing it effectively. No source of information could match the keen observations of United Nations development and humanitarian workers, who can keep an eye on smouldering social discontent and its facets, or of Blue Helmets manning United Nations observer and peacekeeping missions. Of late, civil society has emerged as a strong partner of this world body and a rich and additional source of information for United Nations agencies and processes.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa13">High-level panels could be helpful if they focused on reinforcing and furthering international consensus, rather than sidetracking or eroding it. Occasional United Nations fact-finding and advisory missions could also be explored as additional sources of information, based on need rather than as a matter of course. These could also prove counterproductive if overused, because of their inherent visibility, in cases where a quieter track 2 approach is critical to striking a deal to resolve an involved inter-State or intra-State conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa14">There is tremendous potential yet to be tapped in regional and subregional organizations, whose physical and cultural proximity can help tremendously to accurately identify and analyse the problem, to forge workable solutions, and to devise effective follow-up measures. The United Nations must take them on board in a more meaningful fashion to optimize the benefits they offer.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa15">The Secretary-General's report must be the linchpin of institutional information, both generic and specific, for the Security Council to act. The Council should therefore request him to furnish as comprehensive a report as possible, including information on the existence of small arms, sources of supply and their possible impact on United Nations peacekeeping missions, so that the Council could formulate its mandates in an informed and appropriate manner. But we must not lose sight of the fact that he often has to work under severe resource and time constraints and that parties in conflict seldom share sensitive information, thereby limiting his capacity to produce the kind of report the Security Council would like to see on its desk. If objectively considered, the lessons learned from past experience could provide additional and invaluable insight to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa16">Having said this, I must confess that Nepal is not in favour of reinventing the wheel. We must try to make the best use of the available resources and mechanisms in a more coordinated and effective manner in order to achieve our goals.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa17">To be sure, an immediate symptomatic treatment of the malady associated with small arms is essential. But a lasting peace will remain a pipe dream until we tackle the root causes of social discontent: poverty, lack of opportunity and injustice.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa18">Often, poor, frustrated and unemployed youth seeking jobs and a station in life succumb to the glory of guns and fall prey to the self-serving designs of thugs, criminals and myopic political leaders. We must empower the young with education, skills and jobs so that they can say no to guns.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa19">This calls for reversing the vicious circle of poverty and conflict, making democracy work for people, defeating crime, accelerating sustainable development, creating employment opportunities, and opening schools and hospitals in poor countries.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa20">We must give our youth hope and opportunity. The international community must come forward to make this happen by assisting the poor countries to develop and by making technology and markets work for the poor.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa21">In essence, it will take social transformation to wipe out the menace of small arms. The Security Council, cooperating with other competent stakeholders, must contribute to this transformation to the best of its capacity.</p>

Costa Rica appreciates the leadership that your delegation has shown under the skilful guidance of Ambassador Valdivieso in this body, while at the same time recognizing your great endeavours in promoting the interests and positions of Latin American countries.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">The presence of small arms is a catalyst in armed conflict. It is quite evident from every standpoint that such conflicts would be impossible without weapons. For this reason, it is not only right for the Security Council to consider this matter; it is indispensable for this body to take strong measures to prevent the threat posed by this kind of weaponry.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">The spread of small arms stokes the fires of violence, heightens hatred and struggle, exacerbates crime and terrorism and favours political and social instability. The presence of light weapons facilitates and encourages violations of fundamental human rights. Arsenals of small weapons prolong armed conflicts and impede the peace processes. Their availability fuels common crime and feeds organized crime. Their indiscriminate sale enriches a few while ignoring the interests and needs of the majority. Military budgets voraciously consume meagre national resources, while our peoples suffer from the most abject poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">In the hands of national armies, small arms are a threat to international peace and security. In the hands of extremist groups or despotic regimes, light weapons become a threat to internal peace and security. In the hands of private individuals, such weapons lead to social breakdown and erode the security of our citizens. The Security Council cannot continue to ignore the suffering caused by the 500 million existing small arms. This body cannot turn a deaf ear to the cries of millions of innocent victims.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">Just two weeks ago, we saw in this city the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons. Quite candidly, I must say, that as far as my delegation was concerned, the result of the Conference was discouraging.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa06">We are dismayed that the Programme of Action adopted there does not explicitly prohibit the transfer of arms to rebel groups. We are indignant that the document does not condemn the dispatch of arms to governments that commit mass or systematic violations of human rights. We are alarmed that no strong measures have been adopted to regulate the possession of light weapons among civilians. We deplore the fact that there has been no agreement on the immediate preparation of a legally binding code of conduct on the transfer of arms. We are concerned that the Programme of Action does not include any explicit reference to human rights, which should constantly guide our struggle to combat this kind of weaponry. Moreover, we regret that these very grave shortcomings have been the result of inflexibility on the part of just a few delegations that around this table profess to defend peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa07">The Security Council, fully and faithfully discharging its primary responsibility for international peace and security, must today take the lead in combating the spread of small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa08">First of all, with respect to all the disputes under its jurisdiction, the Council should adopt or strengthen embargoes designed to prevent, combat and eliminate the inflow of weapons. Such measures need to go hand in hand with effective verification machinery and with the full cooperation both of neighbouring countries and arms producers.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa09">Secondly, the Council must condemn and prohibit the transfer of military material and personnel or financial and logistic support to those countries whose military units or security forces take part in human rights violations. We believe that that ban should also be extended to those States that do not respect democratic principles or that have not ratified the main human rights instruments and instruments of international humanitarian law. The same ban should apply to the transfer of arms to non-State actors, rebel groups and extremist movements.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa10">Thirdly, the Security Council, with the assistance of the Secretary-General, should investigate and find illicit supply routes for small arms and light weapons to various areas in conflict and impose appropriate sanctions on the nations, entities or individuals involved in such activities. We believe that setting up panels of experts similar to those investigating the diamond trade would be a use model to follow.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa11">At the same time, when circumstances in the field so warrant, it would be appropriate to include in the mandate of peacekeeping operations the task of monitoring implementation of arms embargoes and investigating breaches thereof. As part of their mandate, missions should, moreover, be capable of collecting, confiscating and destroying surplus small arms and of promoting the reconversion of the arms industry.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa12">In the medium and long term, the quest for international peace and security requires a substantial reduction in the number of small arms available. Combating the use, misuse and spread of these weapons demands demilitarization in our societies and the creation of a genuine culture of peace and life grounded in greater economic and social equity, the rule of law, democracy, representative government and human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa13">In this context, the Security Council should support disarmament efforts while at the same promoting reduction in military expenditure. Would it perhaps not be better for the $191 billion that the developing countries currently squander on their armed forces to be devoted to health? Would it not be preferable to devote to education the $22 billion spent on arms transfers to the Third World? Would this perhaps not be the best way of guaranteeing peace for future generations?</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa14">For more than 50 years now, Costa Rica has had no arms expenditure. We are a disarmed country without an army, which devotes its public budget to education, preventive health and infrastructure investment. In our land, you will find schools, not barracks. Our children have never seen a helicopter gunship, an armoured car or a warship.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa15">Our experience has taught us that peace is not simply the absence of armed conflict. Genuine peace is the fruit of harmony among the various sectors of society, respectful relationships among peoples and individuals and the rejection of violence and hatred. Peace demands active brotherhood among all people. For this reason, peace can only exist when we recognize that as human beings we are members of the same family. The elimination of small arms is just a first step in that direction.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Costa Rica for his kind words addressed to my country.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Belarus, whom I invite to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ling</span> <span class="nation">Belarus</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">The Republic of Belarus, too, welcomes Colombia's initiative to convene an open debate on small arms and light weapons in the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">The recently concluded United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects was undoubtedly a landmark event in the life of the entire of international community. I should like to express our gratitude to the representative of Colombia, Ambassador Camilo Reyes, whose experience and diplomatic skills enabled the successful convening of the Conference and the adoption of the Programme of Action, which, it must be said, was no easy task. We must also refer to the highly professional and effective work of the President of the Preparatory Committee, Ambassador Carlos dos Santos.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">In the view of the Republic of Belarus, the holding of an international Conference under United Nations auspices and the adoption there of a final document, the Programme of Action, represented a great achievement. For the first time, discussing the problems surrounding the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons was no longer a matter of mere national or regional interest, but assumed a global dimension that drew the attention of the wider world community to this very serious issue. The next stage must be concrete steps on the part of Member States, international and regional organizations, the United Nations and the Security Council to implement the Programme of Action in order to solve the current difficult problems in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">The Republic of Belarus shares the concern expressed by the majority of the members of the world community, who regard the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons as one of the main factors in the spread of international terrorism, the emergence and perpetuation of local armed conflicts and the expansion of violence.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">Belarus also fully shares the fears that the illicit spread and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons pose a real threat to regional and international peace and security. The adoption at the Conference of an agreed Programme of Action and the subsequent discussion of that topic today here in the Security Council are very convincing manifestations of the international community's awareness of the fact that the problem of small arms and light weapons cannot be solved by individual countries, but require agreed and coordinated efforts at the national, regional and international levels.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">My country is committed to the principles of eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and their ammunition and is actively contributing to the fight against that scourge. Relevant information on national legislation and practical steps adopted by the Government of Belarus to combat the illicit trade in these weapons were contained in the statement made by the head of the official delegation of the Republic during the high-level segment of the Conference and have been distributed to members.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">We are convinced that the Security Council can play an important role in solving the problem of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons by giving closer scrutiny to the following aspects of the problem: first, reacting in a timely fashion to facts attesting to the illicit spread and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons; secondly, monitoring the strict compliance of Member States with international obligations regarding Security Council sanctions; thirdly, providing assistance to States in matters of the disarmament and demobilization of ex-combatants and their subsequent rehabilitation and reintegration into civilian society, including the dispatch of advisory missions to States at their request; fourthly, reporting on and summarizing, with a view to establishing best practices, the experiences by States in undertaking national and regional programmes and initiatives to monitor the transfer of small arms and light weapons and ammunition, including measures to combat the illicit trade in such weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, I should like to point out that, in the opinion of the Republic of Belarus, the Programme of Action -- adopted as a result of a compromise -- is a balanced document containing realistic proposals that, if implemented by the international community in the context of the United Nations, will help to resolve the acute problems related to the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Sierra Leone. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kamara</span> <span class="nation">Sierra Leone</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa01">Permit me to express Sierra Leone's delight at seeing you, Sir, chair such an important meeting of the Council at the inception of Colombia's presidency for the month of August. My delegation wishes to express its gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor, Ambassador Wang Yingfan, for a job well done during the month of July. May I also take this opportunity to proffer congratulatory sentiments through you to Ambassador Camilo Reyes Rodriguez for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the affairs of the recently concluded United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa02">Sierra Leone attaches great importance to the outcome and future effective implementation of the provisions of the Programme of Action emanating from that timely Conference, which emphatically highlighted the concerns of my Government, which is only now coming to grips with the scope and magnitude of the former rebel insurgency. It is apparently all too evident that the proliferation and illegitimate utilization of small arms, which caused major devastation and carnage in Sierra Leone for over a decade, indeed lends credence to their being termed the real weapons of mass destruction. It has been noted that, within the West African subregion, there are an estimated 7 million deadly weapons in circulation, and the incessant raging conflicts continue to provide the perfect milieu in which the illicit trade in small arms continues to thrive.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa03">The general debate and technical meetings of the Conference have now subsided, but the issue of follow-up has only just begun. In the words of Ambassador Reyes,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg030-bk02-pa04">"while it is critical that Member States take concerted action against the illicit trade in small arms as soon as possible, they must understand that the Conference and its outcome were only first steps in a process".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa05">It has also been noted that, in the quest to prevent, combat and eradicate this illicit trade, Governments have committed themselves to considering all aspects of the small arms problem, particularly to brokering, tracing and providing financial and technical assistance. While we acknowledge the fact that considerable effort has been made at various levels in all parts of the world to deal with all aspects of the problem, we must now strengthen and build on those foundations.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa06">It is therefore in this vein that we call upon the Security Council to harmonize the positions of Member States in accordance with the provisions adopted in the Programme of Action. The Council must critically emphasize the need for Member States to pursue radical programmes within their respective territories, subregions, regional groupings and elsewhere, aimed at building a greater consensus on the prevention, combat and virtual eradication of the illicit trade in small arms. The Council could maximize its objectives in this sphere by utilizing its many and varied peacekeeping forces in sensitive conflict areas to effectively address the issue of collection, storage, control and destruction of light weapons, also liaising with other actors within the United Nations system, such as the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Development Programme and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to name but a few, as well as through non-governmental organizations and civil society, to implement programmes designed to put the message across.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa07">We regard the Security Council as the forerunner in the global pursuit of the maintenance of international peace and security. The recommendations proposed in the various reports of the Secretary-General should be given much more attention and introspective consideration by the Security Council if the Council is to succeed in that pursuit, especially with regard to the issue of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. It is simply not good enough to issue presidential statements and resolutions that have very little meaningful effect on their intended recipients. My delegation would like to see much more potent action emanating from those statements and resolutions, which would have an appropriately direct bearing and reverberating effect on those recipients. It is the view of my delegation that the Security Council should develop the capacity to have greater leverage over those parties directly responsible for the propagation of conflicts caused by the proliferation of small arms. In short, we wish to see a Security Council that dishes out sterner, more robust and more resolute measures in order to attain its desired Charter objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa08">My delegation also wishes to note that by dispatching advisory missions to conflict areas, the Security Council has invariably grasped in greater detail the full frontal effect, as it were, of the problems involved in many situations. The Council's interaction with high-level delegations ensures complementary cooperation. Regional actors have become more attuned to the inner workings of the Council, to the extent that they look to the Council for guidance and approval with regard to their respective intended measures and aspirations, which do not necessarily run counter to the thinking of the wider international community. With that in mind, my delegation is of the view that the Council should markedly and continuously flex its muscular authority over the form and content of the provisions of the Programme of Action, and more specifically over the question of compliance with arms embargoes.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa09">Sierra Leone calls on other delegations, especially those that are embroiled in conflict situations, to be constant advocates of stricter compliance with the norms of international law as a measure aimed at putting an end to the culture of impunity. Otherwise, the highly lucrative illicit trade in small arms will continue unabated. It is also the view of my delegation that the Council should adopt far-reaching measures to ensure that Member States and their respective authorized entities involved in the production and marketing of small arms are forced to comply with relevant legally binding instruments. It should also effectively cause the strengthening of established moratoriums and similar initiatives and programmes specifically aimed at combating and preventing this trade, which would lead to the eventual eradication of these weapons of mass destruction.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg031-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Ghana. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg031-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Effah-Apenteng</span> <span class="nation">Ghana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, Ghana too joins other speakers in commending you for your initiative to hold this Council debate so soon after the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Given the prominent role played by your country in the discussions leading to the Conference and during the Conference itself, the decision to make this a priority issue for consideration by the Council so early in Colombia's presidency is an eloquent reflection of your country's keen desire to bring about the eradication of this menace, and of its commitment to that goal. We are confident that this debate will enhance consideration of the outcome of the Conference later this year by the General Assembly, which mandated it.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa02">Allow me also to congratulate the Secretary-General and the Department for Disarmament Affairs on their supportive role in ensuring the successful conclusion of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and the adoption of a realistic Programme of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate that phenomenon. Despite its deficiencies, the Programme of Action sets out in a comprehensive manner not only measures to be implemented at the national, regional and global levels to manage and control the illicit proliferation of small arms, but also options for dealing with problems associated with the trend. Since the Security Council is charged primarily with the maintenance of international peace and security, it should play a role that focuses on the following aspects of the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa03">The first of these is lessons learned. There is no doubt that the early integration of former combatants into mainstream civilian life is a critical element that promotes reconciliation and prevents the recurrence of conflict. My delegation feels that the Security Council can contribute to that process through the inclusion, where applicable, of relevant provisions for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) in the mandates and budgets of peacekeeping operations. Such mandates must be broad enough and sufficiently well resourced to enable missions to execute the critical DDR components of their operations. The new logic should be one that calls for emphasis on preventing a former combatant from taking up his or her gun because of a failed demobilization and reintegration effort. The Council must be seen to be working to make that thinking a reality.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa04">Secondly, ensuring the effective implementation of arms embargoes imposed by the Council is one sure way of curbing the supply of small arms and light weapons to conflict areas, particularly to non-State actors. We know that such embargoes have in the past been broken with impunity by arms brokers often acting with the connivance of State actors. We would like to see the Council demonstrate greater cohesion, vigilance and decisiveness in monitoring, exposing and censuring breaches of its embargoes once such conduct is exposed.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa05">The third aspect is the strengthening of regional and subregional mechanisms. The Council's recognition of the complementary role of regional and subregional mechanisms in the maintenance of global peace and security has been evident in its many reports reviewing the progress of various peacekeeping missions. Yet the lack of resources and appropriate technology to make it possible to consolidate initiatives at those levels to encourage activities such as intelligence sharing, transparency, cross-border weapons collection programmes and the coordination of national armaments regulations has hindered the further development and consolidation of existing mechanisms, such as arms moratoriums.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa06">The Council's support and initiative in the establishment of funds, such as the Small Arms Fund, which could support regional initiatives, as envisaged in the Programme of Action, would go a long way towards helping strengthen those mechanisms at the regional and subregional levels.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa07">The fourth aspect relates to follow-up mechanisms. The Programme of Action highlights the promotion of conflict prevention mechanisms as one measure for curbing the need or demand for small arms and light weapons. The Council's involvement, through the use of its good offices to encourage affected States to solicit assistance from other States and from regional and international organizations in the pursuit of negotiated solutions to conflicts, would be pivotal in helping to avert conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa08">The delegations of Member States, particularly those from Africa, demonstrated the necessary political will and flexibility that ensured a successful outcome of the Conference two weeks ago.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa09">Following the Conference, the Council can facilitate the process for the development of an international instrument on small arms by also exhibiting the necessary cooperative support in promoting initiatives such as workshops in various regions and subregions on the small arms issue that would serve as a platform on which to launch the process. The Council, acting in this way, can justify its efforts to participate and contribute in this area.</p>

	<p id="pg032-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Bulgaria. I invite him to take a seat at the table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg032-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sotirov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia, on Colombia's assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of August. On behalf of the Bulgarian delegation, I wish you every success in fulfilling your demanding and challenging tasks in presiding over this important body.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa02">Let me join previous speakers in congratulating Ambassador Alfonso Valdivieso and his colleagues on the excellent preparations for this open debate. We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the consideration of the issue of small arms ---- an item on the Security Council's agenda since September 1999 that is of particular concern to the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa03">The importance of this meeting is emphasized by the fact that it is being convened only a few days after the successful completion of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, chaired in a professional and devoted way by Ambassador Camilo Reyes of Colombia.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa04">Bulgaria has associated itself with the statement made by the representative of Belgium, on behalf of the European Union, and we fully share the view that the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects should be assessed as a landmark in, and an impetus to, the efforts of the United Nations to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in strategic arms and light weapons. We are pleased to see that the positive outcome of the Conference is already galvanizing the political will to fight the problem at national, regional and global levels.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa05">Bulgaria is pursuing a responsible policy of stringent control over arms exports in compliance with existing regional and international standards. I would like to share some of our national experience.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa06">Bulgaria has aligned itself with the criteria and principles contained in the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and the European Union Joint Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons of December 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa07">On 2 February 2001, the Bulgarian Government adopted a special normative act for the implementation of the principles, standards and criteria contained in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe document on small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa08">Our country abides by the provisions of the moratorium on small arms transfers established by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). We welcome the recent decision in Lusaka by the ECOWAS heads of State and Government to renew the moratorium on the import, export and manufacture of light weapons for a second three-year period, with effect from 5 July 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa09">In the context of the foregoing, Bulgaria has introduced and developed a robust system of export controls for foreign trade activities in arms and dual-use goods and technologies, corresponding to the highest existing international standards.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa10">The Bulgarian Government has established the regular practice of adopting special normative acts or decrees stemming from a given international commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa11">During the last two years, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria adopted a series of internal regulations related to the implementation of Security Council sanctions. These acts translate the provisions of Security Council resolutions into Bulgaria's domestic legislation and enforce them with respect to Bulgarian nationals and legal entities. Currently, a governmental decree for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1343(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1343 (2001)</a>, on the imposition of sanctions against Liberia, is in the process of preparation for adoption by the Bulgarian Government.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa12">In accordance with our international commitments and the restructuring programme of the Bulgarian armed forces, the Ministry of Defence has already started projects for the destruction of surplus small arms and light weapons. We are in close cooperation with a number of partners, such as the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands and others, on a whole range of issues regarding stockpile management and destruction of small arms and light weapons. Under the terms of an agreement for cooperation between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defence of the Republic of Bulgaria and the State Department of the United States of America, signed on the last day of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, a surplus in small arms, nearly 80,000 units, will be destroyed using existing facilities in Bulgaria.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa13">In addition to taking steps at the national level, Bulgaria actively promotes regional cooperation in South-Eastern Europe. I would like to refer to the importance of the documents adopted at the Regional Conference on Export Controls, held in Sofia in December 1999. The measures agreed at that Conference enhance national export control systems, in line with the European standards, strengthen the process of regional cooperation in preventing illicit arms-trafficking and controlling exports of arms and dual-use goods and technologies, and constitute a sound contribution to regional stability in South-Eastern Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa14">We commend the valuable practical work of the Security Council's arms embargo monitoring mechanisms. We are convinced that full and strict implementation of Security Council sanctions can be achieved only through goodwill and a synergy of actions on the part of all relevant actors. Improved international cooperation and the coordination of national State policies are indispensable for the attainment of this goal.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa15">Bulgaria will continue its cooperation with the Security Council and its subsidiary bodies on monitoring the sanctions, including arms embargoes, and will render all necessary assistance for the implementation of Security Council measures undertaken under Chapter VII of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa16">Before concluding, let me assure the Council that Bulgaria is fully committed to further contributing to the efforts of the international community to eradicate the illicit trade in small arms, which has a destabilizing effect and poses a threat to international peace and security.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mbanefo</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa01">My delegation is delighted to see Colombia serving as the President of the Security Council for the month of August. I am also happy to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia chairing the meeting today.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa02">It is gratifying to see the Council holding this open debate on the question of small arms shortly after the successful conclusion of the United Nations the Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held in New York last month. We wish to commend Ambassador Reyes of Colombia on his well-deserved election as President of this United Nations Conference devoted to finding solutions to the pressing problems of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa03">This meeting could not have taken place at a more opportune moment. The fact that it is on the agenda of the Security Council, we believe, is an affirmation of the desire of the international community to deal with the problem of the growing illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa04">While it is acknowledged that these weapons, in and of themselves, do not start or lead to conflicts, their ready availability has, nonetheless, frequently caused the escalation of these conflicts and aided the perpetration of criminal activities in many countries. Clearly their proliferation and the illicit trade in them -- which is estimated to amount to 40 to 50 per cent of the global trade in small arms -- pose real threats to the economic and social development of many developing countries, especially in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa05">Without doubt Africa is the most affected region if one considers the devastation that conflicts involving small arms have wreaked on communities and States. We would recall the gory details of the Rwanda pogrom and the untold hardships visited upon the innocent civilians in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia, just to mention a few. The Secretary-General has highlighted the nexus between illicit trade in arms, the illegal smuggling of natural resources such as diamonds, timber and so forth, and the perpetration of conflicts in Angola, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa06">The impact of the devastation caused by small arms and light weapons in Africa cannot be underestimated. In many instances, economies have been totally destroyed and reduced to shambles, infrastructures laid waste and millions of people killed and wounded while thousands have been internally displaced and many more turned into refugees. In the face of this development, responsible members of the international community cannot stand by and allow it to continue.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa07">Even though African States lack the capacity to manufacture small arms and light weapons, the continent unfortunately is the recipient of large quantities of these weapons. It is estimated that in Africa alone there are some 7 million illicit arms and light weapons in circulation. The incessant conflicts and wars in the continent have provided an environment in which trade in light arms is carried out in exchange for the natural resources of the continent. The lucrative barter of arms for natural resources such as "blood diamonds" has provided an opportunity for arms dealers to thrive in the continent. It has also helped rebel leaders to sustain conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa08">In recognition of the enormous suffering that Africa has experienced as a result of conflicts induced by small arms, leaders of the West African countries have tried, for example, to tackle the problems of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons at the subregional level. In October 1998 the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) adopted a moratorium on the importation and exportation of light weapons in ECOWAS States. African Ministers also adopted in Bamako on 30 November 2000 a declaration on a common African position on small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa09">At the national level, my country, Nigeria, has put in place practical measures to tackle the problem through the establishment of the National Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons. Also Nigeria declared Thursday, 5 July 2001 "small arms destruction day" in conformity with the decision reached at the preparatory committee to declare the first day of the United Nations Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons as such.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa10">Nigeria and Africa have taken these initiatives to underscore their awareness of the danger posed by small arms and light weapons. It is our hope that members of the international community and indeed members of the Security Council will take decisions to complement these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa11">In view of the global nature of the problem and the urgent need to deal with it, my delegation would like to say to the members of the Council that the time has now come for us to take far-reaching decisions to complement the decisions already reached at the recent Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. To this end, Nigeria would like to urge members of the international community to render technical and financial assistance where needed to regional and national efforts to eradicate illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Nigeria also wishes to support the call for the creation of a small arms fund to assist States. Furthermore, we urge Member States to share information on a voluntary basis on their national marking systems for small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa12">As a follow-up to the Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons we wish to call for a review conference to take place not later than 2006 to review the progress made in the implementation of the Programme of Action. My delegation also supports the recommendation in the outcome document that further study be undertaken, within existing resources, for examining the feasibility of developing an international instrument to enable States identify and trace in a timely and reliable manner illicit small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa13">In conclusion, we would like to commend the Secretary-General for his report contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2000-1092.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/1092</a>, in which he provided a reference manual for safe methods of weapons destruction for use in missions areas. We hope that members of the various United Nations peacekeeping missions will find this useful during the implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa14">Surely a world free of arms would be a peaceful world, but since this for now is a utopian vision, we can only strive to limit the proliferation of illicit small arms and to ensure that they do not find their way into the wrong hands. Our concerted efforts to address the issues of conflict prevention, peace-building and the protection of civilians and children in armed conflicts will depend on how effectively we are able to tackle the issue of the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons.</p>

	<p id="pg035-bk04-pa01">I should like to commend you, Mr. President, for taking the timely initiative of organizing this open debate in the Security Council on the important issue of small arms. It was only last month that the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects was concluded under the able chairmanship of Colombia, resulting in the Programme of Action. This initiative drew the attention of the international community to the multifaceted problems associated with small arms and light weapons and to the common threat that the illicit trade in such weapons poses to mankind. I should also like to thank Colombia for preparing the document entitled "Issues for the open debate on the question of small arms" (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-732.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/732</a>, annex), which serves as a good basis for our discussion today.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk04-pa02">The landmark United Nations Conference and the resulting Programme of Action marked an important first step in our common effort to combat the scourge of the illicit trade in small arms. Although we have a framework document that is realistic, achievable, and comprehensive, there is a general view that the Programme of Action has not fully met the expectations of the international community, particularly the expectations of the victims of the illicit trade in small arms. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that we are at the beginning, rather than at the end, of a long-term process of mobilizing the international community to tackle this problem. My delegation therefore pledges its support for the follow-up work of the Conference and for ensuring effective implementation of the Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk04-pa03">As expressed in the statement by the President of the Security Council of 24 September 1999, there is a link between the destabilizing accumulation of small arms on the one hand, and threats to international and regional peace and stability on the other. The illicit trade in small arms is also an important factor because it enables such destabilizing accumulations to take place more quickly. But what makes the problem of small arms an even greater threat to international and national peace and stability is its linkage with other problems of national and international concern, such as drug-trafficking, money-laundering and cross-border terrorism, to name a few. It is when small arms are in the hands of these groups of people that the threats to international and regional peace and stability are increased manifold. Thus, if one is to effectively address the small arms issues, one will also have to bear in mind these other associated problems and undertake efforts to resolve them, including, when necessary, by taking action within the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk04-pa04">The problem of small arms not only threatens human security but also impedes sustainable economic development, and with it the development of basic social and public services for individuals. Easy access to small arms and their use by non-State actors, including drug-traffickers, make it very difficult for individuals to lead a normal life, since the propensity to armed violence is increased. The problem of small arms thus has a strong negative impact on both freedom from want and freedom from fear, pillars of human security, and therefore needs to be addressed in all relevant forums. Let us not forget that the root cause of the problem of small arms is conflict itself, and the demand for small arms arises from conflict. We therefore urge the United Nations to continue its good work towards conflict prevention and resolving conflicts at their roots. In this connection, we are pleased that the General Assembly has just adopted a resolution to continue considering the report of the Secretary-General on the prevention of conflict and the recommendations contained therein. In addition, we urge that differences and disputes be settled through political dialogues, negotiations and other peaceful means. This is an area where the Security Council has an important role to play.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk04-pa05">There is no doubt that the Security Council, with its mandate of ensuring international peace and security, has an important contribution to make in addressing the problem of small arms, particularly in countries or regions experiencing armed conflict. The effective design and implementation of arms embargoes, especially in conflict areas, is one area where the Security Council can and does play a pivotal role. But the Security Council should not replace other, more relevant forums at the national and international levels that have already undertaken many initiatives in addressing various issues related to the problem of small arms, issues such as the definition of small arms. The development of norms and measures to tackle the problem of small arms, including the illicit-trafficking of small arms, are best addressed in forums where there is greater universality of membership. This is to ensure transparency and to give our States the opportunity to contribute to the process. We look forward to continued, close cooperation between the Security Council and other relevant forums, including the General Assembly and regional organizations, to jointly address and find effective and practical solutions to the problem of small arms, including the implementation of the Programme of Action of the recent Conference.</p>

I believe it has been a very enriching debate that will enable the Security Council to move forward in its work with a more comprehensive vision of the subject. Again, let me thank all participating delegations. They have shown that the results of our Conference have been positive and constitute the first step in the right direction.</p>
