<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk11">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Amil</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa01">On behalf of the Group of 77 and China, as well as other sponsors, I have the honour to introduce the draft resolution under sub-item (a) of agenda item 64, entitled "New Partnership for Africa's Development: progress in implementation and international support", contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.10-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/L.10/Rev.1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa02">There is much that has been achieved in Africa since the launch of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). It represents the collective determination and commitment of Africa to place its countries on the road to sustainable economic and social development by taking control of its own development and by fighting poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">Today, as we stand at the halfway mark towards 2015, the target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Africa, unfortunately, remains the only continent not on track to achieve the MDGs by 2015. If we are to succeed in eradicating poverty and hunger in Africa, then urgent and concerted action by developed countries and the international community is needed. That obviously entails further strengthening and enhancement of the global partnership for development and vigorous implementation of all development commitments -- in particular the promises that have been made in support of Africa -- without any further delay. Today, the inadequacy of resources is widely seen as the main constraint on African development. While we welcome the support provided by the international community, and the United Nations in particular, much more needs to be done.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa04">It is against that backdrop that the Group of 77 and China submitted the present draft resolution, which requires the attention of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa05">While recognizing the progress made in the implementation of the New Partnership for Africa's Development as well as regional and international support for NEPAD, the draft resolution acknowledges that much needs to be done in its implementation. It recognizes the need for African countries to continue to coordinate, in accordance with their respective national strategies and priorities, all types of external assistance in order to effectively integrate such assistance into their development processes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">The draft resolution calls for comprehensive and sustainable solutions to the challenges faced by African countries, including external debt, the need for coherence in the trade policies towards African countries, the full integration of African countries into the international trading system through initiatives such as building Africa's capacity to compete, and the provision of assistance to address the adjustment challenges of trade liberalization.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa07">While recognizing the need for the international community to make continued efforts to increase the flow of new and additional resources for development financing from all sources -- public and private, domestic and foreign -- to support the development of African countries, the draft resolution calls for the fulfilment of commitments by the developed countries to ensure that the increase in official development assistance translates into an actual flow of financial resources to developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa08">The draft resolution reaffirms the General Assembly's decision to hold a high-level meeting on "Africa's development needs: state of implementation of various commitments, challenges and the way forward" during its sixty-third session and stresses the need for close consultation between the United Nations and the African Union in preparing for the high-level meeting.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">By operative paragraphs 30 and 34 of <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.10-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.10/Rev.1</a>, the General Assembly would reaffirm its decision</p>

	<blockquote id="pg003-bk04-pa05">"to take measures to strengthen the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa in order to enable it to effectively fulfil its mandate, including monitoring and reporting on progress related to meeting the special needs of Africa".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa06">Pursuant to the operative paragraph 30 of the draft resolution, it is understood that the high-level meeting would be held in the context of the regular plenary meetings of the General Assembly. Provision for conference servicing costs for the Assembly's sixty-third session has been included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Any additional conference servicing requirements for related activities, such as parallel meetings of the General Assembly, round tables, hearings and/or panels, will be reviewed and evaluated later, when the format and modalities of this high-level meeting are determined.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa07">Pursuant to operative paragraph 34 of the draft resolution, resources amounting to $7,360,100 before recosting have been provided under subprogramme 1 of section 11, United Nations support for the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, for the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa. Accordingly, adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.10-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.10/Rev.1</a> would not give rise to any financial implications under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Outlule</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa01">On behalf of the Group of African States and all sponsors, I have the honour to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.39.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.39</a>, entitled "2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa02">At the outset, let me make a correction to the text. In operative paragraph 3, in the phrase "through targeted funding from multilateral and bilateral sources", the word "targeted" should be deleted. The paragraph thus reads:</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa03">"Also welcomes the increased funding for malaria interventions and for research and development of preventive and control tools from the international community, through funding from multilateral and bilateral sources and from the private sector ...".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa04">The Group of African States wishes to thank all Member States that participated in the negotiations on the draft resolution. Their contributions enriched the draft, the implementation of which will facilitate the eradication of that deadly disease. We also wish to express our appreciation and gratitude to Mrs. Joyce Kafanabo of the United Republic of Tanzania for skilfully and diligently facilitating the negotiations on this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa05">In introducing the draft resolution, it is our hope that, as in previous years, it will be adopted by consensus, thus reflecting our unity of purpose to eradicate this disease, the vector of which, the anopheles mosquito, is one of the most infamous and insidious insects in the history of human health.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa06">Africa bears an overwhelming proportion of the malaria burden. It costs Africa $12 billion per annum in lost gross domestic product. It consumes up to 34 per cent of household incomes and 40 per cent of Government health spending. But we all know that, with advances in science and technology, malaria is a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa07">Our concerted efforts to roll back malaria are thus imperative because it can be done in a simple, measurable, achievable, realistic way, and within a time-bound period. That is why we speak of the period 2001-2010 for rolling back malaria. We wish to continue to count on the ongoing support and assured assistance of the international community in order to achieve the objective of rolling back malaria by 2010.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa08">The Group of African States is presenting this annual draft resolution as part of our effort to combat malaria and to achieve Millennium Development Goals. In the fight against malaria, we must recognize that defeat is not an option, because with the huge advances in science and technology, it would be a shame to the international community if human civilization were to surrender to the mosquito.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa09">This draft resolution updates a similar resolution adopted last year to take into account new developments and measures to combat malaria. The draft further welcomes the decision by the World Health Assembly to commemorate Malaria Day annually, the increase in funding to combat malaria and the improved predictability of such funding.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa10">We appeal to Member States and the international community as a whole to work in a spirit of cooperation towards effective, increased, harmonized and sustained bilateral and multilateral support to combat malaria.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa11">Once again, it is our wish that this draft resolution be adopted by consensus.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I thank members for their patience in listening to my rather lengthy notes. I request delegations with technical corrections to the texts of draft resolutions adopted by the Second Committee to communicate as soon as possible with the Committee secretariat so that those corrections can be made prior to the issuance of the final texts as resolutions of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">I take this opportunity, to thank the President of the General Assembly most sincerely. I wish also to thank the Chairperson of the Second Committee, Ms. Kirsti Lintonen of Finland, as well as the Vice-Chairpersons, Ms. Melanie Santizo-Sandoval of Guatemala, Mr. Hassan Ali Saleh of Lebanon and Mr. Peter Le Roux of South Africa, for their extraordinary collaboration and partnership.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">I would like sincerely to thank the Secretariat for the outstanding assistance it has provided me and the other members of the Bureau during this session. I also wish to express my gratitude to all the facilitators for their excellent help during our difficult discussions, in particular Mr. Thomas Gass of Switzerland, who spared no effort to achieve consensus on the most difficult text, namely, the draft resolution on the triennial comprehensive policy review.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">Finally, on a more personal note, I would like to take this opportunity to convey my best wishes to those colleagues who are celebrating an important holiday today, as well as to those who just finished celebrating the beautiful Festival of Lights and those who are looking forward to the Christmas holiday. I wish all delegations a wonderful end-of-year celebration and a well-deserved break. Last but not least, I wish all members peace and prosperity in the new year.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa01"> I thank Ms. Tamar Tchitanava of Georgia, Rapporteur of the Second Committee, for her introduction of the Committee's reports.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa02">If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the Second Committee which are before the Assembly today.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk05-pa01"> Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote. The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the Second Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records. May I remind Members that, under paragraph 7 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, the General Assembly agreed that</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk05-pa02">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee".</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk05-pa03">May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk05-pa04">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Second Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Second Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified otherwise in advance. That means that where recorded votes or separate votes were taken, we will do the same. I also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Second Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk05-pa05">The Assembly is reminded that shortly we will be taking action on draft resolutions recommended for adoption by the Second Committee and, thus, those draft resolutions can no longer be additionally sponsored in plenary meeting by Member States. Any corrections delegations may have concerning the reports of the Second Committee, including the listing of sponsors of a draft resolution contained in the reports of the Committee, should be submitted to the secretariat of the Second Committee for the issuance of corrigenda.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk05-pa06">Before proceeding further, I would like to draw the attention of members to a note by the Secretariat distributed desk-to-desk. The note will serve as a reference guide for action on draft resolutions and draft decisions recommended by the Second Committee in its reports.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk03-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of the United States, who wishes to speak in explanation of vote on one of the resolutions just adopted.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rees</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa01">The United States would like to explain its vote with respect to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-183.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 62/183</a>, which is entitled "Unilateral economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries" and was submitted under sub-item (a) of agenda item 52.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa02">The United States opposes this resolution. Every State has the sovereign power to restrict or cut off trade or other commerce with particular nations when the State believes it is in its national economic or security interest to do so or when it serves values about which the nation feels strongly. The suggestion that there is any international legal prohibition against such a right is at best fatuous. That is why so many countries have abstained from supporting the resolution today.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa03">Sanctions are specifically provided for under the United Nations Charter, because the framers saw them as effective, and generally interim, measures -- targeted measures -- that, as part of a broader diplomatic and political strategy, can help the international community to restore peace and security without resort to the use of force. Sanctions should not be used in all cases and must be carefully calibrated to achieve their objectives. In some instances, sanctions are designed to pressure a State to return to generally accepted international norms such as democracy and the rule of law. In other cases, sanctions such as arms embargoes, prohibition on access to nuclear materials and others play a critical role in denying States the tools they need to engage in harmful acts that threaten international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa04">Member States must admit, if only to themselves, that the resolution is actually aimed at undermining the international community's ability to respond effectively to acts that, by their very nature and enormity, are offensive to genuine international norms such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law. There must be consequences for such actions, lest the offending States have no incentive or reason to abandon them.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa05">Economic sanctions, whether multilateral or unilateral, can be, and in fact have been, effective means to achieve legitimate foreign policy objectives. For example, they have cut financial flows to corrupt Powers involved in human rights violations and have also led to a regime's choice to give up nuclear-weapons ambitions. My Government is not prepared to concede that sanctions are not a legitimate and effective tool of statecraft. This resolution will do nothing to change that view.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk14-pa02">Before the Assembly takes action on this draft resolution, I would like to extend my appreciation to the two facilitators -- His Excellency Ambassador Maged Abdelaziz, Permanent Representative of Egypt, and His Excellency Ambassador Johan Lvald, Permanent Representative of Norway -- for their tireless efforts to broker a balanced agreement. I would also like to thank the negotiators representing key groups and individual Member States for the spirit of compromise, professionalism and flexibility that prevailed throughout the extensive informal consultations on this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk14-pa03">As I noted at the opening of this session, financing for development is one of the key priorities for the Assembly. I wish to assure all Member States that it will remain a priority next year as we begin the comprehensive preparatory process, including several multi-stakeholder review sessions on the six thematic areas of the Monterrey Consensus. To ensure an optimal outcome from the Doha Conference, those substantive interactive review sessions should allow participation from experts from capitals and all key stakeholders involved in the Monterrey process. I would also like to see Member States taking a leading role organizing and participating in the sessions. The review session will therefore be given maximum priority, within existing resources and taking into account other informal consultation processes of the General Assembly next year.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk14-pa04">I am confident that, by continuing to work cooperatively and with flexibility, we can produce the first draft of an outcome document by the end of July 2008, which can then serve as the initial basis for a successful outcome of Doha.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk14-pa05">We will now take a decision on the draft resolution, entitled "Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus".

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Carmon</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to express its appreciation to all the original sponsors, to those Member States that joined along the way and to those that voted in support of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-190.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 62/190</a>. We wish also to thank the representative of Finland, Chairperson of the Second Committee, and the facilitator for this resolution, whose leadership was instrumental to this successful outcome. Many thanks also go to you, Mr. President, for the continued interest that you and your Office have demonstrated on this important resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">As this resolution was solely of socio-economic concern, it is regrettable that some delegations felt the need to inject politicization and partisanship into the deliberations and the lengthy process surrounding its adoption. This is a non-political resolution that we feel benefits humankind and the international community as a whole and also bolsters development. My delegation would have preferred for the resolution to be free from all political elements and we were disappointed that it could not be adopted by the Assembly by consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">At the end of this lengthy process, some Member States felt that they could not support the resolution. We respect the decision of some Arab delegations to vote as they did. However, such a decision was the outcome of political circumstances, and not substantive and professional disagreement.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">Nevertheless, my delegation is pleased that this initiative brought together a wide spectrum of sponsors and earned the support of the Assembly. There can be no greater sign of the undeniable importance of this resolution for sustainable development, achieving the Millennium Development Goals and alleviating and improving poor agricultural conditions in developing countries for all of humankind and for the betterment of our shared world. The next step is to implement the resolution. We are determined to set it in motion for the benefit of all Member States.</p>
