	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa01">The General Assembly will now take up agenda item 112 (e) for the election of 47 members of the Human Rights Council, under the terms of reference as outlined in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-251.pdf">resolution 60/251</a> of 15 March 2006.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa02">By adopting <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-251.pdf">resolution 60/251</a> on 15 March, the General Assembly established the Human Rights Council and, by that, further strengthened the United Nations human rights machinery, as mandated by the 2005 world summit outcome. The members of the Assembly agreed to start a new era in the United Nations endeavours to promote and protect human rights. By creating the Human Rights Council as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, they also decided to elevate the institutional standing of the work on human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa03">It is now time to implement that historic achievement. We are here today to elect the first members of the Human Rights Council. The first 47 members will play a crucial role, since they will operationalize and take the first decisions of the Council. I am confident that our colleagues in Geneva will continue to bring the process forward once the members of the Council are elected. It is important that the Council get off to a good start on 19 June.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa04">I am encouraged that, from the start, member States have been guided by the letter and by the spirit of the resolution. The fact that all candidates for election have presented pledges and commitments, in accordance with the resolution, is indeed very encouraging. Those pledges and commitments have been circulated as official documents and posted on the United Nations website to assist members in the election.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa05">I wish to recall that, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-251.pdf">resolution 60/251</a>, when electing members of the Council, member States shall take into account the contributions of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights and their voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa06">We will now proceed to the election, the largest ever conducted in the General Assembly. In connection with this election, a note by the Secretariat has been circulated under the symbol A/INF/60/6.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa07">In accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-251.pdf">resolution 60/251</a>, the 47 seats shall be distributed among the regional groups as follows: 13 seats for the African Group, 13 seats for the Asian Group, 6 seats for the Eastern European Group, 8 seats for the Latin American and Caribbean Group, and 7 seats for the Western European and other Group. The Assembly further decided that membership in the Council shall be open to all States Members of the United Nations. In accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-251.pdf">resolution 60/251</a>, members of the Council shall serve for a period of three years and shall not be eligible for immediate re-election after two consecutive terms. It is further decided that the terms of membership shall be staggered and that such decision will be taken for the first election by the drawing of lots, taking into consideration equitable geographical distribution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa08">Members will recall that in A/INF/60/6 there is a table showing the staggering of terms of the members of each regional group, formulated in line with past practice. May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to approve the staggering of terms of the members of each regional group, as set out in that table?</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa01">Before proceeding further, I wish to inform members that we shall first elect the 47 members of the Human Rights Council. Immediately after the elections are completed, the Assembly will hold the drawing of lots to select from among the members already elected in each regional group those members who will serve for one year, two years and three years, respectively.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa02">The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of the 47 members of the Human Rights Council. In accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-251.pdf">resolution 60/251</a>, the 47 Member States shall be elected directly and individually by secret ballot by the majority of the members of the General Assembly. Accordingly, for the present election, 96 votes constitute a majority in the General Assembly, which has a membership of 191 Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa03">The election will be held in accordance with the relevant rules of procedure of the General Assembly on elections. For this election, rules 92 and 94 of the Assembly's rules of procedure shall be applied. Consistent with the Assembly's practice, if more than the required number of Member States have obtained the votes of the majority of the Assembly members on the same ballot, those Member States that have obtained the largest number of votes above the required majority will be considered as elected, up to the number of seats to be filled.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa04">Also consistent with past practice, in the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a special, restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa05">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to these procedures?</div>
	</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa02">Again, I wish to repeat that the 47 seats are distributed among the regional groups as follows: 13 seats for African Group, 13 seats for the Asian group, 6 seats for the Eastern European Group, 8 seats for the Latin American and Caribbean Group, and 7 seats for the Western European and other Group. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa03">As stated in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-251.pdf">resolution 60/251</a>, when electing members of the Council, Member States shall take into account the contribution of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights and their voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa04">Before we begin the voting process I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the Assembly's rules of procedure, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa05">We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now be distributed. Ballot A has 13 blank lines for the 13 seats for the African Group; Ballot B has 13 blank lines for the 13 seats for the Asian Group; Ballot C has 6 blank lines for the 6 seats for the Eastern European Group; Ballot D has 8 blank lines for the 8 seats for the Latin American and Caribbean Group; and Ballot E has 7 blank lines for the 7 seats for the Western European and other Group.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa06">I request representatives to use only those ballot papers and to write on them the names of the States for which they wish to vote. A ballot paper containing more names from the relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. I repeat, a ballot paper containing more names from the relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. If a ballot paper contains names of Member States that do not belong to that region, those names will not be counted at all.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa07">I will now pause for the distribution of ballot papers and for the writing of 47 names.</div>
