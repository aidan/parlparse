	<div class="p">This morning the General Assembly will proceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1998.</div>
	<div class="p">The 18 outgoing members are Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, the Central African Republic, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, Gabon, Guyana, Jordan, Lebanon, Nicaragua, Romania, the Russian Federation, Sweden, Togo, Tunisia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</div>

The names of these 36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account the number of States which will remain members of the Council after 1 January 1999, the 18 members should be elected as follows: four from African States, three from Latin American and Caribbean States, four from Asian States, four from Western European and other States and three from Eastern European States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to inform the Assembly that the number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to this procedure?</div>
