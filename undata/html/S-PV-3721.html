	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, documents <a href="../pdf/S-1996-813.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/813</a> and Addendum 1.

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lelong</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The delegation of Haiti is gratified to see you, Sir, guiding the work of the Security Council during the month of December. We are convinced that your outstanding qualities and great experience will assist the Council in successfully addressing the important items on its programme of work for this month.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Nugroho Wisnumurti of Indonesia who, in an outstanding manner, guided the Council's deliberations during the month of November.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The Council is today considering a question that is of considerable importance for the democratic process in my country. This is the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), which expired on 30 November.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The Council is well aware of the vital role played by the United Nations peace Mission in improving the situation in Haiti since it was deployed 20 months ago to continue the work of the Multinational Force in Haiti, which had allowed for the establishment of an atmosphere conducive to a return to a constitutional system. The Blue Helmets provided assistance in various areas, ranging from the maintenance of security to the rehabilitation of institutions, as well as in development activities. Thanks to the protective presence of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), the Haitian Government was able to disband the army, which was principally responsible for the political instability and human-rights violations in the country, and to establish the National Police in its place. As for UNSMIH, which followed UNMIH, it has assisted the Government in improving the professionalism of the Police and in maintaining security and stability conducive to the success of ongoing efforts to rebuild the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Thus, considerable progress has been made, at the very least in coping with the crises that have disturbed public order and have recently been settled firmly and calmly by intervention units, in spite of domestic and foreign pressures. It is also gratifying to note that, recently, no acts against human dignity have been committed by any Police personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">I pay tribute here to the actions of all the men and women who have contributed to this progress. We wish to thank the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Haiti, Enrique ter Horst, the commanders of the military and civilian police units and the soldiers and policemen for their devotion. To the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti and to all of those who have worked on this matter and helped us arrive at a solution, we express our deep gratitude. I would like to extend special thanks to Canada and the United States for their specific contributions to the successful implementation of this operation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">Aware that the international community's assistance to the Haitian people in the area of public security will continue to be indispensable to the Haitian Government in its consolidation of democratic gains and pursuit of reform, President Préval has decided to ask the Council to extend the mandate of UNSMIH. This is also the view of the Secretary-General, who, in his report <a href="../pdf/S-1996-813-Add.1.pdf" class="nolink">S/1996/813/Add.1</a> of 14 November 1996, recognizes the role played by the military element of UNSMIH in assisting Haitian authorities to contain the danger of destabilization by forces threatening democracy and recommends the extension of UNSMIH.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">The Haitian delegation is particularly satisfied with the positive outcome of the negotiations that have taken place over the past few days on the extension of UNSMIH's mandate, in the course of which the Council members were able to agree on the draft resolution that the Council is about to adopt unanimously. We should like to thank the delegations involved, in particular those of the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, which have demonstrated understanding towards Haiti and its people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">During the next few months, the Government, assisted by UNSMIH, will be working as fast as it can to strengthen the National Police and to address the innumerable shortcomings which still plague that young corps. In this regard, an in-depth assessment of the Haitian National Police was conducted that allowed us to draw up a precise inventory of that institution, which is in the forefront of the efforts of the Government to establish a state of law in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">Thus, we have identified the Police's specific needs regarding personnel, upper and middle management, basic and advanced training, housing, <i>matériel</i>, office equipment, transportation, and so on. On that basis, a schedule of activities has been drawn up to ensure that, before the end of next year, the Haitian National Police achieves a satisfactory level of efficiency and is in a position to maintain peace and security throughout our national territory.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">But, as is so well stated in the preamble of the draft resolution, there is a link between peace and development. If the efforts to consolidate democracy and to maintain social stability are to bear fruit, a fierce struggle must be waged against the poverty and unemployment that afflict a significant part of the population. The disastrous state of our economy does not allow the Government to meet the basic needs of the population for food, health care and education. The infrastructure of the country remains largely dilapidated, rendering living conditions in the country extremely difficult.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">This serious socio-economic situation is a breeding ground exploited by subversive groups to sow anxiety and maintain a climate of instability that harms economic investment and hinders the reform of institutions. The release of international assistance, following the adoption by Parliament of laws on the modernization of public enterprises and civil service reform, should allow the Government to launch long-awaited infrastructure projects employing a great deal of manual labour. These should have a positive impact on the country's economy and reduce unemployment.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">In the same context, we have just launched a programme for agrarian reform designed to renew agricultural production and give the peasants in the countryside, who constitute more than 60 per cent of the population, the means to cultivate their lands. There are also Governmental initiatives designed to ease the poverty in which the people are gripped.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">Only two years after Haiti returned in constitutional legality with the assistance of the international community, the prospects are indeed encouraging. Every day, democracy is gaining strength in the customs and habits of the nation. The construction of a state of law is advancing steadily. The establishment of infrastructure for economic development is continuing. The success of this experiment in Haiti -- making the transition from dictatorship to democracy -- is also a success for the international community, which, since 1990, has been at the side of the Haitian people in its quest for justice, democracy and a better life.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01"> I thank the Permanent Representative of Haiti for his kind words addressed to me. The next speaker is the Permanent Representative of Canada. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Canada is very pleased that the Security Council is considering the present draft resolution on the situation in Haiti. We are gratified to see that all the members of the Council continue to support the efforts of the freely elected Government and the people of Haiti to strengthen democracy and rebuild their country.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">From the outset, Canada has had a particular interest in the United Nations efforts to promote democracy and stability in Haiti. Haiti is a neighbour with which we have had close relations for decades and with which we share a common francophone heritage. Many Haitians have found refuge in Canada during periods of dictatorship and oppression. In Canada, we are proud of our strong and thriving Haitian community.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Stability in Haiti is a key to the continuing security of the Caribbean region and to the development of democracy in our hemisphere. That is why Canada played a leading role within the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) and now within the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">We consider that the United Nations presence in Haiti has been successful in fulfilling its very ambitious mandate. UNMIH provided the underlying stability required for the consolidation of democracy and the increase in the respect for human rights in Haiti. It created conditions conducive to the effective recruitment, training and deployment of the Haitian National Police. Further, it established a stable climate that enabled democratic elections for Parliament and local governments to take place, and which allowed for a democratic transition of power from President Aristide to President Préval last February.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Finally, the United Nations Mission in Haiti enabled the Haitian Government to reach agreement with the international financial institutions on a structural adjustment programme that will provide the basis for the future economic development of the country. I should like, on behalf of Canada, to congratulate the Government of Haiti for the determination it has shown in making the difficult decisions that will establish a firm foundation for the future economic and social development of Haiti.</p>

<div class="italicline-spokein" id="pg004-bk01">
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01"><i>spoke in English</i></p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Canada is pleased that the Security Council is considering extending the mandate of UNSMIH for a period of six months, renewable for a further period of two months. This essentially meets President Préval's request for a continuing presence over the next eight months, should that be necessary. We believe it will provide the Mission with the opportunity to continue to make a valuable contribution to the establishment of an effective and independent Haitian National Police. With respect to troop levels, we want to underline the fact that to accomplish its mandate, the Mission will continue to require a minimum of 1,300 personnel. This figure was arrived at after a very careful evaluation of the tasks to be performed and the risks that they entail. Developments over the first five months of UNSMIH's mandate have, in retrospect, convinced us that this number remains appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">We will continue, therefore, to make a voluntary contribution to the Mission of significant proportions, as we have no choice but to ensure that UNSMIH has the resources it needs to accomplish its mandate. Canada will maintain its current commitment to UNSMIH over the course of the renewed mandate, which includes 100 police officers who are part of the United Nations civilian police, and 750 military personnel deployed in Port-au-Prince. As we have been doing since March 1996, we will be providing part of our contingent as a voluntary contribution, as a sign of the strength of our commitment to the people of Haiti and, indeed, as further evidence of our belief in effective United Nations peacekeeping. As a result of this contribution and of that made by the United States, Haiti is benefiting from a full peacekeeping mission at a very small cost to United Nations Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">We also note that the draft resolution mentions that the upcoming mandate renewal will constitute UNSMIH's last. We believe that it is vitally important that we all recognize the import of this decision and of the fact that we will, as a result, be entering a transition period in Haiti. The need for a peacekeeping mission is coming to an end. At the same time, it is clear that the need for peace-building activities continues.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">We believe that peace-building is becoming ever more important as a tool of international crisis management. It is essential that there be a civilian equivalent to the military response that peacekeeping provides. Once peacekeeping has stabilized a situation, as is now occurring in Haiti, activities that strengthen democracy and civil society become vitally important as the conditions for economic development and long-term stability are put in place and nurtured. The Secretary-General's recommendations on the nature of a subsequent international presence in Haiti, which will build on the achievements of UNMIH and UNSMIH, will be particularly important in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">A large part of Canada's bilateral assistance in Haiti is dedicated to peace-building activities and includes the provision of specialized training to the Haitian National Police, the reform of the justice system, electoral assistance, cooperation with the Haitian Parliament, and projects to strengthen Haitian civil society and promote human rights. We are convinced that through such programmes, we are complementing the efforts of the United Nations system to build the foundations of a stable, democratic Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">The next eight-month period will be crucial for the United Nations involvement in Haiti. We believe we must take full advantage of this time to complete UNSMIH's work and to prepare a smooth transition to a different kind of international engagement in Haiti, while we continue to seek to buttress public security. To ensure that this objective is achieved, we urge other countries, agencies and institutions to join us in providing generous and timely assistance to the Government of Haiti.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Ramírez</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">The Security Council is considering the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH). We view this with great satisfaction, as it would mean the culmination of a process leading to a lasting solution to the protracted and painful Haitian situation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">I wish first of all to express appreciation for the comprehensive reports of the Secretary-General dated 1 October and 14 November 1996. While the reports state that during July, August and September last, the wave of violence subsided, we believe that much still remains to be done in terms of consolidating domestic security and strengthening institutions in order to guarantee a State based fully on the rule of law that respects human rights and individual freedoms.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">We believe that the United Nations, which has invested a considerable amount of resources in the process of stabilization, must remain attentive to the evolution of the process.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">Allow me to emphasize once again the important role being played by the United Nations Civilian Police. The task of assisting the Government of Haiti in the professionalization of the civilian police and in the maintenance of a secure and stable environment is not a simple one. Nevertheless, the results have been encouraging. The most recent report of the Secretary-General informs us that progress has been made in the areas of respect for human rights and compliance with professional standards. We believe that this new institution is of significant importance in consolidating democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">I also wish to convey my country's recognition for the efforts undertaken by the Organization of American States, in particular for the contribution of the International Civilian Mission in Haiti (MICIVIH) in promoting democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">The Republic of Argentina also acknowledges in particular the crucial role of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Haiti, Mr. Ter Horst, in coordinating the activities of the United Nations system and in the promotion of democratic institutions, national reconciliation and economic rehabilitation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">Economic rehabilitation and reconstruction represent important challenges for the people of Haiti. We trust that soon the generosity of the international community will make itself felt strongly in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">Aware of the magnitude of these challenges, the Government of Argentina is firmly committed to assisting in the socio-economic reconstruction of Haiti, a commitment that is reflected in our decision to cooperate, through the "White Helmets" initiative, in providing drinking water and in the dispatch of medical personnel and social workers. In this connection, Argentina enjoys the valuable and active cooperation of the Government of France.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">Argentina has been committed to the Government and the people of Haiti ever since the re-establishment of democracy on 15 October 1994. Two months later, in December of that year, the Government of Argentina sent a high-level mission to discuss with the Haitian authorities opportunities for cooperation. That mission resulted in a number of projects, some of which have already been successfully completed and others that are under way.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa10">We also eagerly await President Préval's visit to Argentina, which will undoubtedly help to cement our excellent relations with Haiti, a country with a rich and diverse culture that has suffered ignominious dictatorship and that has taught us so much on its road to freedom.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">Allow me first to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of December.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">It is a pleasure for my country to be a sponsor of the draft resolution now before the Security Council for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">We are linked to Haiti by history and by geography, which has led us to play an active role in its process of stabilization and democratic consolidation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Venezuela commends and praises the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti for the considerable progress it has made in fulfilling its mandate to lend assistance to the Government of Haiti in maintaining a secure and stable environment. The Mission faced its most difficult test earlier this year, on 7 February, with the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected President to another President who had also been democratically elected. Ten months have passed since that event, and we have noted that the process of democratization has not been halted. We have continued to see progress, and successful steps continue to be taken.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">The reduction in numbers of the military component has demonstrated that the Mission has borne tangible and concrete fruit, and we expect that, gradually but firmly, Haiti will advance towards the reconstruction of the country and the creation and stabilization of free and permanent institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">In this connection, I must take this opportunity to give well-deserved credit to the work of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti and to point out that its consolidation will make possible the long-term success of the educational and institutional process in Haiti. We have confidence in the work being carried out jointly by the United Nations and the Organization of American States in this sphere.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">We all know that the Government and the people of Haiti bear ultimate responsibility for the political, economic and social reconstruction of their country, for the Haitian people are the fundamental actors and interlocutors in the country's democratization process. However, we also know that in order to achieve lasting peace and stability we need the sustained commitment of the international community. Without the support and solidarity of the international community, it is impossible to achieve effective progress in the world, whether in the democratization process or in the protection of human rights and the environment.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">In this regard, we welcome the new extension of the mandate of the Support Mission, for the sudden withdrawal of forces would be ill advised, and we must make provisions to end the operation in a satisfactory manner.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">In conclusion, and in keeping with paragraph 7 of the draft resolution before the Council, I wish to express Venezuela's political determination to continue to lend its support to this cause. As Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Venezuela to the United Nations, I am especially pleased to support and endorse this draft resolution.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa01">The United Nations operation in Haiti is one of the great recent successes of the Organization. It has allowed for a consolidation of that country's transition to democracy by assisting the Government to form a public force respectful of legality and capable of maintaining public order and security.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa02">The task undertaken by the United Nations was not an easy one. Indeed, the restoration of a State of law in a country that had little recent experience of democracy required making a clean sweep of the former military and police structures. This is why the effort to set up a democratic institutional framework in Haiti would have been inconceivable without the accompaniment and support of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa03">Since the adoption on 28 June 1996 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1063(1996).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1063 (1996)</a> creating the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), real progress has been made in strengthening the Haitian National Police. That progress is highlighted in the report the Secretary-General has submitted. In particular, we note the arrival of new police personnel, a more rational geographical deployment, improved logistical methods that will afford the police greater visibility and mobility and, lastly, better-trained police officers and a clear and better-applied code of conduct.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa04">Such progress in structure and method has begun to be reflected in the field by an improvement in Haitian security. The acts of violence that marked the months of July, August and September have abated. Successes have been recorded in the fight against crime.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa05">This progress is praiseworthy and is due to the efforts of the Haitian authorities and the support of the United Nations. But it is still fragile. The National Police continues to suffer from a lack of personnel, professionalism, equipment and management. The Haitian National Police must cope with the double challenge of rising common crime and the continuing activity of small political factions that, unfortunately, remain determined to threaten democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa06">That is why France immediately heeded the appeal of President Préval to the Secretary-General to extend the mandate of UNSMIH beyond 30 November and supports the recommendation of the Secretary-General, which is in line with the request of President Préval. We participated with the group of "Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti" in drawing up the draft resolution submitted to the Council, which sets a timetable for the deployment, conduct and the end of this Mission. France, therefore, will vote in favour of this text.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa07">We are pleased to hail the extra effort that Canada has agreed to make to maintain the level of the troops participating in the operation. We recognize, of course, that the major responsibility falls to the Government and the people of Haiti and we are pleased yet again to hail the efforts made by the Haitian nation. Those efforts deserve our continuous assistance to the Haitian authorities on the courageous and democratic path they have chosen. France, as I have just said, will therefore be pleased to vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fedotov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">The Russian delegation notes with satisfaction the</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">recent progress made towards consolidating democracy and constitutional order in Haiti and the establishment of the new Haitian police. The highest praise goes to the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), which is responsibly carrying out the tasks that have been entrusted to it by the Security Council. We should like to express our gratitude to the staff of this Mission, among whom are our compatriots, for their tireless efforts to support and strengthen democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">As we have stated on numerous occasions, the Russian Federation had doubts regarding the necessity to extend the mandate of this Mission, and in particular to preserve its military element, and our position in this regard remains unchanged. It is our profound conviction that the situation in that country did not and does not represent a threat to international or even regional peace and security. It has lost the specific characteristics on account of which we once agreed to the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping operation there.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">At the same time, taking into account the appeal of the President of Haiti, Mr. René Préval, the recommendation of the Secretary-General and the views of the group of "Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti", Russia agrees, in principle and in the spirit of compromise, to a final extension of the UNSMIH mandate for a concluding eight-month period.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">At the same time, if in the light of the Secretary-General's report in March next year, the Security Council deems it possible to conclude this operation two months earlier, by 31 May 1997, we will be ready to support such a proposal. The principal thing is that it be clearly spelt out by the draft resolution's sponsors that the mandate of UNSMIH is being extended for a final time. And this time will, indeed, be final.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">At this stage, provisions have already been made for a reduction in the military element of 100 people financed by the United Nations and for the Secretary-General to submit future recommendations regarding further reduction in the size of the Mission. Thus, the bases have been laid for a phased, full withdrawal of the military elements of the United Nations from Haiti by the time the mandate of UNSMIH is ended.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">All United Nations operations must, in one way or another, be time-bound. The maintenance of a significant United Nations presence in Haiti in the form of military elements, particularly against the backdrop of the far more drastic crisis situations in other regions of the world and the extremely difficult financial situation of the Organization, could be perceived as a manifestation of double standards, especially when one takes into account the totally different attitude towards other truly critical and more volatile flashpoints.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">As for Haiti's potential difficulties, <i>inter alia</i>, in the area of internal security, after the withdrawal of UNSMIH they will have to be resolved not by means of United Nations peacekeeping operations but rather with the assistance of mechanisms external to the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">At the same time, we will be ready to consider recommendations of the Secretary-General regarding the possible nature and form of a subsequent international presence in Haiti, as provided for in the draft resolution. In this context, it is important that the draft resolution single out the high-priority tasks of the economic rehabilitation and reconstruction of Haiti. The Russian Federation has often expressed its view regarding the fact that the major cause for the continuing problems of that country is its difficult socio-economic situation. We are convinced that only a speedy recovery of the economic situation and stable development in Haiti can provide a truly sound foundation for lasting stability and the further strengthening of democracy in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">As regards external support for reform and development programmes, there must be significant and decisive action and coordination of international efforts by the United Nations specialized agencies, international financial organizations, including the Bretton Woods institutions, donor States and neighbouring and interested countries.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, I must emphasize that our work on the draft resolution demonstrated once again that constructive approaches and mutual respect for positions and interests help the members of the Council to find universally acceptable decisions. We are grateful to the sponsors of the draft for its reflection of a number of the basic elements of our approach, although we would have preferred more radical reductions in the United Nations military element. Nevertheless, in the light of all of the views stated above, our delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wisnumurti</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">It is with great pleasure that my delegation expresses its congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of December. We are convinced that your leadership, vast experience and diplomatic skill will guide the Council effectively through its work during this month. My delegation pledges its full support and cooperation in discharging your task and responsibility. I myself would like to express deep gratitude for your kind and generous words addressed to me as President of the Security Council for last month at the Council meeting yesterday.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Today we are going to decide on the future of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH). In this regard, the Indonesian delegation extends its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on UNSMIH (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-813.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/813</a>). My delegation is gratified to note that the security situation has improved because of the presence of UNSMIH and the enhanced capacity of the Haitian National Police (HNP). UNSMIH has played a significant role in training, supporting and enhancing the capacity of the HNP, as well as in maintaining security. Hence, we would like to commend UNSMIH on its efforts in effectively assisting the Government of Haiti to professionalize the HNP, which in turn creates a more stable environment in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">However, the report suggests that the situation in Haiti is still fluid. The weight of Haiti's past continues to create many obstacles, undermining further progress in rebuilding Haiti economically, socially and institutionally. The most dire threat to Haiti's future development lies in the violence caused by the militant groups opposed to the present Government. Furthermore, a high level of criminality and disgruntled former soldiers continue to contribute to potentially dangerous outcomes.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">At this juncture, the HNP is not yet prepared to meet fully the complex difficulties that Haiti is confronted with. The HNP's institutional and operational capacities still need to be developed further. Indeed, it is crucial that the HNP become, with the shortest of delays, a professional, self-sustaining and fully functioning national police force of adequate size and structure, so that this organization is able to conduct the full spectrum of police functions with the appropriate leadership at all echelons of its hierarchy. It is also in this context that Indonesia considers it essential for Haiti not only to strengthen the HNP, but also to establish an effective and strong judiciary system in order to overcome the multi-faceted challenges the Haitian Government has to face.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">The promotion and consolidation of peace and democracy is essential in order for Haiti to preserve and maintain peace and stability in the long term. We therefore welcome the regional contribution of the Organization of American States (OAS) in cooperation with the United Nations, in particular the contribution of the International Civilian Mission in Haiti (MICIVIH). This also demonstrates how meaningful cooperation between regional organizations and the United Nations can be in handling a conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">The Organization, of course, can also provide technical assistance to ensure the continuity of its activities. It is in this connection that we support the role of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in coordinating different activities to achieve the long-term goals of institution-building, national reconciliation and economic rehabilitation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">The future of Haiti will depend in large measure on the rehabilitation and reconstruction of its economy, without which Haiti will return to a state of political turmoil and conflict. There is indeed a link between peace or political stability and development. In this regard, operative paragraph 4 of today's draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-1002.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/1002</a>) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic, social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">The presence of UNSMIH, in our view, is a reflection of the international community's commitment to restoring democracy in this country. Therefore, my delegation has no difficulty in supporting operative paragraph 2 of this draft resolution, which recommends the extension of UNSMIH's mandate until 31 May 1997, with a possible final extension until 31 July 1997. The continuous presence of UNSMIH, in our view, will ensure the development of a professional, self-sustaining, fully functioning national police force able to conduct the full spectrum of police functions for the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti's system of justice.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Based upon these considerations, Indonesia will vote in favour of this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, we would like to extend our deep appreciation to the men and women of UNSMIH, who have carried out their work with diligence and professionalism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Indonesia for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Qin Huasun</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Thanks to the efforts of the Haitian Government and people, and the assistance of the international community, the peace process in Haiti continues to move in a favourable direction. The political situation in Haiti has improved further and the society is generally stable. The law enforcement capabilities of the Haitian police have also been notably enhanced. The Chinese delegation is pleased with these welcome developments.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">China supports the peace process in Haiti. I myself once had the opportunity to see what was happening in Haiti. The efforts by the Haitian Government to maintain political and social stability will help create a favourable environment in Haiti to attract foreign financial assistance and investment. This will also contribute to economic reconstruction in the country and the improvement of the people's living standards.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">We believe that under the current circumstances the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti is over. The main task now facing Haiti is economic reconstruction, which will mainly depend on the Haitian people themselves. In this connection, the international community, particularly the international financial institutions and other United Nations agencies, should play an active role.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">In view of the urgent request of the Haitian Government for the extension of the mandate of UNSMIH, we are ready to treat it as a unique case, so as to promote further the peace process in Haiti. The draft resolution before us (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-1002.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/1002</a>) has not only accommodated the request of the Haitian Government, but has also taken into proper consideration the actual needs and positions of all those concerned. We will therefore vote in favour of this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">We hope that the Haitian Government will continue its efforts to maintain social stability and speed up economic reconstruction so that the Haitian people will be able to live and work in peace and happiness at an early date.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martínez Blanco</span> <span class="nation">Honduras</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa01">My delegation has taken note of the fact that the Government of Haiti is continuing its efforts to consolidate democracy in the country and to resolve the various economic, social and institutional problems which impede its development. Nevertheless, the efforts made in the transition to democracy in Haiti continue to be threatened, as the security climate in the country remains only relative because of the increase in crime and the presence of groups or persons with links to the previous de facto regime who could undertake destabilizing actions against the legitimately elected Government.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa02">As indicated by the President of Haiti, René Préval, in his communication addressed to the Secretary-General of last 13 November (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-956.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/956</a>), progress has been made towards solving Haiti's security problems thanks to the assistance given by the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) to the Haitian National Police (HNP). However, he indicated that assistance from the international community continues to be necessary in order to guarantee a stable and secure environment in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa03">Honduras fully shares the wish expressed by the Government of Haiti that the mandate of UNSMIH be extended. We believe that the necessary climate of security must exist in Haiti to enable its Government to devote its full attention to solving the major economic and social problems it faces and to promoting reconciliation among the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa04">If violence in Haiti has diminished in recent months, this has been due to the training received so far by the Haitian National Police from the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti. However, the police has not yet attained the level of experience and confidence necessary to control the problems of crime, drug trafficking and the presence of armed groups opposed to the Government.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa05">The extension of the UNSMIH mandate is necessary to complete the professionalization of the Haitian police and to continue motivating its performance in Port-au-Prince and the rest of the country, and thus to be able to create the secure and stable environment needed by the people and Government of Haiti in order to promote national reconciliation, strengthen the administration of justice, consolidate the democratic system and stimulate the country's economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa06">For those reasons, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Eitel</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">We welcome the improvements outlined in the addendum to the Secretary-General's report on the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) of 12 November 1996 (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-813-Add.1.pdf" class="nolink">S/1996/813/Add.1</a>), especially in regard to the improvement of the security situation in Haiti. Fortunately, the rebuilding of the police force has slowly but surely acquired its own momentum, as the Secretary-General stated in his report.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">Moreover, we commend the Canadian Government for its initiative and active role in the operation. We also commend the efforts of President Préval and his Government, who are showing their determination to consolidate democracy and the rule of law, to make the necessary institutional changes and to address the social and economic problems that the people of Haiti have to face. Germany welcomes those commitments, as well as the determination of the Haitian authorities, to uphold human rights and to ensure the accountability of human rights violators.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">However, we continue to be concerned that, as the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-813.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/813</a>) states, over the last year common crime among Haiti's civilian population has increased considerably, including some forms of dangerous criminality such as drug-trafficking and the greater use of firearms.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">We therefore agree with the report's conclusion that so far the Haitian National Police has not reached the level of experience and confidence necessary to tackle successfully the problems created by previous members of the security forces, nor to deal with the day-to-day problems a police force usually encounters. It is clear, therefore, that UNSMIH's military element is, for the time being, a key factor in the ability to contain the danger of destabilization.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">We urge the Government of Haiti, but also the United Nations agencies, to implement a plan of action for the reintegration of former soldiers of the disbanded armed forces of Haiti into civil society. To neglect that issue is to neglect an important aspect of peace-building in an emerging, socially balanced democratic society.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">We strongly condemn the fact that those small groups of former members of the Haitian armed forces, acting in concert with political figures associated with the previous undemocratic regime, still have access to funding and weapons. Recent information suggests that a number of those groups may be using neighbouring countries as a base. Those groups are therefore still in a position to threaten and damage Government installations and infrastructure, and are believed to be planning future challenges to the democratically elected Government of President Préval, seeking to undermine its efforts to stabilize democratic structures and promote economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">We are also deeply concerned that judicial reform in Haiti is not keeping pace with the progress already achieved in reforming the Haitian National Police. When 80 per cent of the people incarcerated nationwide are in pre-trial detention, it seems obvious that the court system is largely unable to process judicial cases adequately. We therefore urge CIVPOL, the civilian police component of UNSMIH, to concentrate resources and expertise more on the fundamental reform of the justice system.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The members of the Security Council, in agreeing to the final extension of UNSMIH's mandate, have proved once again that the international community is willing to cooperate with and support the efforts of the Haitian Government to rebuild the country.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">Germany has actively supported the efforts of the international community to consolidate the democratic and economic restructuring of Haiti. Bilaterally, we have earmarked almost DM 110 million for 1996 for economic cooperation with Haiti. The main focus of that cooperation is a food security programme.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">We truly hope that the final extension of UNSMIH's mandate will create the necessary security conditions in Haiti for the transition to a successful post-conflict peace-building phase. On the basis of those considerations, Germany will vote in favour of this draft resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Park</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti and the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) troop-contributing countries for their untiring efforts to restore peace and consolidate democracy in Haiti. We are particularly grateful to the Governments of Canada and the United States for their voluntary support for UNSMIH.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Since the establishment of UNSMIH last June, there have been many positive developments. During the last few months, in particular, we have witnessed slow but steady improvement in the security situation in Haiti and in the capacity of the Haitian National Police (HNP) to confront the existing challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Even so, the progress made has not been sufficient to warrant termination of UNSMIH's mandate at this stage. It is clear from the Secretary-General's report and its recent addendum that the security situation in Haiti is still fragile and requires the continued support of the international community. Although the swell of violence of last summer has abated significantly, the report of the Secretary-General clearly indicates the enormous potential for instability.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">Against that backdrop, the delay in the institutional development of the Haitian National Police is a source of serious concern. Despite some positive developments in recent months, the HNP must still deal with many shortcomings in critical areas. The young police force not only lacks the necessary equipment, but is also largely inexperienced and in need of leadership to cope with the daunting challenges of maintaining law and order on its own.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">In the light of the less than satisfactory situation described here, my delegation concurs with the Secretary-General's observation that the presence of UNSMIH with its civilian and military components continues to be required. It is necessary not only for the successful completion of the professionalization of the HNP, but also to consummate the investment made by the international community in the restoration of democracy and a secure environment in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Needless to say, the United Nations cannot maintain its presence in Haiti indefinitely. In this regard, we are pleased that the draft resolution recognizes that the people of Haiti themselves bear the ultimate responsibility for shaping their future, and that it also states clearly that this is to be the final extension of the mandate of UNSMIH. It is therefore the earnest hope of my delegation that the Government and the people of Haiti, together with the international community, will make optimum use of the coming six to eight months for the smooth transition from the peacekeeping to the peace-building phase.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">I should like to reiterate in this regard the view we have consistently held that, from the long-term perspective, the genuine security of that nation cannot be ensured unless the basic living conditions of its people are improved through social and economic development. We note with satisfaction that operative paragraph 4 of the draft resolution recognizes that economic rehabilitation and reconstruction constitute the major tasks facing the Haitian Government and people. My delegation therefore hopes that the subsequent presence of the international community, envisaged in operative paragraph 7 of the draft resolution, could be geared towards these tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">With these remarks, the Republic of Korea is pleased to join the consensus of the Council and vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir John Weston</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">The United Kingdom is in favour of extending the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), as proposed in the draft resolution before us. We are firmly of the view that the continuation of UNSMIH's work in Haiti is essential to maintain the peace and stability of that country. We are grateful to all the contributors to UNSMIH, in particular Canada and the United States, for their crucial role in ensuring the success of the Mission so far.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">We are pleased to note the Secretary-General's assessment that the security situation in Haiti continues to improve. However, the danger of destabilization by armed opposition groups remains. Violent crime is on the increase and is a cause for concern. The Haitian National Police is still at the fledgling stage of its development and is not yet capable of taking full responsibility for public security. That is why the continuing support of the international community is so important.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">The United Kingdom commends the Government of Haiti for its efforts in support of UNSMIH. We must all work with the Government to ensure that governmental and judicial institutions are strengthened to give Haiti the necessary foundations for a stable democracy. We hope that the necessary reforms of the judiciary will be implemented soon, relieving the pressure on the court system.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">Haiti has been a success story for the United Nations. We recognize that the United Nations has remained in Haiti longer than originally envisaged. But we must not now endanger our previous investment in peace in Haiti through precipitate actions that could threaten the stability of that country.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Legwaila</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">Botswana is delighted that the Security Council has reached consensus on the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) until 31 May 1997. The contribution that UNSMIH is making to the betterment of the lives of the ordinary people of Haiti is beyond doubt: violence has abated somewhat in recent weeks, and the security situation has improved, along with the capacity of the Haitian National Police (HNP) to deal with the challenges facing it. These are no mean achievements in a country in which the culture of violence has been a dominant factor for generations. The people of Haiti undoubtedly welcome and appreciate the role of the international community in assisting them to rebuild a more stable and peaceful society.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">While it is important to acknowledge the achievements made thus far, it is essential to recognize that the process of rebuilding a democratic and politically stable Haiti remains fragile and reversible. There is clear evidence that some former members of the Armed Forces of Haiti, which have been responsible for politically motivated violence in the past, still have access to funding and weapons. They are ready to destabilize the Government at any time, and they therefore pose a serious threat to Haiti's transition to democracy. Suggestions that some of these groups may be using neighbouring countries as a base need to be taken seriously. The international community, and the neighbouring countries in particular, must do all they can to ensure that political instability, economic stagnation and undemocratic rule do not return to Haiti, with all the attendant regional implications.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">It is encouraging to note that the Haitian National Police has shown marked improvement in the execution of its duties and increased accountability, which in turn inspire public confidence in police protection. However, the easy availability of weapons, the high incidence of armed criminal activity and the fact that the first police officers graduated only 18 months ago are clear indications that the HNP faces formidable challenges in its efforts to maintain a secure and stable environment.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Botswana supports the Secretary-General's observation in paragraph 6 of the Addendum to his report that for now the military and civilian police components of UNSMIH should be maintained at current strengths subject, of course, to constant reviews, depending on the improvements in the political situation on the ground. UNSMIH is still very necessary to help the HNP consolidate its hold on the security situation in Haiti. My delegation therefore welcomes with appreciation the flexibility that was demonstrated by members of the Council in reaching agreement on operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution that we are about to adopt. I extend the gratitude of my delegation to the "Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti" for the tireless efforts they have made to accommodate the concerns of all members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">The economic rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Haitian national economy is an indispensable part of the consolidation of peace and democracy in that country. It will be difficult to rebuild stable national institutions when the mass of the people do not have a stake in the economy of the country. In this respect, we commend the countries that have contributed generously to the Trust Fund or made concessional resources available to the Government of Haiti. These contributions, as well as the dedication and commitment to duty of the men and women of UNSMIH, are monumental in the stabilization of Haiti. We encourage them to continue the good work.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial, material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission. What is of paramount importance is that, when a peacekeeping mission is withdrawn from theatre, there should be no need for redeployment within a relatively short period of time. In other words, UNSMIH should, at the end of the day, leave behind a stable and prosperous country and a people that can look to the future with pride and dignity. My delegation in therefore pleased that operative paragraph 7 of the draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to submit a report by 31 March 1997 that includes recommendations on the nature of a future international presence in Haiti.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wlosowicz</span> <span class="nation">Poland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">When my delegation took the floor on 28 June 1996 on the occasion of the adoption of the Security Council resolution setting up the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), it expressed its firm belief that the international community has an obligation to assist the Government and the people of Haiti in their struggle for stability and normalcy in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">Today, when we are about to extend the mandate of UNSMIH for the last time, with the actual date of its expiration being either 31 May 1997 or the end of July 1997, we find our earlier conviction still to be valid. Indeed, there has been considerable progress in the peaceful resolution of conflict in Haiti. The Haitian Government has started regulating the economy and the social infrastructure of that country, both of which are of paramount importance for properly addressing and eventually resolving the problems that persist there. It is our hope that the new laws concerning in particular the modernization of State enterprises and the status of the civil service will add new momentum to the process of normalization, which was stalled until recently.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Similarly, we welcome the improvements in the security situation in Haiti. We have taken note of some positive trends -- however limited they still may be -- in the functioning of the Haitian National Police Force in the capital as well as in other regions of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">Yet it is clear, from the report of the Secretary-General as well as from numerous other sources, that notwithstanding all the progress that has been made to date, the Haitian authorities are still not in a position to secure the kind of environment they need to carry out the economic, institutional and judicial reforms to which they have committed themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">Generally speaking, the security situation in Haiti continues to cause us concern. The Haitian National Police is in clear need of further strengthening. It requires more training, equipment and better coordination of its activities. The justice system in Haiti should also be profoundly reformed. In the view of the Secretary-General, it is characterized by a continuing inability to respond professionally to existing challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">The international community has been assisting Haiti in its quest for security and stability since the restoration of constitutional order. In our opinion, there are compelling reasons to continue this assistance in order to facilitate the difficult transition to normality and democracy in that country. This is also the wish of the Haitian authorities, as stated in the letter from President Réne Préval requesting the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH).</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">It is for these reasons that the Polish delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution extending the mandate of UNSMIH, thereby paving the way for different forms of cooperation between the Haitians and the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">Finally, I should like to pay tribute to the members of UNSMIH and to their Governments, which have been extremely generous in their approach to the situation in Haiti.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cabral</span> <span class="nation">Guinea-Bissau</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">Consideration of the Secretary-General's report on the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) has enabled members of the Security Council to engage in an in-depth analysis of the situation prevailing in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">Our delegation greatly appreciates the efforts of the United Nations, and of the international community in general, to provide all necessary assistance to the Haitian people. We cannot overstate the full political, economic and even psychological importance of the presence of the international community on this island, whose inhabitants are attempting, against all odds, to take control of their own destiny and to create conditions for a decent and peaceful life.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">The Haitian people, who for decades languished in the throes of a brutal and bloody dictatorship, deserves both the attention we are devoting to it and the assistance it needs to establish the foundation of a democracy based on the primacy of law and on respect for the human person.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">We are gratified to note that the other speakers also acknowledge this important axiom, which must motivate our actions to promote and establish peace and security in the country. We are indeed speaking of peace and security when we refer to the situation in Haiti. The Government of President Préval is making every effort to guarantee the Haitian people the right to live without fear of the future by creating the necessary conditions of stability and security. But we know that, unfortunately, the means available to the Haitian authorities are very limited.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">At this critical stage, the presence of UNSMIH remains indispensable in strengthening the pillars of the democratic process while ensuring respect for constitutional order.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">Haiti is a poor country, but it is also a country whose aspirations to democracy are deeply rooted in the culture of its people, a people very close and dear to those of us on the African continent. The democratic experience in Haiti serves as a symbol, endowing the concept of international solidarity with true meaning. In helping the Haitian people throw off the yoke of dictatorship, the international community has unquestionably contributed to the emergence of democracy and of political pluralism in this part of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">The genuine progress made in Haiti testifies to the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in building democracy in that country. The presence of the United Nations is still required to enhance the possibility for success of a freely chosen Government, one whose actions are based on legitimate aspirations of the Haitian people, a people to which it is fitting here and now to pay a richly deserved tribute for its courage, its spirit of self-sacrifice and its determination. We must recall the history of Haiti to understand and appreciate the comments made here today.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">On behalf of my delegation, I should like to note our gratification at the fact that Haiti remains a concern and an example of a continuing commitment on the part of the international community. Indeed, it could not be otherwise, for we are aware of the financial and other implications of UNSMIH's presence in Haiti. However, solidarity towards the people of Haiti requires that the actions of the United Nations not be viewed solely through the distorting lens of financial considerations. Without a well-organized and effective National Police, there can be no security in Haiti. Without assistance from the international community, the democratic process in Haiti is likely to become bogged down. Without immediate and adequate financial assistance, the Haitian Government will not be able to feed all of its people, much less satisfy the claims or keep a lid on the discontent of demobilized military personnel, who represent a genuine threat because they still have weapons and receive assistance from foreign countries.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">It is for all these reasons that our delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution extending the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti on the terms agreed to by all the Council members. We are pleased to say that this draft resolution is a product of the renewed efforts of the "Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti" within this Council and also of all the friends of Haiti outside the Security Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Somavía</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">Only a few years ago Haiti was engulfed in one of its worst crises. In an extremely short period of time in terms of the history of a country, very significant changes have occurred that have put an end to a difficult period and have allowed the Haitian people to hope once again for a better future.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">We cannot fail to congratulate Haiti's authorities and its Permanent Representative, Ambassador Lelong, on these positive developments. The United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, must feel gratified at having facilitated democratic change and stability in Haiti by establishing and maintaining one of the most successful missions in the history of peacekeeping operations. The United Nations has supported the people of Haiti, their democratic will and their political decision-making.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Problems and threats persist, however, as almost all the speakers before me have noted. That is why today we will be adopting this draft resolution, which Chile fully supports.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">At this time, we wish to thank all of those who have made this United Nations presence in Haiti possible. First of all, allow me to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General for all his efforts, as well as those of his Special Representative and of the entire civilian and military team of the United Nations Support Mission in that country. As a Latin American, I should like to recognize a distinguished Venezuelan, Enrique ter Horst, and my fellow countryman, Cristián Ossa, who just completed in Haiti a successful 25-year career as a United Nations civil servant.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">We also wish to express our gratitude to the United States for its firm support for the process of democratization in Haiti. The decisive political and financial support of Canada, France and other countries has played a crucial role in the maintenance of successive missions in the field. Last but not least, I wish to mention the understanding and support of the delegations of China and the Russian Federation, as well as of others, which have made it possible to continue the work of the United Nations in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">As we have maintained on previous occasions, the emerging reality which the Security Council faces, a result of the far-reaching political changes that occurred at the end of the 1980s, places it in the position of having to neutralize threats to international peace and security arising from problems within States and not between them. This must be handled with great care, respecting the sovereignty of States while being mindful of humanitarian needs and of the clearly expressed aspirations of national majorities.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">The Council has begun to address new situations for which it lacks tradition and experience, since its role historically has been linked to the handling of international conflicts between States. To meet these new challenges, it has become necessary to develop instruments tailored to these new needs, which are complex and difficult, in the field of international law among others. This is why we have proposed -- and we reiterate the need -- that an in-depth discussion be held within the general context of the future role of the Security Council and the United Nations in maintaining comprehensive peace and security in these new situations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">It is obvious that our region, while grateful for the support which the Council has given to a neighbouring country, is very pleased to have contributed to the restoration of peace, political stability and democratic practices in Haiti. We highly value the enormous efforts made by its two democratic Governments in conducting the process of political reconciliation and economic rehabilitation.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">The countries of Latin America are well aware of the difficulties that must be overcome to restore democracy when people are burdened by a lack of the most basic necessities. It is extremely difficult for a country to maintain support for the political values of freedom when concern over basic material needs dominates the minds of its citizens. In this situation, good governance consists not only in ensuring the legitimate establishment and exercise of authority; good governance also entails the ability to create jobs in order to guarantee people their daily bread, a roof over their heads and a dignified place in society.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">That is why we decidedly endorse the support that the United Nations must continue to provide to Haiti, even beyond the current decision. That is also why we have participated actively in negotiating the successive extensions of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) and of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) and have endorsed their maintenance. We must ensure that the many efforts to consolidate peace will pave the way for the economic and social reconstruction of the country. It would be unfortunate if the United Nations, by failing to give Haiti all the attention it requires to consolidate its progress, found itself facing a new peacekeeping operation in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa11">As has been repeatedly noted, it is essential that United Nations action continue once peace has been restored. The system must adequately respond to the need for support inherent in the phase of economic recovery and of laying the foundations for growth and sustained development.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa12">Experience in this regard has very often been discouraging. Sustained financial crises affecting United Nations agencies and programmes in the economic and social fields prevent them from providing adequate support for recovery in countries that have suffered political crises. In Latin America, Central America is a good example of this type of problem. As a result, we often find a resurgence of conflict or a perpetuation of underdevelopment, in which we encounter a paradigm in which inefficiency in the management of resources is coupled with dangerous political tensions. Indeed, resources not invested in laying the groundwork for the development of these countries are later spent in new United Nations operations, at costs considerably higher than would have been needed to consolidate the progress already made. Somalia is a case in point.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, I wish to insist on the advisability of the Council's initiating a discussion on the substantive issues which we have raised regarding new approaches to peacekeeping operations and the consolidation of achievements by giving effective support to development through the appropriate organs of the system. We believe that this is the most efficient way in which to meet the new challenges before us. We offer to the people of Haiti our respect for their democratic struggle, our solidarity in confronting those who wish to return to the past, and our friendship in cooperating for the human development of its people.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Abdel Aziz</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">The report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) is a source of general satisfaction. It provides a positive indication that the wave of violence which reached its peak last summer has subsided, and that the security situation is improving steadily due to the continued improvement of the capabilities of the Haitian police and its enhanced effectiveness in dealing with attempts to breach security and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">Such positive developments furnish practical proof of the success of UNSMIH in carrying out its mandate. They also provide further proof of its real value in supporting stable and secure conditions and in consolidating the newly born democracy and the rule of law in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Based on our solidarity with the Government and people of Haiti, we would like to enhance their ability to preserve these achievements and to give State institutions, the judicial system and the Haitian National Police an appropriate chance to reach a certain degree of development that would ensure self-sustainment and viability after the United Nations withdrawal. Since the Government of President Préval considers the continued presence of the United Nations in Haiti necessary during this period fraught with danger, the delegation of Egypt supports the reinforcement of UNSMIH's success by extending its mandate for an additional period, as noted in the draft resolution. We also support the Secretary-General's keeping the force under constant review, in the event that further reductions in the strength of the mission can be made without impairing the performance of its tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">In this connection, the delegation of Egypt would like to express its appreciation for the voluntary contributions made by Canada, the United States of America and other countries to enable the Support Mission to do its work.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">In conclusion, I would express our conviction that the optimum solution to Haiti's problems will, in the long run, be found only through social and economic development, which will bolster the efforts being made by the Government of Haiti to rebuild the country's infrastructure and achieve the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law to replace the culture of violence under which the people of Haiti had suffered for many years of its history. We therefore strongly support the draft resolution's request to all States, particularly donor States, and international financial institutions to provide the necessary technical and financial support, through bilateral and multilateral channels, for the realization of Haiti's objectives in the sphere of development. The delegation of Egypt will therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Inderfurth</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">Once again, the Security Council is acting to help the people of Haiti achieve their aspiration to live in freedom and peace. René Préval, the democratically elected President of Haiti, has called upon the Council to renew the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH). We are delighted that the Security Council will respond to that call in a positive fashion.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">UNSMIH and its predecessor have done much to help the Government of Haiti to professionalize its police and maintain the kind of secure and stable environment in which durable democratic institutions may be built. My Government commends all those who have contributed to the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, and especially the Government of Canada, which has provided outstanding leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">The result is that clear gains have been made. A new civilian police force has been established and the Palace security force is being professionalized. The Haitian economy is also beginning to improve. The Haitian Parliament has passed key privatization and civil service reforms that will spur economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a structural-adjustment programme and a $120-million credit and business leaders are increasingly optimistic.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">Even more important, the climate of democratization has made it possible for the average people of Haiti to go about their daily lives free from the fear of officially sanctioned violence. Haitians are no longer forced to choose between living in terror and trying to flee the island on leaky rafts and boats headed for American shores.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">Despite the progress, obstacles do remain. There continue to be individuals and groups within Haiti who oppose the democratic path. We hope and believe that the day is approaching when the Government of Haiti will be able to assume full responsibility for public safety, but that day has not yet arrived. The extension of UNSMIH's mandate will allow this transition to go forward, while minimizing the risk of serious setbacks or disruption.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">My Government has been heartened by the continued strong support for Haitian democracy that has been demonstrated by the Organization of American States, the United Nations and the members of the Security Council. We look forward to its being continued today. As a member of the group of "Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti" and the delegation that introduced this draft resolution, we support it strongly and hope it will be adopted unanimously by the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">We also look forward to the Secretary-General's report in March next year. We hope that report will provide the international community with guidance on how to continue contributing to the consolidation of peace and stability in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">The restoration of democracy to Haiti has been one of the most heartening developments of recent years. But there, as elsewhere, democracy remains a work in progress. Our responsibility, which we have met and I hope will continue to meet, is to help the Haitian people to secure for themselves a future marked by enduring freedom, stability and a steadily improving quality of life.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Permanent Representative of Italy.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">As the Secretary-General has reported, the security situation in Haiti and the capacity of the Haitian National Police to meet its challenges have improved somewhat. This is an encouraging development, since recent history has taught us that in Haiti there is a close connection between political stability, the Government's ability to safeguard public order, and respect for human rights. We must therefore strongly praise the efforts made by the Government of Haiti fully to restore democracy in the country. Significant results have already been achieved by the Haitian Government.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">In this regard, the Italian delegation notes with pleasure the statement by the Permanent Representative of Haiti, Ambassador Pierre Lelong, to whom I wish to express my appreciation for his valuable contribution to our deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">We must also be grateful to Canada and the United States for their meaningful contributions to restoring peace and promoting reconciliation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">The role played by the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) in the phase of democratic transition was of course also of crucial importance. The democratically elected President, René Préval, has been able to count on the presence of the international force to guarantee public order and start the training of the Haitian National Police, which will have to handle internal security on its own when UNSMIH is withdrawn. Italy fully supports the extension of the mandate for six months and the provision for the possibility of an additional two-month extension to be subsequently decided by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">In this delicate phase of consolidation of the democratic process and system, there are still threats to political stability. It is to strengthen the results thus far achieved through the commitment of the international community that the Security Council approves the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission. By 31 March, the Council will carefully consider the nature of a subsequent international presence in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">The international community should facilitate the strategic relationship that Haiti must establish with international financial institutions, whose support is indispensable to the economic rehabilitation of the country. A better standard of living is fundamental to consolidating democracy and respect for human rights in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">I now put to the vote the draft resolution in <a href="../pdf/S-1996-1002.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/1002</a>.</p>
