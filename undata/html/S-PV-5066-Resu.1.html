</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">I now give the floor to Ms. Agathe Rwankuba of the Réseau des femmes pour la défense des droits et la paix.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Rwankuba</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">My  name  is Agathe Rwankuba. I am a lawyer at the Bukavu Court of Appeals and a member of the non-governmental organization Réseau des femmes pour la défense des droits et la paix, based in Bukavu, in the province of South Kivu, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">First, I extend my sincere thanks to the Government of the United Kingdom, the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, and International Alert for giving me the opportunity to participate in this meeting on behalf of the women of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">In my statement today, I shall make three specific recommendations to help the Council in its efforts to eradicate sexual violence against women. We all are aware of the extent of gender-based violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For example, in the eastern part of the country, we believe that at least 35,000 women and girls have been raped since the beginning of the war in 1996. Given the extent and the devastating consequences of gender-specific violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and many other conflict areas throughout the world, I would like to thank the Security Council and the United Kingdom during its presidency for devoting today's meeting to this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa04">My first recommendation is that financing allocated to the Human Rights Section and the Gender Section of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) should be enhanced in order to establish a genuine partnership with local women's organizations. The fact that the Security Council, by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1565(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1565 (2004)</a>, has enlarged MONUC's mandate is positive. Since December 2002, MONUC's Human Rights Section has been working in the province of South Kivu with local women's organizations, including my own, in order to identify and rehabilitate the victims of violence, according to their rights. The organizations support the women living in the most remote rural regions, to which MONUC has no access due to lack of sufficient resources. MONUC's Gender Section is based in Kinshasa, which is 2,000 kilometres from South Kivu. My organization has never had the opportunity to meet a staff member of the Gender Section. It is clear that the Gender Section should have greater support in order to form an effective partnership with women's organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa05">Secondly, I endorse the recommendation of the Secretary-General that states that the Security Council, Member States, the United Nations and other international organizations should "Apply increased pressure on parties to armed conflict ... to cease all violations of the human rights of women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2004-814.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/814</a>, para. 87</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa06">Although the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has officially ended, some local and foreign militias continue to sow terror and commit sexual violence in the eastern part of the country. The fact that the Security Council has decided to strengthen the number of Blue Helmets in my country has given rise to enormous hope among the local population, especially the women with whom I work every day. We must earnestly hope that those peacekeeping forces will help strengthen security in the Democratic Republic of Congo, restore peace in our region and prevent other crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa07">However, given the great extent of our national territory, the number of Blue Helmets continues to be clearly insufficient. That is why I urge the Security Council to further strengthen their number and presence in the east of the country as soon as possible, to help the country to work in consultation with its neighbours to disarm and repatriate foreign militias, and to apply pressure on countries that still have armed groups in our country to repatriate them.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa08">Another particularly alarming problem in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is that some armed groups continue to hold girl soldiers as sex slaves, thereby excluding them from the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) process. It is imperative that those girls be included in the MONUC programmes. Therefore I urge the Security Council to provide the Gender Section and the Human Rights Section of MONUC with the necessary human and financial resources in order to collect information on those girl soldiers and ensure that they are demobilized.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa09">Finally, I recommend that the Security Council, in accordance with paragraph 87 of the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security, act immediately to put an end to impunity by means of the following measures. First, there should be an independent international enquiry to identify in a precise manner those responsible, individually and collectively, for sexual violence against women during the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Secondly, the Human Rights Section and the Gender Section of MONUC should be requested to work with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, to harmonize national legislation with international standards.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa10">The women of South Kivu have mobilized to combat sexual violence and fight for the vindication of the rights of the victims. The Coalition Against Gender Violence, of which my organization is a founding member, has made proposals to reform national criminal law to redefine and strengthen criminal laws against rape. However, those proposals have gone unheeded.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa11">Although rape and sexual abuse spare no age group, they particularly affect the active female population in agricultural areas, which is the main productive force and essential pillar in any subsistence economy of the region. The physical and moral damage suffered by those women has considerably reduced their productivity, thereby exacerbating the poverty of rural communities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa12">In that context, it is important for the international community to provide funds for women's groups in rural communities, work in close cooperation with those groups and take into consideration their point of view in the reconstruction process, as the Secretary-General recommends in paragraph 88 of his report. The necessary resources should be provided for programmes that provide care and support to victims of sexual violence. In particular, all female victims should have access to medical assistance in order to treat medical problems resulting from rape and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa13">In conclusion, I express my thanks for the praiseworthy efforts that have been made so far by the Security Council to bring peace and security to the women of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, I ask the Council to accept the following three recommendations to better protect women, prevent renewed violence and encourage the participation of women.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa14">First, funding has to be increased for the Gender Section and Human Rights Section of MONUC so that they can work in partnership with women's organizations and assist victims of sexual violence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa15">Secondly, peacekeeping forces in the country need to be strengthened, and the Gender Section and Human Rights Section of MONUC must receive human and financial resources so that they can collect information enabling them to identify girl soldiers and ensure that they are included in DDR programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa16">Thirdly, we must act immediately to put an end to impunity by urging the Gender Section and the Human Rights Section of MONUC to advocate legislative reform in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and by establishing an independent international commission of inquiry on sexual violence committed during the war in the country.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">Before I turn to the next speaker, could I just remind all potential speakers that the Council asked me at the start of the debate -- and let me repeat it now -- to try to encourage interventions to be no more than five minutes. Cooperation in that regard would be very much appreciated.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">I now give the floor to the Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, Ms. Noeleen Heyzer.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Heyzer</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01"> I thank you, Sir, for the honour of addressing the Council on the important issue of women, peace and security, focusing on gender-based violence.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">In times of conflict, violence against women becomes more than personal devastation; it becomes -- as we have seen all too painfully in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Bosnia and today in Darfur -- a means for the wholesale destruction of communities and peoples. The international community is now fully aware that rape and other forms of violence against women are systematically used as a weapon of war. And in many wars and conflicts, rape has been used as a way of humiliating the men of the other side, infecting women with HIV/AIDS, forcing them into sexual slavery and destroying women's ability to revitalize their communities.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">What ultimately must we do to achieve justice and accountability for victims of gender-based violence? Impunity for gender crimes continues to prevail in post-conflict societies and will likely never be completely eliminated, given the shortcomings of international and national justice in dealing with sexual crimes. However, justice and accountability are critical to the healing and peace process. As we work towards ending impunity, it is important to ensure that those responsible for crimes against women are not rewarded with State power and high-profile jobs as a result of negotiated peace agreements. It is important to include women at the peace table and in the process of reconstruction. It is important to address the nature and root causes of violence against women.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">Within the human rights framework, violence against women is recognized as a manifestation of deeply-rooted historical patterns of discrimination against women and of systemic gender inequalities. Seen in its true light, gender-based violence in times of conflict is part of the continuum of violence that runs through women's lives, from times of peace to times of war. It only deepens with war. In all cases, its origins lie in inequality. Gender inequality is, in fact, a seed that, in times of conflict, bears the bitter fruit of systematic campaigns to destroy the lives of women, families and communities.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The good news is that we now know so much about effective measures to eliminate violence against women. Great strides have been made in setting norms, standards and legal frameworks, and the challenge now is to ensure the implementation of the very good laws that many countries have already developed, working closely with and providing the necessary support for national players. Mechanisms for enforcing rights and redressing violations are critical to accountability and justice.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">Legal reforms must be accompanied by the training and reform of the criminal justice system, which is not very sensitive to the needs of women victims. Some of the changes that have been made to the administration of justice -- through the creation of specialized police stations, the training of police forces as a whole and partnerships with women's groups -- must be instituted as broadly as possible. Coordinated community-level interventions must bring together men, local Government, traditional leaders, medical and legal professionals, and the leaders of women's organizations so that the framework of international and national laws can be firmly connected to women's lived realities.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">We also know that violence must be dealt with at multiple levels and in multiple sectors of society simultaneously, and that the root causes of violence must be addressed, including women's poor economic, social and political status. Through the United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women, administered by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), initiatives have been taken in all of those areas. Those initiatives hold the key to lives free of violence for all women, but they need to be scaled up and adequately resourced to become standard practice in crisis and post-crisis situations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">At the end of the day, the root causes of violence must be addressed by enforcing women's rights and eliminating all forms of discrimination against women. Gender justice requires the integration of gender perspectives within every dimension of justice and the participation of women in shaping justice frameworks and rule of law institutions in ways that promote their human rights, legal equality and inclusion. It requires legal justice to address discriminatory laws against women, such as inheritance laws which prevent women from owning property. It requires justice to address violations of human rights and war crimes so that women can move beyond their trauma and begin to construct new lives for themselves. It requires economic and social justice to address political, economic and social inequalities that frequently underlie violence and conflict. Women have been the victims of war; women must now be part of the solutions for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">In our work on gender justice, we have been supporting all of those dimensions. For example, in Afghanistan we have supported gender and rights training, the involvement of women in the drafting of laws and their participation in elections. In Rwanda, our support for women leaders has helped to promote their role in Government and today the country has the highest percentage worldwide of women judges and women in Parliament. Our support has also led to the passage of the inheritance bill, which guarantees women and girls the right to inherit property, and will go a long way in helping the agricultural sector. In the Great Lakes region, we assisted the office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General as well as women's organizations in preparing for the Great Lakes Regional Women's Meeting. The calls issued at that Meeting must now be seriously attended to at the meeting of heads of State and Government of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">We must never allow the opportunity that post-conflict reconstruction presents for establishing the rule of law to be overlooked. The real cure for violence against women lies in constitutions with strong and clear guarantees of gender equality. It is to be found in legal reforms that ensure equality in marriage and family relations, in the ownership of property and in equal access to secure employment. It depends on women being supported to participate in elections as voters and in ensuring their rightful representation in Government.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">With those fundamental building blocks in place, not only will all women be assured of redress for violence, but the prospect of reducing and eventually eliminating gender-based violence finally comes into view. The wholesale damage to lives and communities that is inflicted by the kind of violence that we have seen can never be undone, so our sights must be set not only on redress in the immediate sense, but also on the essential concern of cutting violence off at its roots.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">We are at a historical crossroads where the opportunity now exists to make the rule of law and the perspective of women central to peace processes. As noted in the Secretary-General's report, much has been achieved since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, but much remains to be done. I would like to draw the Council's attention to three areas in particular that were recently highlighted at the Conference on Gender Justice in Post-Conflict Situations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">First, the participation of women and the incorporation of gender dimensions must be increased in all stages of the conceptualization, planning and implementation of United Nations peace operations. Peace operations should have adequate numbers of gender-justice specialist staff in all offices and should seriously draw on the specialized gender expertise available from the United Nations funds and programmes operating on the ground, including UNIFEM. United Nations bodies must also collaborate more closely and more frequently on gender justice objectives with local, professional and academic groups engaged in training women judges and lawyers, and with networks of women and men to help change attitudes and ensure the full participation of women in the post-crisis phase.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa14">Secondly, United Nations peacekeeping personnel have a special obligation not to violate the trust that women and girls place in them. Unfortunately, serious misconduct has been identified. Gender justice must be extended to our international guardians. Means must be developed to ensure the responsibility and accountability of United Nations peacekeeping personnel, who serve as role models to the local communities, for proper behaviour towards women. Comprehensive policies and procedures must be established to prevent and punish trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse. We have to keep our own house in order if we expect others to do the same.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa15">Thirdly, gender justice must be a priority within the United Nations system, including United Nations peace operations, and institutional arrangements must be strengthened to accelerate progress. We still lack the adequate organizational structures, staffing, resources and coordination needed to achieve gender justice. For post-crisis situations, the United Nations should have a central mechanism to focus on coordinated assistance for gender justice. Together with the United Nations Development Programme and the International Legal Assistance Consortium, UNIFEM will be following up on some of the recommendations of the Gender Justice Conference, including through the Partners for Gender Justice Initiative. However, further steps will require the involvement of the United Nations system as a whole, as well as Member States, regional organizations and civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa16">Gender justice will not be achieved unless we address the current institutional deficit within the United Nations regarding gender. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> is a good example of how women have been able to bring issues of protection and their role in peacekeeping to the attention of the Security Council. What is needed now is a serious strategy and comprehensive implementation through a stronger and more coherent gender architecture within the United Nations system and through partnerships with local organizations that address current challenges and promote strategies that have worked.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa17">It has taken more than two decades for women's voices to be seriously heard, a decade to establish the norms and legal frameworks for gender justice needed to eliminate violence against women and to empower women economically and politically. Women from war-torn societies across the world are now waiting for us to fully address the recommendations of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> in ways that can make real differences in their everyday lives. We cannot allow another decade to pass before that happens.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kim Sam-hoon</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The report of the Secretary-General makes it clear that, while significant progress has been made in several key areas in the past two years, there still remain vast gaps between the goals of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and its implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">My delegation appreciates the advances made in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> in the area of peacekeeping. We are pleased to note that there are now full-time gender specialists in 10 of the 17 United Nations peacekeeping operations, supported and guided by the Gender Adviser at Headquarters in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">We also commend the efforts that have been made by United Nations entities, Member States and civil society in training military, civilian police and civilian peacekeeping personnel on the protection of the rights and needs of women. But we underscore the Secretary-General's call for a more coherent strategy for strengthening understanding among all actors of the relevance of gender issues to peacekeeping. We also strongly support the development and implementation of recruitment strategies to increase women's participation in military, civilian police and peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">My delegation fully subscribes to the view that post-conflict processes can offer societies emerging from conflict a new chance to recast social relations for the better. We therefore welcome the Secretary-General's finding that women's participation in post-conflict reconstruction has increased in recent years. We are particularly pleased to note the significant progress has been made in Afghanistan, where women were very much involved in the formulation of a new national constitution. Furthermore, we are heartened by the fact that 20 per cent of the seats in that country's new constitutional body are held by women. That dynamic is also in evidence in Rwanda, where constitutional set-asides and new elections have brought 49 per cent of the seats to women in the lower Parliament, which represents the highest proportion of women in parliaments worldwide.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">However, we remain concerned that the majority of reconstruction efforts do not systematically include gender perspectives. Accordingly, we support the Secretary-General's call for systematic incorporation of gender perspectives in the planning, implementation and monitoring of all reconstruction programmes and budgets.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">One of the terrible truths of modern warfare is that women and girls suffer at a level wholly disproportionate to their involvement in a given conflict. In particular, gender-based violence -- including rape, sexual slavery and other forms of abuse -- has been a shameful aspect of warfare in many conflicts around the world. The consequences have been tragic for millions of women and girls, as well as for the families, communities and societies they sustain.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">We are troubled that the international community has not yet been able to prevent acts of violence against women during armed conflict. As the Secretary-General's report notes, sexual and gender-based violence have recently been reported in the Darfur region of the Sudan and in other countries in conflict or post-conflict situations. Clearly, we have a long way to go in eliminating that scourge upon humanity.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">Nevertheless, we have hope in the positive developments in our uphill battle against gender-based violence. The special rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights, in particular the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, have played an important role in drawing attention to the vulnerability of women in recent conflicts. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda have broken new ground in the area of jurisprudence on sexual violence under international law. Most significantly, the establishment of the International Criminal Court, with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity -- including rape, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence -- promises to eliminate impunity for gender-based crimes against women in armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">That hope, however, will not automatically become reality. Member States must send strong signals to parties to armed conflicts that violations of women's human rights and gender-based violence will be met with severe punishment and sanctions. We must vigorously pursue and prosecute those who commit such criminal acts, and we must enhance the effectiveness of tribunals and justice mechanisms. The best way to prevent gender-based violence during wartime is to send a clear signal to would-be perpetrators that their crimes will not go unpunished. Furthermore, for countries emerging from conflict, the elaboration of a domestic legal system that provides effective ways to bring the perpetrators of gender-based crimes to justice would be important in the post-conflict peace-building process.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">It has been four years since <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> was adopted. However, lack of protection for women and girls and violations of their human rights during armed conflict still persist. The Republic of Korea reaffirms its commitment to working bilaterally, multilaterally and through United Nations agencies to do our share for the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Gallardo Hernández</span> <span class="nation">El Salvador</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Allow me to express my Government's satisfaction about the fact that the Security Council has continued to address this important issue. I would also like to thank you, Mr. President, for your initiative to convene this open debate, on the fourth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2004).pdf" class="nolink">resolution 1325 (2004)</a>, on the subject of women and peace and security. This is an exceedingly important subject, as it leads us to take up critical areas of the Beijing Platform for Action dealing with women and armed conflict. It also leads us to address efforts aimed at the maintenance of international peace and security, which is the primary role of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The Government of El Salvador would like to reiterate its concern about the fact that civilians -- and especially women, children and older persons -- continue to suffer from the devastating consequences of armed conflict, including as refugees and internally displaced persons. As we all know, that has a grave impact on lasting peace and reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The experience of the people of El Salvador with armed conflict during more than a decade enables us today to be able to pass on some lessons learned associated with the subject under discussion. Among those lessons, we wish to point out that women are a basic pillar in maintaining family cohesion, struggling for daily existence, keeping a clear focus on their children's priority needs, passing on values and life experiences and becoming the person who establishes spaces for dialogue and agreement, thereby making her the one who can most accurately identify possible areas of intolerance.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The Government of El Salvador would like to emphasize that it is important and necessary for women to participate comprehensively and on an equal footing in all initiatives designed to maintain and promote peace and security, as well as in United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building efforts. It is therefore essential that we promote and strengthen women's participation in the decision-making processes associated with the prevention and resolution of conflict. Similarly, we believe it essential for women to have access to information channels in order that they may be able to identify potential sources of violence, open up new spaces for dialogue among society and instil the values of tolerance and peace, which are essential if peace is to last.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">My delegation would like to point out that, for peace to be genuine, women must be able to benefit from peace dividends. In our opinion, this is one of the most important lessons we have learned, because women are capable of looking beyond their individual interests to focus on priorities that strengthen the family and its surroundings, very often at the expense of their own needs.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The Government of El Salvador supports the initiatives designed to incorporate a gender perspective in peacekeeping operations. For this reason, we welcome the decision of the Security Council, set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, to give all peacekeeping personnel specialized training in the area of protection, special needs and the human rights of women, children and the elderly in conflict situations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">In this regard, we urge the Security Council to draw on the accumulated experience and specialized expertise in gender issues of the relevant institutions of the United Nations. In particular, we would like to refer here to the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, as well as the successful experiences of each and every Member State.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">At the same time, we urge the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to broaden the role and contributions of women to United Nations operations, both on the ground and at Headquarters. This would apply in particular to military observers, civilian police and personnel working on the promotion and protection of human rights and humanitarian tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, allow me once again to state that the Government of El Salvador is ready to continue supporting all the initiatives and measures taken by the Security Council to promote a gender perspective and the advancement of women. It is also willing to contribute to actions designed to protect and promote the rights of women in conflict situations, giving them scope to participate in the long-term process of reconciliation -- the only thing that can guarantee a new form of coexistence within countries.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wenaweser</span> <span class="nation">Liechtenstein</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">The need to fully involve women in all efforts in the area of peace and security was recognized in the Beijing Platform for Action. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> provides the necessary momentum and concrete recommendations for implementation in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">The Secretary-General's first report in response to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> again placed strong emphasis on the need for women to be actively involved in all decision-making processes relating to armed conflict. There is ample evidence that effective peacemaking, peacekeeping, peace-building and post-conflict reconstruction, as well as the delivery of humanitarian assistance, greatly benefit from the active participation of women. Shifting the perception of women as victims to women as participants is, therefore, at the core of change in the issue before us today.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">However, and in spite of important advances, women continue to be both disproportionately affected by armed conflicts and disproportionately uninvolved in decisions related to them. In the key area of participation, progress is still very slow. We continue to believe that the United Nations itself can and should lead by example in order to galvanize this process and that the posts of Special Envoys and Special Representatives, as well as other senior operational positions, are of crucial importance in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> has been widely disseminated and is known to a large constituency. Nevertheless, we are certainly still far behind the goals that we had set for ourselves in that resolution. Our annual debate must be an exercise of stock-taking and of identifying the areas where action is most urgently needed. The practical work on implementation must be carried out throughout the year, on a consistent and regular basis. It seems, therefore, important to establish mechanisms of mainstreaming <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> into the daily work of the Council. The proposal made by the European Union to designate a focal point for that purpose seems to us a very valuable contribution in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">In the area of criminal prosecution of gender-based violence, very significant progress has been made. The ad hoc Tribunals have made historic contributions to international jurisprudence, in particular through the Akayesu case before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and increased awareness around the globe that sexual violence will not go unpunished.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its supplemental documents criminalize gender-based and sexual violence committed as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Applying the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute in individual cases before the Court is instrumental not only in providing redress to victims but also in advancing the law at the international level. Perhaps even more importantly, the entry into force of the Rome Statute and the commencement of operations of the ICC provide the legal and political incentive for States to include definitions of these crimes in domestic legislation and to apply them in their courts.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">In spite of all these important developments, there is still the risk that gender-based and sexual violence is neglected in proceedings before Courts, not least because they often involve considerable difficulties and sensitivities. It is, therefore, important to reinforce the message that sexual violence will not go unpunished, in particular because those forms of violence are some of the most commonly used and, sadly, most effective ways of terrorizing entire communities and populations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">In order to prevent gender-based violence in armed conflict, the vigorous promotion and protection of human rights of women and girls must hold centre stage. Report after report, including the one before us today, have made it clear that the effects of armed conflict on women are particularly grave where a culture of violence and discrimination against them existed prior to an armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">The gender-based early warning indicators in conflict prevention, such as gender-specific migration and rising violence against women, may indeed alert us to horrors to come in armed conflict. But they also reflect deep-seated forms of discrimination against women; indeed, they are indicators of the level of discrimination against them. To effectively prevent or fight the excesses of gender-based violence in armed conflict, discrimination and violence must also be addressed at a much earlier stage.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">United Nations action in this area can be effective only if we keep our own house in order. Gender-based violence in United Nations-led operations -- in particular in peacekeeping, where the population concerned is likely to be particularly vulnerable -- should never occur and must never be condoned. We welcome the ongoing efforts aimed at preventing such acts, which do great damage to the goals set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hannesson</span> <span class="nation">Iceland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Iceland, as a member of the European Economic Area, aligns itself with the statement made earlier by my colleague from the Netherlands on behalf of the European Union, but in addition I would like to make a few remarks.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">My delegation welcomes this opportunity as a non-Council member to address the Security Council on the subject of women, peace and security, in an open meeting, on the fourth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">At the outset, my Government would like to express its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his report on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2004-814.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2004/814</a>. That resolution has proven to be an important milestone for the direct involvement of women in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace-building. It is now finally acknowledged that women have an important role to play in the establishment and maintenance of peace and security in conflict regions.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">The implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> requires the same strong efforts as that of any other Security Council resolution. Since the adoption of the resolution, United Nations Member States and other entities have taken important steps to implement it. The report points out that, nonetheless, major gaps and challenges still remain in all areas, including in particular in relation to women's participation in conflict prevention and peace processes. The international community must continue its work, with full resolve and commitment on the part of all stakeholders, and make it a top priority fully to implement the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">It is true that armed conflict has a severe impact and widespread repercussions on people and societies in general. Women and girls become especially vulnerable as the infrastructure disintegrates during the period of conflict and the security network within their society breaks down. Under such circumstances, the protection of women and girls against gender-based violence is of the utmost importance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">It is regrettable, to say the least, that the international community has thus far not been able to prevent acts of violence against women from occurring during armed conflict, and that we are still today receiving stark and disturbing evidence of gender-based violence in countries such as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Sudan. Our only option is to aim to prevent gender-based violence and to make the strongest possible efforts to pursue our goals in that regard. Early-warning mechanisms have a crucial role to play in responding to gender-based violence and to prevent it from reoccurring. Such monitoring efforts must be complemented by practical measures to end impunity and to bring those who are responsible to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">My Government concurs with the findings of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the important role that the international tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia have played in the jurisprudence on sexual violence under international law. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court recognizes the specific impact of armed conflict on women by criminalizing gender-based violence. Even though the international community has set up these mechanisms to react to the horrific repercussions of armed conflict, the responsibility of those States where armed conflict occurs cannot be avoided; they bear primary responsibility for bringing perpetrators to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">My Government is deeply disturbed by reports of alleged sexual exploitation and sexual abuse committed by United Nations personnel, and we agree with the Secretary-General that such behaviour is absolutely unacceptable. The United Nations and its Member States must do their utmost to root out any signs of such violence.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">Finally, I would like to make mention of the support the Icelandic Government has given to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. Since 2000 the Icelandic Government has had a gender expert working at the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) office in Kosovo, and this summer it extended her term until February 2005. UNIFEM in Kosovo has been playing an important role in advancing gender equality by assisting local women in developing an action plan for gender equality in Kosovo and by providing various courses for municipalities and professionals to enhance gender equality. Furthermore, the Icelandic Government supported UNIFEM's National Committee in Iceland in the organization of a conference on women, war and security, with Elisabeth Rehn, former Minister for Defence of Finland, as keynote speaker, and by financing a report on gender mainstreaming in the Iceland Crisis Response Unit -- the Icelandic Peacekeeping Unit.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Can I offer colleagues two simple facts: we have 17 or 18 speakers, and we are averaging, so far, eight and a half minutes per intervention. I did ask that, at the Council's request, we try to keep it to five. That is a degree of inflation we could do without, so can I encourage those who are lining up to try and shorten their statements, especially if there is a prepared text.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Mali, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diarra</span> <span class="nation">Mali</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">The delegation of the Republic of Mali associates itself with the statement made by Canada on behalf of the member countries of the Human Security Network.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">The measures adopted four years ago in this body with respect to the relationship between women and peace and security are part and parcel of a more comprehensive approach whose ultimate goal is to give women their rightful place in our societies. This approach involves equal treatment for women in terms of rights and responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">The experience of the past decade has shown that, in conflict situations, women and young girls are the principal victims of abduction and of gender-based violence, in particular rape and other forms of violence. Sometimes they take an active part in conflicts -- as armed-group sympathizers, combatants, companions of combatants or as individuals dependent on combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The criminal practice of the forced recruitment of women remains widespread despite the existence of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which has become almost universal since its adoption in 1979.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">It was in order to prevent the use of such practices, which are often used as a weapon of war, that the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. Since then its contents have been translated into 60 languages -- a clear demonstration of the importance of the subject and the interest it has generated. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> has been implemented by Member States, the United Nations system and regional organizations such as the African Union, as well as by civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">Its implementation involves, first and foremost, the conflict prevention and early warning. Here the goal is to strengthen the capacity and the role of women in the context of the decision-making process in order to prevent conflicts. To that end, reliable indicators such as a database on women experts are gradually being set up.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">The implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> also concerns the gender-based management of conflict situations. In that respect, initiatives aimed at settling crises should address the particular needs of women in the peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and post-conflict reconstruction phases. Women should be actively involved in determining those needs. Women's associations and groups could also contribute to that process.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">The outcome of the Conference on Gender Justice in Post-Conflict Situations, organized jointly by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the International Legal Assistance Consortium and held in September 2004, has yielded new ideas as to what steps might be undertaken.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">That approach commits States, the United Nations, regional organizations and civil society to draw up strategies and plans of action, with a timetable, to see to it that the question of gender parity is an integral part of peacekeeping operations, humanitarian operations and peace-building in countries in post-conflict situations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">My delegation is pleased that such measures are gradually being established within United Nations peacekeeping operations. We appreciate the fact that 10 full-time gender advisers have already been appointed in 17 peacekeeping operations. We welcome the systematic participation of human rights specialists in new peacekeeping operations whose role is to monitor and identify cases of gender-based violence.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">My delegation welcomes the inclusion of training programmes on the gender-specific management of issues related to peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, my delegation hopes that the Secretary-General's bulletin on the implementation of the resolution within the United Nations system will lead to a genuine revolution in thought and in deed. Finally, the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court, strengthens the international legal arsenal, punishing rape and other forms of gender-based violence as war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa12">A movement is emerging in the African Union (AU) to advance and protect the rights of women. Indeed, in July 2003, by its decision 19 the Union adopted the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. In that framework, a campaign was launched throughout the continent to combat violence against women. Moreover, with the establishment of the Women, Gender and Development Directorate, the AU is attempting to elaborate an effective strategy to integrate a gender perspective in the activities of the Commission of the African Union, as well as in those of its member States. A framework for implementation and coordination will be adopted and indicators to identify, supervise and evaluate progress will also be established. The ultimate goal is to promote the emancipation of African women by ensuring their participation on an equal footing, without restrictions, in development and other processes that elaborate and define their work and living conditions. As proof of its commitment, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union elected five women to the post of Commissioner out of the total of 10 posts that make up the Union's Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa13">In conclusion, Africa will better succeed in protecting women and young girls by strengthening the legal arsenal against gender-based violence and by ensuring their economic independence through capacity-building in that area. We must gradually involve women in the decision-making processes that affect their living conditions by fostering access to quality education for young girls. Finally, best practices in combating social prejudice against women should be increased.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Japan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ozawa</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Thank you very much Mr. President for providing us with an opportunity to make a few comments on a subject to which we attach great importance -- strengthening the United Nations response to gender-based violence in conflict and post-conflict situations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">The manner in which women are often obliged to live during armed conflict is indeed a moral outrage. They are usually neither the initiators of conflict nor the wagers of war, and yet their gender is often specifically targeted. That situation should in no way be tolerated. However, we also need to be sober enough to recognize that the international community can do much more to address the problem in post-conflict situations rather than during the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">The post-conflict situation opens up real opportunities to remove threats to women's dignity. Moreover, Japan is convinced that empowering women is one of the most effective means for peace-building in post conflict situations. Successful peace-building will lead to the prevention of the recurrence of conflict, thus reducing the risk of gender-based violence spreading again. As <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> reaffirmed, women themselves have an important role to play in the prevention of conflict, as they are known to play critical roles in building the capacity of communities to prevent new or recurrent violence.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">The recognition that women play important roles in peace-building is now widely shared. What we must do is to follow up that recognition with action on the ground to empower women in post-conflict situations. Women need assistance in order for them to play larger roles in their communities and to be integrated into the mainstream peace-building and reconstruction processes.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">In that regard, my delegation wishes again to refer to the concept of human security, which we believe is, in essence, the protection and empowerment of ordinary individuals. The promotion of human security is now one of the major pillars of Japan's foreign policy. In order to ensure that more actions are taken in the field to enhance human security, Japan took the initiative to establish the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security. Allow me to cite a few examples where United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies are utilizing that Fund for the purpose of empowering women in post-conflict situations. The United Nations Population Fund is conducting an approximately $1 million project on emergency reproductive health services in Eritrea. The United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) is administering an approximately $1 million project to promote reintegration of internally displaced persons and refugee women in community building in Afghanistan. In Rwanda, UNIFEM is conducting a $1.3 million project on enhancing human security through gender equality in the context of HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">In the four years since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, there has been a positive shift in international understanding of the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, as well as of the importance of their participation in all areas related to peace and security. Owing to the resolution, the importance of partnership between men and women in the peace-building and reconstruction process now enjoys wider recognition, and, indeed, the international community has made significant strides in implementing the resolution. As the Secretary-General's report notes, however, the real test of the adequacy of those efforts is measured by their impact on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">Japan is committed to working actively in this area, and building on the lessons learned, so that we are more effective in bringing about more real changes on the ground.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of the United Republic of Tanzania.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Kafanabo</span> <span class="nation">Tanzania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">My delegation is pleased to participate in this open debate to mark the fourth anniversary of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women, peace and security. Allow me at the outset to thank the presenters for sharing with us information, as well as their views and experiences on the implementation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">This landmark resolution has provided a mechanism for the protection of the rights of women in conflict situations, as well as ensuring their participation at all stages and levels of peace processes. As we celebrate the fourth year since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, we need to ensure the sustainability of the achievements registered so far and to put more effort into addressing the challenges we have encountered or are expecting to encounter as we advance further in its implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">In that regard, we welcome the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security. The report contains insightful information and provides recommendations that should be taken seriously by all Member States. We also welcome the report of the United Nations Development Fund for Women entitled, "Getting It Right, Doing It Right: Gender and Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration", which includes case studies from the field providing more insights into the situation at hand.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">We note with concern that, although significant achievements have been recorded in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, there are still major gaps and challenges in all areas. The failure to provide adequate protection to women during conflict, as well as in peacekeeping situations, is a matter of serious concern and merits our concerted efforts to address the situation. We thus urge the close cooperation of the United Nations system and other regional organizations. In the case of Africa, collaboration with the Africa Union and its new organs is necessary. It should be noted, however, that collaboration with regional organizations will require the capacity-building of those organizations in terms of technical, human and financial resources.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">Implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> will also require raising the awareness of the conflicting factions and all the players involved in peace processes to enable them to understand the provisions of the text and thus to build consensus on its implementation requirements. Here we also need to build the capacity of local communities, including women's groups, to explain the terms of the resolution in order for them to advocate on its behalf.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">One challenge before us is how to achieve the effective participation of women at all levels and stages of peace processes. We urge that the role of women in these processes should be built into peace agreements from the very beginning and urge Member States to increase the number of women participating in police forces and the military and to increase the number of women in civilian decision-making positions. In this regard, we applaud the Secretary-General's efforts to increase the number of women and to mainstream gender in peacekeeping operations and we request continued efforts in that area.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">We would like to echo the observation of UNIFEM that without women's equal participation and full involvement in peace-building, neither justice nor development will be possible in a war-torn society's transition to peace.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">In recognition of women's participation, the Great Lakes peace process has provided women with a space in which to discuss their contributions, first through national meetings in which a large number of national stakeholders were involved and later at a regional meeting. The recently concluded regional meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, has produced a declaration that will be read to the heads of State when they convene their meeting in Tanzania in November. We wish to commend UNIFEM's role in facilitating the meetings in this endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">When we discuss women, peace and security, we cannot leave out the impact of HIV/AIDS on women in conflict situations and in peacekeeping processes. The disease is claiming the larger part of the productive sector of our population. This will have adverse effects on the growth and stability of African economies and society. HIV/AIDS has impacted conflict situations and peacekeeping. It has been documented that HIV infection rates are higher in African armies than in the rest of the society. Women are therefore vulnerable to infection through acts of sexual and gender violence perpetuated against them by the enemy armies, the national armies and some unethical peacekeepers.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">HIV/AIDS may also affect peacekeeping efforts, as armies may not be able to deploy whole contingents to peacekeeping missions, thus depriving women of the required protection. The peacekeepers are also prone to spreading AIDS in areas where they are deployed and when they return to their home countries. They are also apt to be infected by the local population. In all of those situations, women bear the brunt of the consequences. It is thus necessary to ensure that peacekeeping efforts also take into consideration the fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Finally, allow me to reaffirm the commitment of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this important meeting to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, a resolution that has drawn the international community's attention to the crucial role of women in conflict prevention and conflict resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">My delegation commends the efforts of the Secretary-General and the United Nations entities to broadly disseminate <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We particularly welcome the initiative taken by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs by establishing a task force on conflict prevention, peace-building and development to elaborate a working plan that will look into the underlying causes of conflicts, such as poverty, socio-economic and gender inequalities and endemic underdevelopment. It is necessary to understand the root causes of conflicts and the dynamics that perpetuate them so that they can be seriously addressed in efforts to prevent or end conflicts. We also applaud all the important work that the United Nations Development Fund for Women has been doing in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> calls on all actors to ensure the full participation of women in peace processes and to adopt gender perspectives when negotiating peace agreements. My delegation could not agree more. Peace is not everything, but without peace, everything can become nothing, and nowhere can this phrase be better understood than in this Council, which has the primary duty of maintaining international peace and security. The efforts of the Security Council have brought peace and security to millions, and yet there are still many places in the world besieged by conflict, despite the Council's best efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">It takes many factors to bring about peace and stability. We know this only too well. My country, after experiencing many decades of internal strife, has in the past decade been able to achieve peace and stability. Myanmar had to face armed insurgency barely a few months after regaining its independence in 1948. Until recently, there were 18 major insurgent groups, but because of the national reconciliation efforts of the Government, 17 of them have now returned to the legal fold. The only remaining group is the Karen National Union. The Government and the Karen National Union have already been able to reach a ceasefire arrangement. Peace and stability now prevail.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">We fully share the Secretary-General's view that gender-based violence is entirely unacceptable and must be effectively addressed. In this regard, two delegations have made politically motivated and unsubstantiated allegations against Myanmar regarding gender-based violence. The Secretary-General's report dealt comprehensively with gender-based violence and listed a number of countries in which it occurs. My country was certainly not among them.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">The most effective means to protect civilians -- particularly those who are most vulnerable, women and children -- is to end conflict through peaceful solutions. At present, my country has embarked on an historical path by convening a national convention that brings together delegates from all strata of society and representatives from 17 major armed ethnic groups. Many women delegates are taking part in this historic process, which will bring about lasting peace, stability, development and democracy for all peoples of Myanmar, both women and men.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">The Secretary-General has rightly maintained that the goals set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> require political will and concerted action on the part of the entire international community. My delegation fully subscribes to that view. For our part, we will join hands with others so that the promise held out to women across the globe that their rights will be protected will be fully realized.</p>

	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Namibia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Andjaba</span> <span class="nation">Namibia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">I wish to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for convening this open debate on women and peace and security. Allow me to also thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-814.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/814</a>) on the same subject.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">As indicated in that report, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> builds on the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly and the work of the Security Council. It calls for women's equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. The resolution also reaffirms the need to fully implement international humanitarian and human rights law to protect women and girls from human rights abuses, including and especially gender-based violence. It is appalling, however, to note that instances of such violence continue unabated in armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">Furthermore, the resolution identifies the need to mainstream a gender perspective in conflict prevention, peace negotiations, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance, post-conflict reconstruction and disarmament and demobilization and reintegration initiatives.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">As we all know, women and children are the prime targets during conflict situations and make up a vast majority of all refugees and displaced persons. They bear the brunt of the conflict and are exposed to sexual and gender-based violence, which is unfortunately and sadly used as a weapon of war.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">Despite the disproportionate impact of conflict on women, they continue to hold their families and communities together. They often undertake initiatives across warring factions under extremely difficult conditions. In some cases, they have managed to bring their experiences into formal peace processes. However, those efforts are insufficiently recognized and supported, both politically and financially. As a result, women's rights are rarely integrated into peace agreements or into the structures supporting post-conflict reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">We should recognize that, when we fail to build upon women's strengths, the whole peace process suffers. Without equal participation and full involvement by women in peace processes, we cannot attain justice or development, and women will not be protected from the violence and suffering unleashed during conflict. We are, however, encouraged and pleased that women are gradually finding a place at the negotiating table, in the implementation of peace agreements and in post-conflict rehabilitation, reconstruction and disarmament. The time has come for women to be included in those processes in a more formalized way, at all levels and in all stages of decision-making.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">You will no doubt agree with me, Mr. President, that Namibia has a special attachment to the successful implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. That is so because it was during Namibia's presidency of the Security Council in October 2000 that an open debate and discussions were initiated, culminating in the adoption of the landmark <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, on women and peace and security, which we have the honour of reviewing today. I am happy to note with appreciation that many peace-related programmes have been developed around that resolution and that it has now become an instrument for women's fight for peace in the world.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">My delegation is committed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> because we believe that involving women in peace processes brings a positive dimension to the promotion of peace and security. Furthermore, as a troop-contributing country, we have incorporated gender perspectives and HIV/AIDS awareness into the training manuals for all our uniformed personnel, and we ensure that women are part of the Namibian contingents participating in United Nations peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">My delegation fully agrees with the Secretary-General that sexual and gender-based violence continues to be used as a weapon of war in many conflicts, especially those in Africa. In the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Darfur region of the Sudan, for example, gender-based violence has reached alarming proportions. We deplore such horrendous acts and support the call for every effort to be made to halt those horrible practices and to bring the perpetrators to justice. We could not agree more with the Secretary-General, and we wish here to reiterate his appeal to the international community to do everything it can to translate into reality the objectives of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. What is required is political will.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">My delegation also welcomes the Secretary-General's intention to develop a comprehensive system-wide strategy and action plan for increasing attention to gender perspectives in conflict prevention, with particular emphasis on monitoring and reporting mechanisms, as stated in paragraph 20 of the report.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa11">In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my delegation's full support for the Secretary-General in his efforts to develop a comprehensive strategy and action plan for mainstreaming gender perspectives into peacekeeping activities at Headquarters and in the field, and to urge the Security Council to monitor implementation of the strategy and action plan.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Sweden.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Liden</span> <span class="nation">Sweden</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">Sweden fully aligns itself with the statement made by the representative of the Netherlands on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">It is urgent that we enhance our collective capacity and determination to prevent and respond to gender-based violence and to end impunity. Observations from the Sudan and elsewhere are as horrendous as they are clear. This debate and its focus on protecting women and girls from being victims of gender-based violence, including systematic rape and abduction, is as timely as it is necessary. We must ensure that women have the opportunity to participate in all decision-making processes on equal terms with men. The capacity, experiences and influence of women are essential for equitable and sustainable solutions to armed conflict, for the prevention of new conflicts, for respect for human rights and for long-term development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">We welcome the recommendations put forward by the Secretary-General, and we call for their urgent implementation and adequate financing. Implementation is a shared responsibility of Member States, the United Nations system, non-governmental organizations, regional organizations and others. In the statement just made on behalf of the European Union, several recommendations were put forward. Let me offer some additional ideas.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">First, with regard to the question of women as actors, the Secretary-General could consider instructing United Nations mediators or facilitators to promote the inclusion of women in peace processes and transitional decision-making forums. The specific target of at least 30 per cent women could be set where appropriate. Actions should be evaluated and followed up.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">Secondly, we must redouble our efforts aimed at the protection and security of women and girls from gender-based violence and at ending impunity. We should consider awareness-raising and training that include the role of men and boys. Every effort should be made to prosecute the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including sexual violence. The International Criminal Court should be further strengthened. Abused women must have an opportunity to interact with female members of peacekeeping missions. However, the proportion of women in such missions is still very low. One possibility to be further explored is to include civilian observers in military observer teams, which are often a peacekeeping operation's only presence in certain regions. Civilian observers could facilitate a better gender balance and would also diversify the team's competence, thereby strengthening its ability to carry out its core tasks. Perhaps synergies could be found with the general civilian monitoring capacity that is now being developed within European Union civilian crisis management.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">Thirdly, accountability is lacking, and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> must be implemented in a systematic way. We would like to suggest the development of a comprehensive United Nations action plan with specific timelines and resource implications and clear targets and responsibilities. In that context, increasing female representation within the United Nations should be examined. The Security Council could consider designating a focal point -- possibly supplemented by a working group -- with a particular responsibility to monitor the work done. Another proposal is to establish the post of a gender adviser in the Department of Political Affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">Fourthly, as Member States, we must shoulder our responsibilities. Sweden has established a working group in the Swedish Government offices that brings together the security, defence and development communities to continue the systematic implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. The resources for research and policy studies on issues related to the resolution have been augmented. We will develop a national plan of action, and we hope that other Members will undertake similar efforts and develop and report on their own plans.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">We must make every effort to ensure that our commonly agreed objectives of the full inclusion of women and their enhanced protection from gender-based violence are translated into tangible progress. That will be achieved only when the daily lives of women and girls in conflict-stricken and transitional countries have improved. We have the opportunity, and it is our common responsibility to make use of it. For that, we need commitment, resources and firm political will.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of New Zealand.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Heaton</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">In view of your appeal with regard to the length of statements, Mr. President, I will limit myself to a few brief comments. Copies of the full text of our statement have been circulated.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> is broad in scope, and we think it is valuable to take the time this year to deal with this particular issue in depth: as we have heard from so many speakers today, violence against women in conflict situations is reaching epidemic proportions. We note with particular concern that violence against women and girls continues to be used as a weapon of war.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">New Zealand has identified several priorities to address violence against women and girls in armed conflict. With regard to the United Nations system, first, we support those calling for a new system-wide action plan for the coordinated implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. As part of this, we note that the increasing representation of women at all levels of United Nations operations and decision-making must be an important part of United Nations efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">Secondly, we continue to urge the Security Council to include a systematic and express focus on the gender dimensions of conflict in every case that comes before it. We note that the idea was floated last year of naming a Security Council member to be responsible for tracking implementation of the resolution, and we hope that that idea will be considered seriously by the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">Thirdly, on the specific question of peacekeeping, there is an urgent need to inject a clear gender perspective into all facets of United Nations peacekeeping operations. We note that ensuring that will require adequate resourcing by the Security Council and by us, the Member States. Member States also have a major responsibility to nominate women at all levels of United Nations peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">With regard to the wider United Nations membership, fourthly, we must ensure that we do not just focus on women as victims but recognize their roles as peacemakers and active participants in resolving conflict and building peace at all levels.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">Fifthly, impunity for gender-based violence cannot be accepted, and the international legal framework in place to address gender-based violence in armed conflict must be respected. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which specifically defines rape and other forms of violence against women as war crimes and crimes against humanity, is important in that regard.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of New Zealand for being so cooperative.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Fiji, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kau</span> <span class="nation">Fiji</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">We would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having organized today's debate on this issue. We also congratulate the Secretary-General for his timely report on the follow-up to the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-814.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/814</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">While the Secretary-General's report shows that there have been positive developments in the implementation of the resolution, further concerted efforts are needed to ensure that the issue of implementation is fully addressed. The full implementation of the resolution will continue to be a challenge for the Security Council and for the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">Fiji attaches great importance to this subject, and we commend the efforts made thus far by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions and other United Nations bodies and entities. We commend, in particular, the efforts made by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and by regional organizations and other bodies, including the Commonwealth Secretariat, which have been active partners in following up this issue in Fiji. Our Ministry for Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation has been the focal point of efforts to mainstream gender perspectives in relation to critical peace and security components in Government and other areas.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">The necessary groundwork for the launching in Fiji of national policies and strategies pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> has been greatly boosted by the sponsorship and support of UNIFEM and other actors, including civil society. Work on mainstreaming gender perspectives in relation to conflict prevention, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation is in progress.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">Recent political and internal upheavals in our country have brought out the best in our women, and their contribution has been a strong factor for good and steady progress. They have been effective stabilizers and mediators in conflict prevention and very active players in recent efforts in post-conflict peace-building and reconciliation processes. A week-long peace and reconciliation process with the objective, inter alia, of uniting our polarized and divided country, which was held last month, saw women and children playing key roles. This was preceded by a national workshop on conflict prevention and early warning.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">In peacekeeping, Fiji, which is a staunch supporter of and consistent contributor to international peacekeeping missions, has introduced specific measures to ensure the expansion of women's role in peacekeeping. Despite the difficulties in overcoming cultural and traditional barriers, recent deployments have seen the successful integration of women into various specialized duties, including guard duty. The military and police departments, together with other relevant bodies, are working on coherent strategies for gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping. The Fiji peacekeeping deployment to Iraq will include six women who have been given specific training in searching and in counselling. That also illustrates our view that women can be as good as men in all areas if given the opportunity.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">We fully agree with the Secretary-General that more effort must be put into capacity-building and training. Gender mainstreaming in relation to all facets of peace and security requires knowledge and information-sharing. Training and capacity-building must target not only girls and women, but also boys and men at all levels of government and the community. It should be all-encompassing and comprehensive, targeting both the formal and the non-formal sectors. Its inclusion in the education curriculum will ensure early intervention and sustained impact. The Government, through the programmes of its Ministry for Women and through the UNIFEM-sponsored Women and Peace and Security Committee, is addressing the issue with all relevant stakeholders.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">In addition, there is a need for more effective coordination and partnerships. There is certainly no lack of will and enthusiasm at the national level, particularly in developing countries, but enhanced cooperation and partnership are vital to ensure the inflow of the resources and expertise which are generally lacking in our countries. We therefore welcome the call by the Secretary-General for the development and strengthening of cooperation and effective partnerships at all levels. We acknowledge the good work done by UNIFEM and other United Nations bodies, together with regional organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth Secretariat, in the Pacific region, including in Fiji. We can only hope for more such cooperation and partnerships.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">We also commend the Secretary-General for his recognition of the role of indigenous women in conflict resolution as mediators and peace-builders. Indigenous and local women have a strong advocacy role, and it should be utilized in all aspects of security and peace.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">There is a need to ensure that national and international efforts for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> are undertaken in a comprehensive manner in the context of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. To ensure complementarity and proper coordination, every effort must be undertaken in collaboration with, and within, existing institutional arrangements.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa11">Fiji has a total population of approximately 800,000, with women making up almost half of that number. Given our small population, it was easy for us to recognize the great potential that women represent. In order to make progress, we had to harness all the resources at our disposal, and women have played the prominent role we expected -- and more -- in the measured forward momentum towards our developmental goals. Our support for the efforts of the Security Council and the Secretary-General in the furtherance of women's participation in peace and security is therefore absolute.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Argentina, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mayoral</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">We commend you, Mr. President, for having convened this open meeting on women and peace and security for having scheduled the debate for the fourth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. My country was honoured to have participated in the drafting and adoption of that resolution as a member of the Council at that time.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">I would like to thank Mr. Guéhenno for his briefing on progress achieved in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, as well as Ms. Rwankuba, Ms. Obaid and Ms. Arbour for their briefings on strategies to prevent and respond to situations of gender-based violence in conflict situations -- violence that is, unfortunately, continuing.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">The Argentine delegation has maintained, and will continue to uphold, the vital need for full respect for international humanitarian norms and human rights. War crimes committed against women and girls, recognized as such by the International Criminal Court, pursuant to the Rome Statute, must not and cannot go unpunished. We would like to take this opportunity to urge parties to armed conflicts to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, in particular rape and other forms of sexual abuse that are so humiliating.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">The Government of Argentina would like to express its support for the implementation of some kind of system designed to prevent sexual violence, exploitation and trafficking in women and girls, both within the civilian population and within the military, including appropriate reporting mechanisms that would protect the identity of the complainant and monitoring mechanisms covering personnel of peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">The existence of a gender-component in all field operations seems to us to be a requirement that is increasingly dictated by the reality in the field.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">When any given conflict strikes women, it gravely threatens the future of new generations, undermines the foundation on which the security of families and the systems of social protection should be based, and sets up the worst possible scenario for the psychological, political and socio-economic survival of a particular community. We therefore strongly condemn the manipulation of any conflict by the victors to deny women and girls enjoyment of their fundamental human rights. For that reason we support, and will continue to support, any initiative taken by the Council designed to address the particular needs of women affected by armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">The international community must understand that there is an important role that women can and should play in preventing and resolving conflicts and in peace-building. Armed conflicts affect women in particular, and disproportionately so, and we may safely conclude that women have their own voice that should be heard in forums in which there is discussion of the best ways to avoid or resolve conflicts or to organize the future of the communities affected by those conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">As we have been doing in other forums of this Organization, Argentina urges the Secretary-General to appoint more women as special representatives, special envoys and as spokespersons in missions of good offices relating to peace and preventive diplomacy.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">We also call on Member States to take the gender perspective duly into account, when making national, regional and international level appointments. We support the participation of women at the negotiating tables of peace agreements, in all mechanisms for the implementation of those agreements, and in post-conflict rebuilding processes. In that regard, we urge everyone to set aside archaic, ancient and stereotypical views about the role of women.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">Today, four years after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, Argentina recognizes the significant efforts that have been made by Member States and the United Nations system in general, and by civil society to incorporate a gender perspective in their policies and programmes, to create specific capabilities and to promote full participation for women on an equal basis in maintaining and promoting peace. That work has been important, and we would like to acknowledge it at this stage.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">However, situations of violence affecting women on the ground, make it plain that -- notwithstanding the progress achieved -- much still remains to be done. Argentina, two months before it enters the Security Council once again, calls attention to the full validity of the statements made in the year 2000 and asserts that only a clear-cut commitment, a resolute and sustained political will and genuine conviction on the part of Member States that the participation of women is a key element for achieving lasting peace and concerted multilateral action will be able to guarantee implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">My country also supports the recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his report, in particular, his intention to develop a strategy and comprehensive plan of action to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> throughout the United Nations system by establishing a systematic evaluation mechanism and reporting procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">We are also convinced that those recommendations, the ideas expressed by Member States in the discussion and the important contributions of civil society will be very useful when we come to design the plan of action.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa14">We would also like to highlight the activities of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), the Inter-Agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security and the Department of Public Information, which have contributed to the dissemination and exchange of information.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa15">We are ready to unite our efforts to ensure that all the women of the world may enjoy their rights and freedoms on an equal footing with men, and thus to put an end to impunity in cases of gender-based violence. If we protect women, we believe that we are protecting the future. If we respect women and take them into account, we will be building peace.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa16">Before I close, I would like to express my personal wish, and that of my delegation, that at the next anniversary of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> there will be even more women representing various cultures and participating in this debate.</p>

	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">The discussion of the report on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security is very important to the delegation of Guatemala, first of all, because our country has benefited from the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), which is mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-814.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/814</a>) as one of the peace operations in which three women serve as deputy special representatives.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">Secondly, in accordance with the recommendations of the Secretary-General to encourage the participation of women in peacekeeping operations, we take pride in the fact that Guatemala contributes women to peacekeeping operations. On this very day, a unit of 70 military police officers is leaving to join the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), a contingent that includes 5 women.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">Regarding the work of MINUGUA, that mission worked side by side with Guatemala in a negotiating process that concluded with the signing of the peace agreements in 1996 and called for profound changes in our society with an agenda that the Government of Guatemala has adopted as a minimum. MINUGUA gave significant support towards improving the prevailing situation. Now it is incumbent on us, as Guatemalans, to build a fairer society that will overcome the exclusion, marginalization and discrimination that we have suffered, affecting not only the indigenous peoples but also women in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">In September of this year, MINUGUA inaugurated at United Nations Headquarters an exhibition of photography entitled, "Guatemala -- Images of Peace", which, apart from demonstrating the mission's activities, also showed the great challenges that we must confront and overcome, including poverty and gender equality, which are two fundamental elements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> that we are now addressing.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">Because of our experience and because we are a country that has emerged from an armed conflict that impoverished us for 36 years, Guatemala is convinced of the need to enhance the prevalence of women in the processes of decision-making and of the valuable contribution women make to the maintenance of international peace and security. An educated woman, free of discrimination and subjugation, is the best guarantee for achieving sustainable development and securing peaceful and harmonious social coexistence. For that reason, we urge the Security Council to establish and promote strategies and programmes to prevent gender-based violence. We also support the establishment of systems to protect victims and witnesses that bring charges of that kind of crime. In that regard, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Guatemala has an office of victim care -- a unit which provides humanitarian assistance and comprehensive and urgent care in order to minimize the negative effects of the crime. We agree with the Secretary-General that the dissemination and exchange of information are vital in order to raise awareness of the contents of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">We congratulate the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) on creating a web site that offers a centralized database, and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) for the work it has done in compiling information resources on gender-related aspects of conflicts and peace, as well as in managing the inter-agency task force on an electronic database of gender training materials. We believe there needs to be better coordination among Member States, United Nations agencies and civil society actors, so as to systematically mainstream the gender perspective and disseminate the content of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> in terms of conflict prevention, planning peacekeeping operations and post-conflict peace-building, which cannot be successful or complete if women do not fully participate in them.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I now call on the representative of Norway.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Strømmen</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">Norway aligns itself with the statement made by Canada on behalf of the Human Security Network. What follows are a few remarks in our national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">We would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-814.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/814</a>) on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women, peace and security. The Security Council's monitoring of the implementation of this resolution is an effective and important way of keeping the international community's attention focused on gender perspectives and on women's roles in the area of peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">As of June 2004 women constituted one per cent of military personnel and five per cent of civilian police personnel assigned by Member States to serve in United Nations peacekeeping operations. These low figures indicate that we, the Member States, must do more to recruit women to our national services in order for them to gain relevant work experience for international service.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">It is a tough challenge to increase the number of women in high-level decision-making positions in peacekeeping operations. Norway welcomes the efforts of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) to encourage female candidates to apply for peacekeeping operations. Last year DPKO established a gender focal point. We strongly support that decision. It is vital that DPKO now ensure that the gender adviser is instrumental in mainstreaming the gender dimension into all phases of peacekeeping operations, beginning with the initial planning of new operations and throughout their implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">Responsibility for mainstreaming the gender perspective rests with the leadership. That responsibility must be assumed by leadership at all levels -- from this Council to commanders in the field. According to the Secretary-General's report, only 15 per cent of the Security Council's resolutions adopted from January 2002 to June 2004 incorporated gender concerns. Is that good enough? We are convinced that gender mainstreaming is crucial to creating stability and lasting peace. We encourage the Security Council to pay increased attention to gender issues and the role of women in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">Member States, together with the United Nations, should put even greater effort into giving women a role in formal decision-making. This would be an important encouragement for more women to become involved at the informal level as well. Both women's and men's points of view need to be integrated into peace agreements. Sustainable peace can only be achieved if both women and men are listened to.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">It is vital to work in partnerships and enhance co-ordination in order to facilitate the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> at all levels. Women's groups and networks at the local level are crucial. It is essential to draw on the experience of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and researchers and on formal and informal contacts, in order to identify women's views and needs in peace processes. Norway is doing its part. We are focusing on how to advocate women's recommendations for sustainable peace in areas where we are involved in conflict resolution. We do this through partnerships with networks at the local level, NGOs, researchers, individual States and various parts of the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">The real test of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> will take place on the ground. We are therefore pleased to see that many parts of the United Nations system, including DPKO, funds, programmes and specialized agencies, are participating in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. Their ability to find practical solutions and cooperate among themselves and with others is critical to achieving results. UNIFEM is making a concerted effort in this field, and we must ensure that it plays its mandated role as a catalyst in the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">According to the report, the peacekeeping and humanitarian areas have seen the most dramatic improvements in terms of new policies, gender expertise and training initiatives since 2002. We support the Secretary-General's suggestion to develop a comprehensive strategy and action plan for mainstreaming gender perspectives into peacekeeping efforts both at Headquarters and in peacekeeping operations.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">I now call on the representative of Indonesia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Asmady</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">My delegation would like to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-814.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/814</a>) on the situation regarding women, peace and security. Not only does the report encourage us with achievements to date but it also challenges us to further action in order to fully implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. The resolution emphasizes the importance of women being equal partners in building a culture of peace globally, as a means of both prevention and cure for conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">Indonesia supports the implementation of the resolution because its provisions are in line with our national policies. Operating on the principle that women should enjoy equality in all spheres of society, Indonesia supports gender mainstreaming into the peacekeeping and peace-building work of the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Towards this end, Indonesia fully encourages all United Nations entities, other international organizations and civil society to cooperate and, where possible, to coordinate their efforts to bring women into the decision-making process.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">In addition to these measures, Indonesia anticipates that greater use will be made of the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality established under the Inter-Agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security. The Network should strengthen efforts to ensure collaboration and coordination throughout the United Nations system. It could perhaps also be used to encourage coordination beyond the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">The undeniable fact, however, is that, while there is widespread recognition of the valuable role that women can play, their full involvement in peace processes is unfortunately slow in coming. This slowness constitutes the main stumbling block to women's participation. With adequate funding, progress could be greatly accelerated.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">Because the resolution has not yet been fully implemented, women continue to be vulnerable to the many dangers posed by armed conflict, including acts of sexual violence. Indonesia condemns the use of sexual violence as a weapon of warfare in conflict situations. However, categorizing such acts as crimes against humanity deserves further careful consideration before we settle on such a classification.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">With regard to the human rights of women, Indonesia is firmly convinced that their rights must be respected at all times, even in situations of conflict. International law underscores our continuing humanity, even on the battlefield. Combatants must therefore not sexually exploit women as acts of war. The challenge to protect and promote the human rights of women and girls in armed conflict is therefore a challenge that must be met by all civilized societies.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">In this respect, it is also imperative that peacekeepers and civilian police not contribute to the further suffering of women in situations of conflict. Their involvement in such behaviour is both unacceptable and a clear betrayal of the trust placed in them. Their duty is to preserve the peace and help create conditions for the rehabilitation of war-torn societies.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">To correct this situation, it is important and necessary for all peacekeepers to be exposed to gender-sensitive training programmes as part of their induction. Likewise, they should also benefit from HIV/AIDS awareness training programmes. On this matter, Indonesia agrees that peacekeepers should be held to the same standards of conduct as required of combat personnel, according to the Secretary-General's Bulletin.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">To win the peace and keep it, women must be made parties to peace negotiations. They should also be able to exercise their political rights, especially the right to vote, in post-conflict societies. There must also be systematic incorporation of gender perspectives into the planning, implementation and monitoring of all reconstruction programmes and budgets. This should ensure that women and girls enjoy the same benefits that men do in post-conflict societies.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">Indonesia wholeheartedly supports the speedy implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. However, we believe there is a need for further deliberation prior to the implementation of the recommendations before us. It is our view that the proposed changes must be carried out throughout the United Nations system. This point is being made because we apparently face the risk that, as the author of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, the Security Council exclusively will decide on the issues. Such an approach would deprive many developing countries of the opportunity to make contributions to the decision-making process.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Vargas</span> <span class="nation">Honduras</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">There can be no peace without justice. Without the tangible support of justice, women will continue to be victims of violence, for lack of an instrument for world peace and security. Women who survive war have the hard task of surviving in the future that war leaves them. They face humiliation, desolation, despair and the burden of supporting their families in a world that has shown itself to be, at the very least, savage.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">We cannot talk of peace and security unless we take concrete action to tackle the terrible injustices people experience in the world of war. Those injustices break the peaceful soul of communities, restrict the participation of women in the socio-economic and political spheres and leave the next generation weak in health, opportunities and hope for equality.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">There is international awareness. However, women today still do not have a truly influential role in peace negotiations or in the elaboration of economic policies and programmes. On many occasions, they do not even have an active role in the decisions made in their own families. Change has to begin at home, in the expectations among families and communities of what women can contribute. There has to be a conviction that women must prepare themselves for taking a key and equal role in peace processes. To put it most simply, relations between woman and man must be improved at all levels. It is a question of not allowing justice to be sacrificed to the quest for freedom and peace.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">Important strategic plans have been proposed to foster the participation and protection of women in war and peace, but action is largely lacking. There is talk of involving women in peace processes, but even the most basic support has failed to materialize. Without that support, the role of women in the search for peace and security will continue to be limited. Women know the brutality of war over a shared history passed down from one generation to the next. It has been shown that because of their vision and special skills, women bring to the table of peace negotiations a supremely valuable ability and dedication to contribute to world security. Without a fair opportunity for the participation of women, peace will be long in coming.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">Women need to be judges, governors, negotiators and business people. They must help to rebuild the world when it has been beaten down by conflict. Women must be present at every stage of decision-making for democracy, peace and justice. Only that way will there be protection from violence and violence be prevented, in times of peace and in times of war.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">The Government of Honduras is committed to supporting all initiatives to strengthen the participation of women. That will undoubtedly have a positive impact on speeding world development.</p>

	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Kenya.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Bahemuka</span> <span class="nation">Kenya</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">My delegation is greatly honoured by the opportunity to participate in today's debate on women and peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">Stories have been told in many forums of ordinary women whose love for peace drove them to spontaneously reach across battle lines to assist victims of war, and of women who disregarded ethnic barriers in civil wars and jointly demanded their right to peace. Stories have been told of women who overcame formidable political, cultural and economic obstacles to assert their place in peace processes. Some of us may vividly recall images of a group of women peace activists who, in recent peace negotiations on the continent of Africa, threatened to lock negotiators in the negotiating room and sit on the keys until peace was agreed upon. Those gestures, and many other initiatives by women all over the world, demonstrate the desire of women to attain peace. There is no doubt in my mind that women hold the key to peace in the world.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, adopted by the Security Council on 31 October 2000, reaffirmed the role of women in the search for peace. It recognized women's special vulnerability during times of armed conflict and stressed the need for their equal participation and full involvement in efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Most important, it underscored the need to mainstream gender perspectives in all initiatives for conflict prevention, peace negotiations, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance, post-conflict reconstruction and reintegration. In a nutshell, the resolution legitimized women's place at the peace table. For that milestone, Kenya is grateful to the Council and the various other United Nations bodies that worked tirelessly towards that end.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">Kenya expresses its deep gratitude to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive and balanced report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-814.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/814</a>) on implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, presented to the Council for consideration. The report provides several illustrative examples of areas where tangible progress has been achieved. It also acknowledges the formidable gaps and challenges that stand in the way of implementation of the resolution. My delegation believes that drawing inspiration from our success so far will provide a source of strength in our efforts to tackle the remaining challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">Investing in women can pay dividends in the Organization's continued search for peace and security. Faced with entrenched discriminatory laws, policies and customs, many women are barred from playing a significant role in peace processes. It is incumbent upon the United Nations, other international bodies and national Governments to support the struggle of women for greater participation in those processes. Thus, we welcome the various initiatives enumerated in the Secretary-General's report, which seek to mainstream gender perspectives in peace processes by, inter alia, developing policies, action plans, guidelines and indicators aimed at promoting the role of women.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">During armed conflict, women often emerge as the only voices of reason and calm. That strength of women can be harnessed into seeking durable, peaceful solutions to conflicts. Women's perceptions and concerns must form an integral part of any peace process. We must break the traditional, stereotypical barriers that have consistently kept women away from negotiating tables. In that regard, it is gratifying to note that the United Nations has made significant progress in mainstreaming gender perspectives in peace initiatives.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">We thus welcome the recent development by the Division for the Advancement of Women of a framework of model provisions on promoting gender equality and a set of standards for mediators, facilitators and funding entities involved in peace negotiations. Those guidelines, we believe, will provide an invaluable tool to the facilitators of those processes.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">Kenya is aware of the fact that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has made great strides in promoting gender balance among peacekeeping personnel. Its current approach of establishing multidimensional peacekeeping operations, such as those in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Timor-Leste and Afghanistan, has proved to be very effective in placing the focus on gender issues in peacekeeping.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">The incorporation of full-time gender advisers into peacekeeping missions has been very useful in that regard. Though gender balance is far from being attained, we have taken steps in the right direction. DPKO should redouble its efforts towards achieving that goal. It must develop and disseminate to Member States, especially troop-contributing countries, effective guidelines to ensure sustained efforts in gender mainstreaming at all levels of peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">In conclusion, I wish to thank the Security Council most sincerely for remaining seized of this matter. It is through constant reflection and the sharing of experiences on the role of women in peace and security that the international community will successfully restore women to their rightful place at the peace table.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wali</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">Nigeria welcomes this open debate on the important issue of women, peace and security. We recall that the item was first discussed shortly before the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> of October 2000. We note that the debate is taking place on the fourth anniversary of the unanimous adoption of the resolution. We also recall with interest that the landmark resolution reaffirmed the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building and peacekeeping. It also reaffirmed the role of women in humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction and stressed the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">In situations of conflict, women and children constitute the vast majority of civilian casualties, as they are the most vulnerable. Many women and children suffer forcible displacement, injury and death. They also suffer greater difficulties in making a living during and after conflict, in addition to other indignities, such as torture and rape. Consequently, Nigeria believes that all efforts aimed at conflict resolution and peace-building should include the strengthening of the safety of women through the maintenance of the rule of law and the protection of women's rights.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa03">The Government of Nigeria has long recognized the importance and significant contribution of women to national development and, in particular, their role in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building efforts. In that regard, the Nigerian Constitution guarantees the participation and representation of women at all levels of Government. That includes women's participation in the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts and in politics.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa04"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> recognizes the negative impact of armed conflict on women and the need for effective institutional arrangements to guarantee their protection. It also recognizes that the full participation of women in the peace process would contribute significantly to the maintenance and promotion of international peace and security. The resolution further encourages the incorporation of a gender perspective into United Nations peacekeeping operations and calls for measures that would ensure the protection of and respect for the rights of women and children.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa05">Nigeria reiterates its support for the resolution. In particular, we commend the mainstreaming of the gender perspective into peacekeeping operations. In that regard, it is gratifying to recall that, over the last decade, the international legal framework has recognized the need to address some of the particular crimes and indignities suffered by women and girls in armed conflict. Such crimes include rape, enforced prostitution, and the trafficking and enslavement of women. We welcome the fact that such crimes are included in the definitions of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and as components of the crimes of genocide and torture. In addition, there has been an increasing awareness and recognition of the peculiar circumstances and plight of women and girls during armed conflict and its aftermath, particularly in relation to sexual violence.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa06">The international community cannot afford to continue to ignore the exposure of women and children to the dangers of communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases to which women are vulnerable. We note that the plight of women is particularly exacerbated in situations where conflicts have destroyed the health care infrastructure necessary for prevention and cure. There is therefore a need to rebuild health and social services, develop appropriate legal institutions, create administrative structures, establish mine action programmes, repatriate refugees and deliver humanitarian aid to women and girls who suffer abuse.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa07">We recognize that no lasting peace can be established without the participation of women and girls and the inclusion of gender perspectives in both formal and informal peace processes. That is clearly in conformity with the Windhoek Declaration and the Namibia Plan of Action on Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Support Operations. The United Nations and the international community should therefore ensure that all peace accords address the consequences of the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, their contribution to the peace process and their needs and priorities in the aftermath of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa08">In line with the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, Nigeria, as a major troop-contributing country, includes women as members of its peacekeeping troops. That is in recognition of women as able partners in all spheres of development, particularly in peace initiatives and post-conflict resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa09">We are concerned that, although <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> called for the establishment of the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues, regrettably, that Office is not adequately staffed and funded. The fact that the Office is funded through voluntary contributions has limited its financial capacity and thus its ability to perform. Accordingly, we call for better funding from the United Nations regular budget to enable the Office to implement fully the humanitarian and human rights laws that protect the rights of women and girls during and after conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa10">We are also concerned that the requirement for the gender training of peacekeeping personnel, as contained in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the resolution under consideration, is not being implemented. We therefore urge that the gender training module -- which, indeed, is compulsory for peacekeepers during their induction programme -- be implemented. In that regard, we welcome DPKO's effort to develop a gender and peacekeeping training package. To further improve the situation, we call on DPKO to set up a mechanism for the sharing of best practices with troop-contributing countries on strategies aimed at the recruitment of women.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, we reaffirm our support for <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and call for improved implementation of gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations. In particular, we call for an increase in the number of female experts as members of United Nations peacekeeping operations, as well as the active involvement of women in every peace process. In our view, that would facilitate the deployment of such female experts to counsel and deal with the peculiar needs of women who are victims of abuse.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">I am pleased to associate myself with the comments of those who have commented favourably on the quality of the presentation and papers we have received and thank you and the members of the Security Council for organizing this debate. I am also very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, which affirms the role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. The 53 member States of the Commonwealth, representing a third of the world's population, work together to promote peace, democracy, good governance, respect for human rights and the reduction of poverty through economic and social development.</p>

The Secretary-General's good offices work is supported by efforts to mainstream a gender perspective into peace and conflict management processes, a role that was reaffirmed by Commonwealth heads of Government when they met in Abuja in 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">Building on initiatives and taking into consideration recent global developments, the Commonwealth ministers responsible for women and gender affairs adopted a ten-year plan in Fiji in May 2004, covering the period 2005-2015. That plan also focuses on the importance of peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">Women and children remain deliberate targets in armed conflicts everywhere, yet they are not provided with opportunities to participate in negotiating peace agreements and in reconciliation and post-conflict reconstruction activities. Nor are they involved in finding solutions to lack of services such as education and health, or in resolving issues such as food security, gender-based violence and gender-based crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Despite those challenges and exclusions, women in the Commonwealth and beyond still play a crucial role in maintaining and building the social fabric during, and in the aftermath of, conflicts. Specially to be commended in that regard are the women of Papua New Guinea and Bougainville, Solomon Islands and Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">In order to ensure that women play their fair role in conflict resolution, the Commonwealth Secretariat has developed an integrated approach involving men, women and young persons in promoting a culture of peace, resolving conflicts and increasing women's representation and participation at all levels of the peace-building processes -- Sierra Leone being a particularly good example of that work. In addition, we organized a sub-Saharan ministerial conference focusing on a programme of strategies in universal primary education in conflict-affected countries. That resulted in the Mombasa declaration, urging Governments to use education as a force for peace-building, conflict prevention, conflict resolution and nation-building.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">The Commonwealth's challenge is to strengthen its support for, and deepen its partnership with, member countries and other stakeholders to prevent and resolve conflicts before they translate into loss of lives and livelihoods. We must promote increased women's participation and representation in peace-building, conflict resolution and post-conflict reconstruction processes -- and, indeed, the resolution of conflicts through dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">As my Secretary-General has noted, conflict resolution is about battles that were not fought, blood that was not spilled and children, women and men who did not die.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">The positive contributions of women within the Commonwealth and throughout the world can no longer be ignored. I wish to quote the Governor of Bougainville, speaking about the unsung heroes:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg025-bk02-pa11">"It is time that the world and the people of Bougainville appreciated the tremendous potentiality that is inherent in this so-called weaker sex. In many, many ways they are much, much stronger."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa12">I urge the Council today to celebrate those unsung heroes of peace-building and conflict resolution: women -- whether from Bougainville, the Fiji Islands, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste, Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Afghanistan or wherever there is conflict -- by providing them essential spaces at all negotiating tables and by implementing this landmark resolution.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">I would now like to call the Director of the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, Ms. Carmen Moreno.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Moreno</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01"> As this is the first time that the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) addresses the Security Council, let me thank you, Mr. President, and through you the members of the Council, for the opportunity to join in recognizing the importance of the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">As the international community redefines security in the twenty-first century, women's contributions and gender considerations are now, thanks to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, an integral part of the process, and no longer a silent presence.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">INSTRAW launched a profound restructuring this year. The Executive Board has approved a strategic framework and programme of work for 2005. We are reconstructing our relations with stakeholders and building synergies and alliances within the United Nations system, especially with the Division for the Advancement of Women and the United Nations Development Fund for Women.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">INSTRAW considers gender-based violence to be the largest threat to women's security in conflict and post-conflict situations. The need to fully implement international humanitarian and human rights law to ensure the protection of women and girls, as established in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, is therefore crucial.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">Zero tolerance for rape, beatings, assault, harassment and sexual violence in times of armed conflict, as well as for trafficking and abduction into modern slavery and towards the spread of HIV/AIDS through violence, is crucial. Regional and national action plans, legal provisions and law enforcement capacities must be strengthened. It is essential that we realize our collective responsibility and raise the level of political will, cooperation and coordination. INSTRAW has addressed this topic by publishing <i>Partners in Change: Working With Men to End Gender-based Violence</i>, which is available on our new web site and is at the disposal of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">Further contributing to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, INSTRAW is launching areas of research and capacity-building that include gender and security sector reform and gender and conflict prevention and resolution. We are also undertaking collaborative activities towards the elimination of trafficking in women and girls. Through e-discussions, research and consultations, INSTRAW is identifying the most urgent gaps within those fields and building collaborative projects to address them.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">INSTRAW is contributing to the design of a process of capacity-building to facilitate the participation of women and civil society in peace-building activities in Haiti. We are also engaged in the process of developing an action plan on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> in the Dominican Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">INSTRAW highlights the recommendations of the non-governmental organizations Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, and Kvinna till Kvinna. Initiatives that deserve consideration and support are the call for a focal point and an expert-level working group on the integration of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> in the Security Council's work, the establishment of a United Nations system-wide action plan, annual reporting and the need to develop national action plans on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa09">INSTRAW is certain that the Council will ensure, through those and other initiatives, the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. INSTRAW will continue to contribute within its mandate to that effort and looks forward to cooperating with the Council on those issues.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to what has been a very good debate.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa02">There are no speakers remaining on my list.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the continuing and full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and welcomes the increasing focus on the situation of women and girls in armed conflict since the adoption of that resolution in October 2000. The Council recalls the statement by its President of 31 October 2002 and the meeting held on 29 October 2003 as valuable demonstrations of that commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa05">"The Security Council also recalls the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (<a href="../pdf/A-52-231.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/231</a>) and the outcome document of the twenty-third special session of the United Nations General Assembly entitled 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century' <i>(A/S-23/10/Rev.1)</i>, in particular the commitments concerning women and armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the Report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-814.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/814</a>) and expresses its intention to study its recommendations. The Council welcomes the efforts of the United Nations system, Member States, civil society and other relevant actors to promote the equal participation of women in efforts to build sustainable peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa07">"The Security Council strongly condemns the continued acts of gender-based violence in situations of armed conflict. The Council also condemns all violations of the human rights of women and girls in situations of armed conflict and the use of sexual exploitation, violence and abuse. The Council urges the complete cessation by all parties of such acts with immediate effect. The Council stresses the need to end impunity for such acts as part of a comprehensive approach to seeking peace, justice, truth and national reconciliation. The Council welcomes the efforts of the United Nations system to establish and implement strategies and programmes to prevent and report on gender-based violence, and urges the Secretary-General to further his efforts in this regard. The Council requests the Secretary-General to ensure that human rights monitors and members of commissions of inquiry have the necessary expertise and training in gender-based crimes and in the conduct of investigations, including in a culturally sensitive manner favourable to the needs, dignity and rights of the victims. The Council urges all international and national courts specifically established to prosecute war-related crimes to provide gender expertise, gender training for all staff and gender-sensitive programmes for victims and witness protection. The Council emphasizes the urgent need for programmes that provide support to survivors of gender-based violence. The Council further requests that appropriate attention is given to the issue of gender-based violence in all future reports to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa08">"The Security Council reaffirms the important role of women in the prevention of conflict and supports the Secretary-General's intention to develop a comprehensive system-wide strategy and action plan for increasing attention to gender perspectives in conflict prevention. The Council urges all relevant actors to work collaboratively, including through strengthened interaction with women's organizations, to ensure the full participation of women and the incorporation of a gender perspective in all conflict prevention work.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa09">"The Security Council also welcomes the Secretary-General's intention to develop a comprehensive strategy and action plan for mainstreaming a gender perspective into all peacekeeping activities and operations and to incorporate gender perspectives in each thematic and country report to the Council. In support of this process, the Council reaffirms its commitment to integrate fully gender perspectives into the mandates of all peacekeeping missions. The Council recognizes the contribution of the gender adviser within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to advancing the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, and requests the Secretary-General to consider an equivalent arrangement within the Department of Political Affairs to further support such implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa10">"The Security Council considers that an increase in the representation of women in all aspects of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace-building operations and humanitarian response is urgently needed. To that end, the Council urges the Secretary-General to strengthen his efforts to identify suitable female candidates, including, as appropriate, from troop-contributing countries, in conformity with Article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations and taking into account the principle of equitable geographical balance. Such efforts should include the implementation of targeted recruitment strategies and also seek to identify candidates for senior level positions, including in the military and civilian police services.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa11">"The Security Council recognizes the vital contribution of women in promoting peace and their role in reconstruction processes. The Council welcomes the Secretary-General's intention to develop strategies to encourage women's full participation in all stages of the peace process. The Council also requests the Secretary-General to encourage gender mainstreaming in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes by developing guidelines to increase attention to the needs of women and girls in such programmes. The Council further requests the Secretary-General to mainstream a gender perspective in all aspects of post-conflict reconstruction programmes, including through the strengthening of gender theme groups in countries emerging from conflict, and to ensure that all policies and programmes in support of post-conflict constitutional, judicial and legislative reform, including truth and reconciliation and electoral processes, promote the full participation of women, gender equality and women's human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa12">"The Security Council recognizes the important contribution of civil society to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and encourages Member States to continue to collaborate with civil society, in particular with local women's networks and organizations, in order to strengthen implementation. To that end, the Council welcomes the efforts of Member States in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> at the national level, including the development of national action plans, and encourages Member States to continue to pursue such implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa13">"The Security Council recognizes that significant progress has been made in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> in certain areas of the United Nations peace and security work. The Council expresses its readiness to further promote the implementation of this resolution, and in particular through active cooperation with the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly. In order to further consolidate this progress, the Council requests the Secretary-General to submit to the Security Council in October 2005 an action plan, with time lines, for implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> across the United Nations system, with a view to strengthening commitment and accountability at the highest levels, as well as to allow for improved accountability, monitoring and reporting on progress on implementation within the United Nations system."</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-40.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/40</a>.</p>
