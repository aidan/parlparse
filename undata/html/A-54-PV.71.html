	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">I call on the Rapporteur of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, Mr. Fayssal Mekdad of the Syrian Arab Republic, to introduce the report of the Special Committee.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">As Rapporteur of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, I have the honour to present the report of the Special Committee for consideration by the General Assembly. The report is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/54/23</a>, Parts I to III, and covers the work the Special Committee carried out during 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">The report is being submitted in accordance with paragraph 11 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-68.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 53/68</a> regarding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, in which the Special Committee was requested to continue its efforts for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and to carry out those actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism in all territories that have not yet exercised their right to self-determination.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">In an effort to rationalize its work and to facilitate the consideration of this item by the General Assembly, the Special Committee has restructured its report into three parts rather than the usual nine. All of its recommendations for action by the General Assembly for this year are set out in Part III.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">Part I contains the general introductory chapters, which describe the organization and activities of the Committee, the meetings it organized to consider all the matters it was entrusted with, and its relations with other United Nations bodies and with intergovernmental, non-governmental and regional organizations. I draw attention in particular to section J of Part I, which outlines the future programme of work that the Committee intends to carry out during 2000, which is the last year of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. For the first time, Part I also includes as an annex the report of the Caribbean Regional Seminar to review the political, economic and social conditions in the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories, held in Saint Lucia, which is thus being made more easily available to the members of the General Assembly. The Special Committee took into consideration the recommendations of that seminar in formulating its future plans.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">Part II of the report covers the Committee's deliberations regarding the substantive issues on its agenda. These include the dissemination of information on decolonization; the question of sending visiting missions to the Territories; economic and other activities that affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories; military activities carried out by the administering Powers in the Territories under their administration; and the implementation of the Declaration by specialized agencies and international institutions. It also contains information from the Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 of the Charter of the United Nations and describes the actions taken by the Committee regarding each of the 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">Finally, as stated earlier, part III of the report in <a href="../pdf/A-54-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/54/23</a> contains all the recommendations of the Special Committee. The draft resolutions and decisions will be presented in proper order by the Rapporteur of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) in his report to the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">The Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples has formulated specific proposals for the elimination of the remaining manifestations of colonialism. It has examined the implementation by Member States of resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions on decolonization. It has continued to pay special attention to the small Territories and to recommend the most suitable steps which would enable the people of those Territories to exercise their right to self-determination; it has taken steps to enlist worldwide support among Governments and regional, national and international organizations to achieve the objectives of the Declaration and to implement the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. It has requested the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to provide economic, social and other assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories. It has made much effort to engage the administering Powers in a dialogue to seek their cooperation in the discharge of the mandate entrusted to it and for all administering Powers to work formally with the Special Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa08">The proposals presented by the Special Committee are based on a case-by-case examination of the Territories under its mandate. These have been formulated and adopted after due consideration of all aspects of the situation prevailing in the Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the constitutional and political situation and socio-economic developments. Working papers prepared by the Secretariat have provided substantive information and data on each Non-Self-Governing Territory. These working papers are based on information provided by the administering Powers under Article 73 <i>e </i>of the Charter. Valuable information has also been received from representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, who participate in the meetings of the Special Committee and in its regional seminars. Media reports and information provided by regional non-governmental organizations and experts have also been useful sources. It is the view of the Special Committee that sending visiting missions to the Non-Self-Governing Territories themselves would be the best way of gaining first-hand knowledge and would provide an opportunity to review the situation on the ground. The Special Committee has not been able to do this for some time now. However, in its absence, the regional seminars have provided a close alternative when held in the vicinity of some of the Territories. They serve as an opportunity for Committee members to have direct contact with some of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories in environments similar to their own. These regional seminars have been crucial in bringing together representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories, Non-governmental organizations, experts and scholars to interact and exchange views on changes and developments in the Territories. They share information on issues of common concern, present papers and propose actions relevant to the question of decolonization and have direct access to the members of the Special Committee in an informal environment in order to discuss their views and concerns. I draw the Assembly's attention again to the report of the Caribbean Regional Seminar annexed to part I of the Committee's report.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa09">However, as part of the critical review of its work initiated by the Special Committee, and in a spirit of transparency and cooperation, informal consultations with the administering Powers have been carried out during the period under review. These consultations have sought the cooperation of the administering Powers within the context of a renewed dialogue. During the period under review, Portugal participated in the work of the Special Committee in relation to East Timor, France participated in relation to New Caledonia and New Zealand in relation to Tokelau. The Committee also acceded to the requests of Spain to participate in the proceedings on the question of Gibraltar and to the delegations of Argentina and Uruguay -- on behalf of the States members of the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) plus Bolivia and Chile -- to participate in the consideration of the item on the Falkland Islands (Malvinas).</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa10">This year, the Special Committee, pursuant to its decision of 11 August 1998 concerning Puerto Rico considered a report on this issue and adopted a resolution (A/AC.109/1999/28). By the terms of its resolution, the Special Committee reaffirmed the hope that the Government of the United States of America will expedite a process that will allow the people of Puerto Rico to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, in conformity with resolution 1514 (XV) and resolutions and decisions of the Special Committee on Puerto Rico. It also encouraged the Government of the United States to order the halt of its armed forces military drills and manoeuvres on Vieques island and to return the occupied land to the people of Puerto Rico.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa11">The Special Committee has discharged the tasks entrusted to it by the Assembly during the year in a cooperative, transparent and pragmatic effort, with both formal and informal meetings, to reach agreements and formulate its recommendations. It has held wide consultations with its members, as well as with other Member States, administering Powers and representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Altogether it has held 16 formal meetings and 22 informal meetings and consultations. Allow me, very briefly, to outline some of the actions and recommendations being put before the Assembly for its consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa12">The Special Committee examined the issue of information regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories being transmitted to the Secretary-General under Article 73 <i>e </i>of the United Nations Charter. It has reiterated its recommendation to the General Assembly that, in the absence of a decision by the Assembly itself to the effect that a Territory had attained a full measure of self-government in the terms of Chapter XI of the Charter, the administering Power concerned should continue to transmit information under Article 73 <i>e </i>with respect to that Territory.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa13">In its consideration of the question of economic and other activities that affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Special Committee affirms the value of foreign economic investment undertaken in collaboration with the peoples of the Territories. It reaffirms the responsibility of the administering Powers to promote economic advancement in Territories under their administration. At the same time, the Special Committee also affirms the need to avoid any economic and other activities that would adversely affect the interests of the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Therefore, the Special Committee recommends, among other things, that the Assembly urge the administering Powers to take effective measures to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable right of peoples in Non-Self-Governing Territories to their natural resources, and requests the administering Powers to take all necessary steps to protect the property rights of the peoples of those Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa14">The Special Committee has continued to pay special attention to the needs of the small island Territories. Their unique problems, arising from their small size and population, their limited natural resources and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards, require the sustained cooperation and assistance of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system. Reaffirming that the exercise of the right of self-determination by Non-Self-Governing Territories entails, as a corollary, the extension of all appropriate assistance to their inhabitants, the Special Committee paid particular attention to the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations. It welcomes the assistance provided so far, but notes that only some specialized agencies and organizations of the United Nations system have been involved in providing assistance to Non-Self-Governing Territories. It urges those agencies and organizations that have not yet provided assistance to do so as soon as possible. The Special Committee will continue to consult with the Economic and Social Council in its efforts to implement the Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa15">In particular, the Special Committee requests the specialized agencies and other organizations to provide information on the special needs and vulnerabilities of small island Territories, including ways and means to assist the Territories in fighting drug trafficking and other criminal activities. In this regard, the Special Committee recommends to the General Assembly that it request the relevant agencies, organizations and institutions of the United Nations system to strengthen existing measures of support and to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, within the framework of their respective mandates, in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa16">In addition, the Special Committee also recommends that the General Assembly welcome the adoption by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean of resolution 574 (XVII). This resolution calls for the provision of necessary mechanisms to permit its associate members, including the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories, to participate -- subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly -- in certain special sessions of the General Assembly in which the Territories originally participated as observers, and in the work of the Economic and Social Council.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa17">In 1999 the Special Committee continued to examine the question of military activities in Non-Self-Governing Territories. It reaffirms its strong conviction that the existence of military activities and installations in Non-Self-Governing Territories could constitute an obstacle to the exercise of self-determination. It urges administering Powers to take all necessary measures not to involve those Territories in any offensive acts or acts of interference against other States. It reiterates that the Territories and adjacent areas should not be used for nuclear tests, dumping of nuclear waste or deployment of nuclear weapons. Further, it deplores the continued alienation of land, particularly in the small island Territories of the Pacific and the Caribbean, for military installations. While taking note of the decision of some administering Powers to downsize their military presence in Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Special Committee calls once again upon the administering Powers to terminate military activities in Non-Self-Governing Territories and to eliminate their bases in these Territories, in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa18">Regarding the dissemination of information, the Special Committee has remained mindful of the importance of public opinion and the support of Governments, non-governmental organizations and other institutions in effectively assisting the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories achieve self-determination. Consequently, the Special Committee has deemed it important that the Department of Public Information continue to disseminate information on decolonization through all available media, including publications, radio, television and the Internet. I should like to point out, in this respect, the effective participation of the Department of Public Information in publicizing the proceedings of the Caribbean Regional Seminar, held in Saint Lucia in May 1999. Furthermore, before the end of this year, with the assistance of the Department of Public Information, a Web site on decolonization is to be launched on the Internet.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa19">During the last year, the Special Committee continued to monitor and examine the situation in each Territory under its mandate and to hold hearings at which it considered the views of representatives of the Territories and of non-governmental organizations, as well as of other experts. As noted earlier, part III of the Special Committee's report contains its complete recommendations to the General Assembly regarding individual Territories. I refer members to the relevant sections of the report, while highlighting here some selected recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa20">In the interests of all the people of New Caledonia, and building on the positive outcome of the review of the Matignon and Nouméa Accords, the Special Committee urges all parties involved to maintain their dialogue in a spirit of harmony and to continue promoting a framework for the peaceful progress of the Territory towards an act of self-determination in which all options are open and which would safeguard the rights of all New Caledonians according to the letter and the spirit of the Matignon and Nouméa Accords.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa21">The Special Committee also considered 11 small island Territories: American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guam, Montserrat, Pitcairn, St. Helena, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands. In general, it continues to reaffirm the responsibility of the administering Powers under the Charter to promote the economic and social development of the Territories under their administration. The Special Committee took note of the conditions prevailing in the Territories and calls upon the administering Powers to undertake specific measures with regard to each Territory. It also calls upon the administering Powers to continue to take all measures to counter problems related to drug trafficking, money laundering and other criminal offences.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa22">With regard to Tokelau, the Special Committee noted the firm commitment of the Territory to the development of self-government and to an act of self-determination and, in this regard, noted the inauguration in 1999 of a national Government based on village elections by universal adult suffrage. It commends Tokelau for its ongoing work in charting a distinctive, constitutional course which reflects its unique traditions and environment. It notes with appreciation the continuing exemplary cooperation of the administering Power, New Zealand, in the work of the Special Committee, and in particular, its readiness to permit access of visiting missions to the Territory.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa23">Before concluding, I would like to extend our appreciation to the Secretariat teams of both Ms. Maria Maldonado from the Department of Political Affairs and Mr. Mohammad Sattar of the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services for their most professional assistance to the Special Committee throughout the year, which has enabled us to carry out our programme of work promptly and efficiently.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa24">In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the Special Committee has benefited greatly from the active participation of representatives of territorial Governments, regional intergovernmental bodies and non-governmental organizations, as well as experts and representatives of some administering Powers, in the work of the Special Committee. The contributions made by these individuals have provided invaluable information and insights, and their observations and recommendations have inevitably and properly been reflected in many of the Special Committee's recommendations to the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa25">Only one year remains before the end of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. A lot of work still awaits all States Members of the United Nations and the international community at large to achieve the noble objectives of the Decade. The Special Committee looks forward to working closely with all administering Powers and the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to ascertain the wishes of the people, on the basis of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. The Committee is committed to ensuring that the last year of the Decade is productive and puts into place a framework for future progress.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Papua New Guinea to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.50.pdf" class="pdf">A/54/L.50</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Donigi</span> <span class="nation">Papua New Guinea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">I am honoured to address the General Assembly on the occasion of the consideration of the question of the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. This is the first time I address the Assembly in my capacity as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It has certainly been a privilege for Papua New Guinea to have been honoured with the important responsibility of chairing the Special Committee at this important time in the work of the United Nations on decolonization.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">The Rapporteur of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples has just introduced the Committee's report, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/54/23</a>, on its work during the current year. The recommendations put forward by the Committee for the Assembly's approval have been the subject of a great deal of discussion and dialogue in the Committee, with the administering Powers and other concerned members, as well as with the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">The 1999 session of the Special Committee has seen progress in the critical review the Committee has carried out in order to improve its effectiveness in discharging the mandate the General Assembly entrusted to it. In this regard, the Committee considers that the cooperation of the administering Powers is essential to the implementation of the 1960 Declaration and other United Nations resolutions on decolonization. The Committee has therefore sought to strengthen the mechanisms for consultation and dialogue with the administering Powers. Thus, the Committee succeeded this year in setting up guidelines, albeit informal, for consultations with the administering Powers and endeavoured to lay down a conceptual framework for its future work.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The informal consultations thus far held with the administering Powers have been encouraging and point to the possibility of establishing closer and purposeful cooperation in the coming months. In addition, the Committee will certainly continue to invite the participation of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, as it has in the past.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">I turn now to the draft resolution on the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to introduce the text, as contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.50.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/L.50</a>. I am speaking on behalf of the sponsors of the draft resolution. The following countries have also co-sponsored the draft resolution: Chile, Indonesia, Iraq, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">The draft resolution before the Assembly reiterates the principles guiding the work of the United Nations on decolonization and lay down the main responsibilities of the Committee in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">By its operative part, the draft resolution reaffirms General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and all other resolutions on decolonization, including <a href="../pdf/A-RES-43-47.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 43/47</a>, which declared the decade that began in 1990 the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, and calls upon the administering Powers, in accordance with those resolutions, to take all necessary steps to enable the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories concerned to exercise fully as soon as possible their right to self-determination, including independence.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">By adopting this draft resolution, the Assembly would take note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the plan of action of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. It would also approve the report of the Special Committee covering its work during 1999 and including its programme of work envisaged for the year 2000. In this regard, by the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would request the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means for the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and to carry out those actions approved by the Assembly regarding the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. In particular, the Special Committee would be asked to continue to formulate specific proposals to bring an end to colonialism and to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">The Special Committee is also expected to continue to pay special attention to the small Territories, including through the dispatch of visiting missions, and to recommend to the General Assembly the most suitable steps to be taken to enable the populations of those Territories to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. The Special Committee is also asked to develop a constructive programme of work on a case-by-case basis for the Non-Self-Governing Territories before the end of the year 2000 to facilitate the implementation of the Committee's mandate and the relevant United Nations resolutions, including resolutions on specific Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa10">The draft resolution also calls upon the administering Powers that have not participated formally in the work of the Special Committee to do so at its session in the year 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa11">Operative paragraph 10 of the draft resolution is a result of dialogue with all interested parties and calls on administering Powers to ensure that all economic activities in the Territories concerned do not adversely affect the interests of the peoples but instead promote development and assist these peoples in the exercise of their right to self-determination.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa12">Operative paragraph 11 calls on the administering Powers to take effective measures to safeguard and guarantee the inalienable rights of the peoples of the Territories to their natural resources. The sponsors have included land as a natural resource in this operative paragraph because the Special Committee has been informed of a desire by petitioners from one particular Territory that all unused and excess land not required for military purposes be returned to the original landowners.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa13">The draft resolution borrows language from the draft decision on military activities in operative paragraph 12. This is considered a positive step to stress that military activities should not run counter to the rights and interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, especially their right to self-determination, including independence. It calls upon the administering Powers concerned to eliminate the remaining military bases in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa14">The draft resolution also requests the Secretary-General, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to provide economic, social and other assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa15">Lastly, it requests the Secretary-General to provide the Special Committee with the facilities and services it requires to carry out its mandate as it implements resolutions and decisions on decolonization adopted by the General Assembly and the Special Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa16">In presenting this draft resolution to the General Assembly, I should like to emphasize that the sponsors made every effort to take into account the views of other Member States, including the views and written suggestions submitted by the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa17">The delegations sponsoring the draft resolution welcome the European Union's initiative to participate in consultations and dialogue on decolonization issues. In fact, the transparency and spirit of cooperation prevailing in our consultations augur well for continuing and constructive dialogue in future.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa18">Before concluding, I should like to underscore several matters. First, 1999 has seen continued cooperation between the delegation of New Zealand as an administering Power and Portugal in the formal work of the Committee. Their participation has contributed in some measure in the progress in informal discussions between the Committee and the administering Powers.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa19">Secondly, I should also acknowledge that France, as an administering Power in New Caledonia, has also cooperated informally and has this year invited on a bilateral basis a ministerial mission from the Forum island States and some representatives of the Pacific States present here in New York to visit New Caledonia. I was honoured to lead the delegation from New York. The report of our delegation will be made available to Member States in due course.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa20">Thirdly, as guidelines for future informal dialogue between administering Powers and the members of the Special Committee have been agreed to, it is hoped that progress can be made in the development of a programme of work for each Non-Self-Governing Territory before the end of the year 2000. This is important, as the Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism will end next year, and a new set of mandates should be developed for these Territories for the year 2001 and beyond.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa21">Lastly, during 1999 the Special Committee has continued to receive the facilities and services it has required for its work, including substantive and technical support from the Secretariat. I should like, in this regard, to express to the Secretary-General, on behalf of the Special Committee, our sincere appreciation for and satisfaction with the arrangements made to assist the Special Committee in the discharge of its mandate. It is essential that such services and facilities continue to be provided for the smooth functioning of the Special Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa22">In concluding, I should like to ask all Member States to consider positively the recommendations contained in the present draft resolution on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples as an expression of support to the principled efforts of the United Nations to put an end to colonialism in all its forms and manifestations in an effective, speedy and unconditional manner.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa23">I commend the draft resolution to the Assembly.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lewis</span> <span class="nation">Antigua and Barbuda</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to address the General Assembly on the issue of the decolonization of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, a matter of particular interest to the 14 member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">As we come to the close of this penultimate year of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, declared by the General Assembly in its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-43-47.pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 43/47</a> of 22 November 1988, and its companion <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/181</a> of 19 December 1991, which approved a plan of action for the period, it is useful to review the implementation of the provisions of the Decade as a way of gauging the success of this initiative and of determining the strategies for the international community in the years ahead. Unfortunately, the level of implementation of the plan of action of the Decade leaves a great deal to be desired. Major provisions have yet to be addressed. Priority actions, such as the creation of political education to heighten the awareness of the peoples of the Territories, as well as visits to each of the Territories by the Secretary-General or his special representative, have never materialized.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The two critical analyses to have been completed pursuant to the plan of action, on the constitutional, political and economic development of the Territories, have essentially been ignored. This is reportedly due to the unavailability of resources and necessary expertise to carry out this crucial exercise. It is important to recall that significant reductions in human and financial resources available to the Special Committee of 24 were made at the precise time when the provisions of the plan of action were to have begun to take effect.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">In this connection, CARICOM reiterates its long-standing view that these studies and analyses called for in the plan of action are vital to a systematic and complete assessment on the part of the international community of the prevailing economic, political and social conditions in all of the Non-Self-Governing Territories as they progress towards a full measure of self-government. The importance of this comprehensive approach, based on the long-standing principles of political equality, remains critical. Thus, while we regard as somewhat useful the strategy envisaged in the draft resolution on the implementation of the decolonization Declaration, calling for a case-by-case examination of one or two Territories arbitrarily selected, we do not consider this method in any way a substitute for the full examination of the remaining Territories that would be completed in the studies and analyses contained in the plan of action. These studies and other elements of the plan of action should be undertaken as a matter of urgency, and the resources required to do this work should be identified. Significantly higher levels of resources than what are required for these studies have historically been made available in furtherance of the self-determination process of other Territories. No less attention should be devoted to the small island Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">A cursory review of the political and constitutional development of the remaining -- mostly small island -- Non-Self-Governing Territories, makes it evident that none of them have met the essential criteria of full and absolute political equality, as defined by the General Assembly in its landmark resolutions. These principles of political equality must remain the operative standard to be applied to the self-determination process of the remaining small island Non-Self-Governing Territories. This is essential in order to avoid the inadvertent legitimization by the international community of unequal, politically dependent arrangements that still characterize the present political status of these Territories. It does not appear that full self-government in any of these Territories will be attained by the end of the year 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Related to the unfinished critical activities of the plan of action is the slow pace of implementation of decolonization resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. Requested reports recommending the most suitable steps to be taken to enable the populations of those Territories to exercise their right to self-determination have not been adequately completed. Similarly, sufficient action has not been taken on other initiatives that were to have focused on political education, natural resource management, the preparation and conduct of political status referendums and other measures identified by the General Assembly and the peoples concerned as vital to the interests of the self-determination process.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">While there has been remarkable success in decolonizing over 80 territories since the Second World War, it is clear that the job remains incomplete, and the attainment of full self-government through internationally recognized processes of self-determination remains the unfinished business of the United Nations. It is evident that the efforts made thus far in this decade with respect to the small island Territories has not been sufficient. Yet United Nations regional seminars on decolonization held in the CARICOM States of Grenada in 1992, in Trinidad and Tobago in 1995, in Antigua and Barbuda in 1997 and in Saint Lucia in 1999, along with similar sessions in Fiji and Papua New Guinea in the Pacific, have provided us with important recommendations from the peoples of the Territories themselves to accelerate the decolonization process. Had these suggestions been heeded, it is likely that a much more favourable picture could be presented today.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">In order to regain the momentum necessary to address the self-determination needs and aspirations of the people of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, CARICOM, as part of its contribution to the Millennium Assembly, will propose a comprehensive plan of action for a second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. This will serve to complete the work left undone in the first such Decade, and to honour the political commitment enshrined in the United Nations Charter, to ensure the successful completion of decolonization of the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories. The recommendations of the regional seminars will be integrated into this new plan.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">One positive development of this Decade has been the convening of a series of regional seminars, alternating between the Caribbean and Pacific. These seminars are designed to assess the situation from a regional perspective by hearing the widest possible views on the various political alternatives available to the Territories. We in the Caribbean are of the view that this regional approach remains the best way to ascertain the unique self-determination needs of the small island Territories, and we remain committed to this regional seminar format. The 1999 Caribbean Regional Seminar, held in Saint Lucia last May, was especially valuable for the insights which were gained from representatives of territorial governments and regional experts on the envisaged role of the United Nations in their decolonization process into the new century. We are pleased to note that the adoption of the Saint Lucia seminar report marked the first time since the seminars convened in 1990 that the recommendations were sent to the General Assembly for consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">The momentum generated by the Saint Lucia seminar was critical for the inclusion of updated language in the omnibus draft resolution on the small Territories under consideration today, and it has successfully moved the process forward from previous years in which the General Assembly had repeatedly adopted virtually identical texts which did not take into account any new developments affecting the Territories. The draft resolution on the small Territories offers flexible and innovative solutions to addressing the decolonization issue, and our concentration should now be focused on finding effective means of implementing these recommendations. Similar new language in the draft resolution on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies also recognizes new developments, especially in the area of the participation of many of these Territories in the wider United Nations system. This should be equally encouraged.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">CARICOM regards the issue of the self-determination of the Non-Self-Governing Territories as the unfinished business of the United Nations, requiring new and innovative solutions to enhance their political, economic and social development. Many countries have successfully emerged from an internationally recognized decolonization process through the attainment of those legitimate political status options which provide political equality. The international community cannot accept anything short of this goal for the remaining Territories simply because they may be small in size.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">CARICOM has a special interest in the successful self-determination process of the small island Territories in the Caribbean and regards them as integral components of the economic, political and social fabric of our region. A successful process leading towards their self-determination is quite naturally one of our regional priorities. In this vein, CARICOM pledges its full support to efforts in furthering the successful emergence of these Territories to full political and constitutional maturity. But it is only with the full support of the international community that this process can be successfully and expeditiously completed.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dausá Céspedes</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">The achievements of the United Nations in the sphere of decolonization have been significant since the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and peoples was adopted in 1960. Without a doubt, the decolonization process has been one of the greatest victories of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">However, much remains to be done in the area of decolonization, and it would seem that we have lost the momentum of the 1960s and 1970s, when dozens of Territories under colonial rule achieved their independence. On the eve of the twenty-first century, the goal of a world without colonialism will have to wait a little longer.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The list of colonial Territories has remained unchanged for quite a few years. In a world in which it is claimed that we have moved from confrontation to cooperation, how can it be justified that there are still people suffering from the horrors of colonialism and there are still some administering Powers that continue to refuse to cooperate in the work of decolonizing undertaken by the United Nations and the bodies set up to that end?</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Cuba deems unacceptable and discriminatory the arguments put forward by some that the size of a given Territory or the number of its inhabitants must be borne in mind when considering independence. The inalienable right to self-determination and independence for peoples under colonial rule must be respected by all, regardless of the size of a given Territory, its geographic location, the number of its inhabitants or the abundance of its natural resources.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">The Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism is almost over, and the challenges in the decolonization process, far from having diminished, have grown and become more complex.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">Despite the repeated appeals of the Special Committee and the General Assembly, some administering Powers still do not submit the required information on Territories under their control on time, as clearly stipulated in Article 73 of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">The case of the visiting missions is also well known. With some exceptions that we must acknowledge, the cooperation of some of the administering Powers is far from satisfactory. These missions, as has been emphasized on several occasions, are a wonderful opportunity for obtaining first-hand information on the real situation in Non-Self-Governing Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">The peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories have legitimate right to benefit from and to use their natural resources. In accordance with resolution 2621 (XXV), we call once again on the administering Powers to take the relevant legislative or administrative measures to put an end to activities of companies under their jurisdiction that irrationally exploit the natural resources of Territories they administer. Moreover, we reiterate our concern at the military activities carried out by some administering Powers in Territories under their administration that run counter to the rights and interests of the people affected. The military bases and installations in the Non-Self-Governing Territories are a clear impediment to the enjoyment of the right to self-determination of peoples and must be eliminated. Similarly, we are strongly opposed to any attempt to use Non-Self-Governing territories for carrying out nuclear tests, stockpiling radioactive or toxic waste or housing weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">The limited development possibilities of Non-Self-Governing Territories call for ongoing cooperation and assistance from the specialized agencies and other bodies of the United Nations system. Despite the efforts of the United Nations Development Programme, resources continue to be insufficient and the coordination of the various institutions of the system is still not as effective as it could be.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">It is unacceptable that some are still determined to deny the right to independence and claim that it is only the right to self-determination that matters, as if the right to self-determination could be taken separately from the exercise of independence. It is also unacceptable that some wish to distort the right to self-determination with new wording or simply by changing the names of Territories under their rule.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa11">While it is promising that in recent months the administering Powers, in particular some that had not been doing so before, have maintained an informal dialogue with the Special Committee, we are concerned with the reluctance to consolidate this dialogue and to make it official.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa12">Once again, Cuba reaffirms its commitment to the independence and self-determination of the sister Republic of Puerto Rico, which has suffered under the yoke of colonialism for more than 100 years and yet has not lost one iota of its identity as a Latin American and Caribbean nation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa13">The colonial Power resorts to all kinds of manoeuvring to mislead international public opinion and to distort the economic, political and social reality of Puerto Rico. Yet there is only one truth: Puerto Rico is still denied its legitimate right to self-determination and its right to be a sovereign and independent nation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa14">The recent incidents in Vieques and the decisions taken by the United States Government regarding the United States military presence on the island leave not a shadow of a doubt. Despite the national consensus in Puerto Rico demanding the withdrawal of the military forces from Vieques, the colonial mandate has once again been exercised against the will of the Puerto Rican people.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa15">While we cannot say that no progress has been achieved recently, unfortunately, the results are far from what we had hoped for and, most importantly, far from what the people living under colonial rule had hoped for: to be able to exercise their right to freedom, to sovereignty and to independence. The draft resolution before us, of which my delegation will vote in favour, attempts to reflect that desire and the hope that sooner rather than later the scourge of colonialism with all the ills it brings in its wake, will disappear from the world.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa16">In closing, allow me to emphasize our conviction that the magnitude of the work that we have yet to do in the decolonization process should not lead us to inaction or pessimism. On the contrary, an objective, transparent and respectful exchange on our achievements, and especially on our difficulties, will be the first step towards a world without colonialism. In this task, as always, the Assembly can count on the full support of the delegation of Cuba.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Naidu</span> <span class="nation">Fiji</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I am pleased to announce on behalf of the following members of the South Pacific Forum -- Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu -- that they all support the draft resolution before the Assembly on this item.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">All the countries of the South Pacific Forum, including Australia and New Zealand, have been colonies, possessions or territories of other nations. Accordingly, together we have a singular concern for the remaining Territories that have not exercised their right to self-determination in the Pacific subregion. Our concept of the right of self-determination is one that is based on the realities of survival in a world that nature has carved out and shaped for us. For many centuries, our ancestors have managed to survive the scourge of natural disasters, but have also benefited from the bounties of the ocean that surrounds us. Ours is an oceanic continent. While many members recognize substantial land resources as a means of survival, ours is very much dependent on the ocean.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">The remaining five Territories in the Pacific are American Samoa, Guam, New Caledonia, Pitcairn and Tokelau. With the exception of New Caledonia, these are small islands in the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. The problems of these Territories are much the same as those recently discussed during the General Assembly's special session on small island developing States.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">We in the Pacific are particularly concerned that the rights of the people in these Territories may be overshadowed by the global goals and aspirations of nations jostling for prominence and/or a foothold in the geopolitics of today. The concerns about what sort of political structure is best suited for the people of these Pacific territories can best be dealt with by taking into account the traditional systems of government that served these people for many thousands of years before the arrival of outsiders on the scene.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">We do recognize, however, that there may be a need for change to introduce better and more efficient systems of government, new technology and better skills to manage the environment for the benefit of the people of those Territories. We believe that without the agreement and cooperation of all interested parties, the desired outcome cannot effectively be brought about. Accordingly, although many of our members have voted in favour of draft resolutions under this agenda item in the past, we have always been sceptical about the usefulness of discontent and lack of dialogue between some administering Powers, on the one hand, and the members of the Special Committee on Decolonization, on the other.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">We have now noted that there is some progress, albeit informal, in the relations between the Special Committee and those administering Powers. This appears to be reflected in the text of the draft resolution introduced by the Chairman of the Special Committee, Ambassador Donigi of Papua New Guinea. We believe this is in part due to the untiring efforts of some members of the Special Committee to improve relations with the administering Powers and, in turn, to the efforts of some administering Powers to cooperate with the Committee. We commend those members and administering Powers, and especially the Chairman, for this slight glimmer of hope. We would therefore urge other administering Powers to cooperate fully with the Special Committee to develop a programme of work for each of the Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">It is acknowledged that all Non-Self-Governing Territories are at different stages of development. Some have gross domestic products that are higher than those of some Member States of the United Nations, while some others are very poor and underdeveloped. The process of developing a programme of work for each Territory recognizes the uniqueness of each one and is an appropriate way of dealing both with their developmental issues and their right to self-determination. We support this process because we believe that it is only through it that we can establish a framework for efficiency, accountability and good governance in this area of the work of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">We note that the draft resolution mentions visiting missions. We believe that visiting missions should be considered only if they are absolutely necessary for the Committee to implement its mandate. We therefore urge both the administering Powers and the Special Committee to give serious consideration to the need for visiting missions during their consultation process towards developing a programme of work for each Territory concerned. If there is a need for the missions, then the programme of work should include a visiting mission as an activity in respect of that particular Territory. That activity can then be properly evaluated and funded at an appropriate time.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">On New Caledonia, I wish to inform representatives that at the recent South Pacific Forum heads of Government meeting in the Republic of Palau, the heads of Government welcomed the signing of the Nouméa Accord between the two main political parties in New Caledonia -- the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) and the Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR) -- and the French Government in May 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">The leaders noted the report of the Forum ministerial committee, led by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of my country, The Honourable Mr. Tupeni Baba -- which visited New Caledonia from 23 to 27 August 1999, and expressed the Forum's appreciation to the Government of France and the Government of New Caledonia for facilitating the committee's visit.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa11">The South Pacific Forum further reaffirmed its support for continuing contact with all committees in New Caledonia and its recognition of the rights of the people of New Caledonia to self-determination. In this regard, the leaders agreed to a continuing future monitoring role for the ministerial committee on New Caledonia during the implementation process of the Nouméa Accord, and encouraged the Government and all parties in New Caledonia to continue to maintain their commitment in earnest in its implementation, in keeping with the intent and spirit of the Accord.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa12">The South Pacific Forum also called on its members that are willing to do so to make available training awards for the Kanak people in their own training institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa13">We note that the provision on military activities and presence has been slightly changed from its tone in previous years. In the Pacific, the administering Powers have a military presence on Guam and New Caledonia. We in the Pacific have never considered their presence to be a threat to the peace, order and good government of the Territories concerned. We have acknowledged the rapid deployment of assistance from these two bases in the many natural disasters that have afflicted many of our small nations over the years. We have not noted, nor have we received, any evidence of the use of the military activities in those two Territories to suppress the basic freedoms of the people of those Territories. We will, however, be very displeased if any of the remaining military bases are used to suppress the rights of the people of those territories, including the right to self-determination. We therefore warmly welcome the change of attitude of the Special Committee with respect to the provision dealing with military activities.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa14">I wish now to turn my attention to East Timor, which is still on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. On this subject much has been said in the Security Council and by our own ministers at the commencement of this year's General Assembly session, in September. Suffice it to say, however, that we thank the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative, Ambassador Marker, for their efforts towards the exercise of the right of the peoples of East Timor to self-determination.</p>
</div>

	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">The process in East Timor, however, could not have taken place without the cooperation and foresight of President Habibie and his then Government. We are now left with the aftermath of the ballot, which was cast in favour of independence. We thank Australia for its decisive action in helping to bring some semblance of order to East Timor and for its continued involvement. We commend New Zealand and the other countries of the region that have come forward to provide assistance in all aspects of the administration of the Territory. We note the substantial monetary contribution made to East Timor by two countries of our region, namely Australia and Japan.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">We call on the international community to provide additional assistance to the people of East Timor to rebuild their lives and nation as soon as possible, and hope that it will do so. We welcome the appointment of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello as the United Nations administrator for East Timor, and we look forward to receiving annual reports from the administrator until such time as that Territory gains self-government and nationhood.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk05-pa01">The General Assembly will now consider the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) on agenda items 86 to 92, 93 and 18, 94 and 12, 95, 96, and 18.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk05-pa02">I request the Rapporteur of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, Mr. Gualberto Rodríguez San Martín of Bolivia, to introduce in one intervention the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rodríguez San Martín</span> <span class="nation">Bolivia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa01">I have the pleasure to introduce to the General Assembly, for its consideration and approval, the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa02">These reports refer to each of the 14 items allocated to the Fourth Committee by the General Assembly. They indicate the documents which were made available for its consideration, and they contain the texts of the various resolutions and decisions on which it took action.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa03">The Special Political and Decolonization Committee considered the items on its agenda separately, with the exception of matters relating to the Non-Self-Governing Territories and related issues, on which it held one single general debate.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa04">With regard to its programme of work, the Fourth Committee held a total of 24 meetings, five fewer than originally planned, which enabled it to comply with the recommendations referring to organization, cost-effectiveness and making more effective use of conference services.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa05">As a result of its work, the Special Political and Decolonization Committee adopted 27 draft resolutions and three draft decisions, of which 13 draft resolutions and two draft decisions were adopted by consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa06">The first report, submitted under item 86, "Effects of atomic radiation", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-573.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/573</a>. Bearing in mind the harmful effects which may be caused by certain levels of radiation on human beings and the environment, the Committee assessed the quality of work and the reports of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation and its independent method of operation, which are making a significant contribution to achieving a secure radiological environment. In this context, it encouraged the Committee to continue with its work.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa07">In this connection, I would like to inform the General Assembly that I have received a letter from the Permanent Mission of the People's Republic of China informing me that it wishes to become a sponsor of the draft resolution. The Permanent Mission of Indonesia has also expressed the wish to become a sponsor. Furthermore, the Permanent Mission of Belarus has requested me to clarify a technical mistake in the report, namely that Belarus was omitted from the list of original sponsors of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa08">In this respect, the Fourth Committee adopted the draft resolution which appears in paragraph 7 of the report and recommends its adoption to the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa09">The second report, relating to agenda 87, "International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-574.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/574</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa10">The Fourth Committee welcomed the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, held in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999, and it endorsed the practical benefits and potential offered in all areas of human activity by space technology, the peaceful application of which can contribute to increasing the quality of live and to sustainable economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa11">As part of its work, the Committee decided to establish an open-ended working group which, under the chairmanship of the delegation of India, formulated two draft resolutions. The Fourth Committee recommends both draft resolutions, contained in paragraph 13 of the report, to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa12">The third report, issued as <a href="../pdf/A-54-575.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/575</a>, refers to agenda item 88, "United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East".</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa13">The Fourth Committee took note of the fact that 8 December 1999 was the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of General Assembly resolution 302 (IV), which established the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). In that context, it recognized the work UNRWA has been doing since then to improve the living conditions of Palestine refugees, and it reiterated its concern at the persistent critical financial situation of the Agency.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa14">On this subject, the Committee adopted seven draft resolutions on various aspects of the mandate of UNRWA, which appear in paragraph 22 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends to the General Assembly that it adopt these draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa15">The fourth report, referring to agenda item 89, "Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-576.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/576</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa16">The Committee considered the report of the Special Committee concerning the protection and promotion of the human rights of the Palestinian people and other Arab inhabitants of the occupied territories. On this subject it adopted five draft resolutions, to be found in paragraph 17 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends these draft resolutions to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa17">It should be noted that during the debate on items 88 and 89, the Fourth Committee welcomed the signing of the Sharm el-Sheik Memorandum between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on 4 September 1999, which established a new climate of confidence that is conducive to future negotiations, thereby providing significant momentum to the Middle East peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa18">The fifth report, relating to agenda item 90, entitled "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects", appears in <a href="../pdf/A-54-577.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/577</a>. The Fourth Committee reiterated that peacekeeping operations are an essential instrument in the strengthening of international peace and security and that, because of the multidisciplinary nature of current operations, their mandates should be subject to responsible guidelines and revitalized approaches, on the basis of the purposes and principles proclaimed by the United Nations. Under this agenda item, the Committee adopted one draft resolution, which appears in paragraph 9 of the report, and recommends that the General Assembly adopt it.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa19">The sixth report, submitted under item 91, entitled "Questions relating to information", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-578.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/578</a>. The Committee stressed the central role of public information, which helps to project a strengthened and renovated image of the United Nations and to promote proper understanding of its work. Furthermore, in the light of the rapid changes in telecommunications and the increased use of electronic technologies, it underscored the need to explore possibilities for cooperation in the spheres of information and communications so that their benefits can be shared by all the peoples of the planet.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa20">On this subject, the Committee adopted two draft resolutions and one draft decision, which were submitted to it by the Committee on Information in its report on the work of its twenty-first session. The draft resolutions are contained in paragraph 11 of the report and the draft decision in paragraph 12. The Fourth Committee recommends that the General Assembly adopt both draft resolutions and the draft decision.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa21">With regard to the items on Non-Self-Governing Territories and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, agenda items 18, 92, 93, 94 and 12, and 95, which were considered together, the General Assembly has before it several reports. The report on agenda item 92, entitled "Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-579.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/579</a>. The draft resolution on this item appears in paragraph 8 of the report, and the Fourth Committee recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa22">The report relating to agenda items 93 and 18, entitled, respectively, "Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories" and "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-580.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/580</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa23">Under these two items, the Committee adopted one draft resolution and one draft decision. The Fourth Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the draft resolution and the draft decision, which are contained in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the report, respectively.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa24">With regard to agenda items 94 and 12, entitled, respectively, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations" and "Report of the Economic and Social Council", the report of the Fourth Committee is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-581.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/581</a>. On these issues, the Committee adopted one draft resolution, which is contained in paragraph 8 of the report, and recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa25">The report relating to agenda item 95, entitled "Offers by Members States of study and training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories", has been issued under the symbol <a href="../pdf/A-54-582.pdf" class="pdf">A/54/582</a>. Paragraph 6 of that document contains the text of a draft resolution adopted by the Fourth Committee, which it recommends to the plenary General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa26">The report on agenda item 96, entitled "Question of East Timor", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-583.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/583</a>. In this connection, it should be noted that the General Assembly decided, on the recommendation of the General Committee, to consider this item directly in plenary meeting, on the understanding that bodies and individuals having an interest in the question would be heard in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee in conjunction with the consideration of the item in plenary meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa27">The report issued under item 18, entitled "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", appears in <a href="../pdf/A-54-584.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/584</a>, which contains the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to specific Territories not covered by other agenda items.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa28">In this context, the Committee adopted four draft resolutions, including a consolidated draft resolution covering 11 Territories, and one draft decision. The draft resolutions are contained in paragraph 23 of the report, and the draft decision in paragraph 24. The Fourth Committee recommends the draft resolutions and the draft decision to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa29">With regard to the situation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and related issues, the Fourth Committee considered the degree of implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, bearing in mind the fact the year 2000 marks the end of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. In this context, it recognized the important contribution of the United Nations to decolonization and reaffirmed its commitment to continue to take the necessary measures for the advent of a world free from colonialism in the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa30">I should like to stress the high level of cooperation prevailing in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, which enabled it to achieve satisfactory results and complete its work effectively and constructively. In particular, I should like to pay tribute to the work carried out by the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Sotirios Zackheos of Cyprus, which made it possible for the Fourth Committee to consider in depth all the agenda items allocated to it by the General Assembly and to make rapid and efficient progress in its work. The Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Matia Mulumba Semakula Kiwanuka of Uganda, Mr. Yury Kazhura of Belarus and Mr. Carlos Morales of Spain, with whom I had the pleasure of working, also contributed to this success. I should also like to express my appreciation for the ability and human qualities of Mr. Mohammad Sattar, the Secretary of the Committee, and the dynamic and competent team from the Secretariat that assisted him. All of them helped organize the work of the Committee and ensured that its work was carried out in an atmosphere of genuine cordiality.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk06-pa31">I have the honour to submit to the General Assembly for consideration and adoption the recommendations of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) contained in the reports to which I have referred.</p>

May I remind members that by paragraph 7 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a> the Assembly agreed that</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa03">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa04">May I also remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa05">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified to the contrary in advance.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa06">This means that where recorded votes were taken in the Committee, we will do the same. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee).</p>
