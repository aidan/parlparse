Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands have joined as sponsors of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the following revisions to be made to the text of the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1997-260.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/260</a> in its provisional form.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Qin Huasun</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The Chinese delegation is concerned about developments in Albania and hopes that tranquillity and stability will be restored in Albania as soon as possible. We therefore support the political and diplomatic efforts made by the international community towards the settlement of the Albanian question.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The question of Albania is a complex one. In essence, it is the internal affair of Albania. For the Security Council to authorize action in a country because of strife resulting from the internal affairs of that country is inconsistent with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. This matter should therefore be handled with extreme caution. Moreover, we have never been in favour of the Security Council frequently invoking Chapter VII of the Charter in authorizing such actions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">At the same time, however, with due regard for the relevant requests of the Albanian Government and for its urgent desire for the return of stability to Albania as soon as possible, the Chinese delegation will not stand in the way of the adoption of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">In our view, the ultimate settlement of the Albanian question depends on the Albanian people themselves. We look forward to the restoration of stability and calm to Albania at the earliest date.</p>
