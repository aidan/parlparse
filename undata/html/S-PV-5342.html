	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">There were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1651(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1651 (2005)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on the Council's behalf.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the commencement in Abuja, Nigeria, of the seventh round of the African Union (AU)-led inter-Sudanese peace talks on Darfur, and expresses its appreciation to the African Union, the international community and the other donors.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council is encouraged by the active participation of representatives from all invited groups of the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), as well as members of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, as part of the Government of National Unity, and urge their continued cooperation with the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) and with the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council calls on all parties to the conflict to fulfil their commitments to conclude a just and full peace accord without further delay. The Security Council demands that all parties refrain from violence and put an end to atrocities on the ground, especially those committed against civilians, including women and children, humanitarian workers and international peacekeepers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council recalls the demands on the Government of the Sudan and the rebel forces, as well as other armed groups, to respect fully their commitments referred to in its recent resolutions. The Council demands, in particular, that the SLM/A, the JEM and the Government of the Sudan immediately cease violence, comply with the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement, end impediments to the peace process and cooperate fully with the African Union Mission, and that the Government of the Sudan disarm and control militias. It further demands that those responsible for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law be brought to justice without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council recalls its concern that the persisting violence in Darfur might further negatively affect the region, in particular the security of Chad. It firmly condemns in this context recent attacks perpetrated by armed elements within Chad and in particular the attack on 19 December 2005 on positions of the Chadian national army in the town of Adré, and supports efforts to reduce tensions on the border.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Council reaffirms its determination to make full use of existing measures under the relevant Security Council resolutions on the Sudan, including holding accountable those responsible for violence and violations of the arms embargo, and those who impede the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council expresses its gratitude to the African Union and its Mission in the Sudan for the positive role its forces have played in reducing violence and promoting the restoration of order in Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council also appeals to donors to continue both supporting the crucial work of AMIS in stemming the violence in this suffering region and providing critical humanitarian assistance to millions of war-afflicted civilians in Darfur and across the border in Chad.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"In the broader Sudan context, the Security Council welcomes further progress achieved in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in particular the signing of the Constitution for Southern Sudan and the formation of the Government of Southern Sudan."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-67.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/67</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
