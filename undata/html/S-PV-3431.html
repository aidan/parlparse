	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">His Excellency Mr. Venancio de Moura, Minister of External Relations of Angola, has asked to speak. I invite him to make his statement to the Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. de Moura</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">I am asked to express myself in an official language of the United Nations. Hence I shall try my hand at French, and I crave your customary indulgence if I make any mistakes in speaking a language I do not often use.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">I do not have a long statement to make. I am here more or less by chance because we came to take part in the work of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Since the Council decided to take up the question of Angola at this time, this prompted me to ask you, Mr. President, to accept our presence here, and we are very grateful to you for giving us this opportunity to say how much we appreciate the Council's efforts to resolve the situation in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">The Council has once again extended the mandate of the United Nations Verification Mission in Angola (UNAVEM II). We shall shortly witness the further efforts of the Council, perhaps with a view to proceeding from UNAVEM II to UNAVEM III by increasing the number of United Nations personnel in Angola. We would also like to place on record our hopes that the Lusaka talks will shortly be successful.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">I should like once again to assure the members of the Council of the readiness of the Angolan Government to do its utmost to ensure that the Lusaka talks result very soon in a lasting solution leading to the establishment of peace in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">This is also a good time to express our thanks to the Security Council for all its endeavours aimed at bringing Angolans to national reconciliation. We would like to state that, despite the delays that have occurred on the part of our brothers in UNITA, they have, on 5 September last, finally accepted the package proposed through mediation, in accordance with which UNITA elements would participate in the central, provincial and local governments on a basis which is well known to the Council. There may perhaps be some outstanding issues on the Lusaka agenda, but if political will prevails on both sides, particularly on the UNITA side, I think we shall soon be successful.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">Once again, I wish to express my delegation's readiness to work in Lusaka to ensure that the talks are successfully completed and that we may shortly proceed to implementation, which will require all of us, and the international community in particular, to provide the material support, human resources and all that is necessary to ensure that lasting peace is restored to Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">That is the brief statement I wished to make, and I thank you, Mr. President, for your kindness in allowing me to speak.</p>
