	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now resume its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General of 24 March 2000 on developments in Guinea-Bissau (<a href="../pdf/S-2000-250.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/250</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council pays tribute to the people of Guinea-Bissau for the success of the transitional process which has led to the organization of free, fair and transparent elections. It congratulates the Representative of the Secretary-General, the staff of the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNOGBIS) and the Members of the United Nations for all they have done to assist the people of Guinea-Bissau in this task. The Council also thanks the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP), Member States which contributed to the trust fund established to support the activities of UNOGBIS and the Friends of the Secretary-General for Guinea-Bissau for their contributions to consolidating peace and stability in Guinea-Bissau.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the swearing in of President Kumba Yala on 17 February 2000 and the return to constitutional and democratic order in Guinea-Bissau following the holding of free and fair presidential and legislative elections. The Council affirms that all concerned, particularly the former military junta, elections, as part of the Abuja Accord (<a href="../pdf/S-1998-1028.pdf" class="pdf">S/1998/1028</a>, annex).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council encourages all concerned in Guinea-Bissau to work together closely in a spirit of tolerance to strengthen democratic values, to protect the rule of law, to depoliticize the army and to safeguard human rights. The Council supports the efforts made by the Government of Guinea-Bissau to redefine the role of the military in Guinea-Bissau in accordance with the rule of law and democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its support for the newly elected Government of Guinea-Bissau and encourages the new authorities to develop and to implement programmes devised to consolidate peace and national reconciliation. The Council calls on the international community to support the Government's three-month transitional programme, pending the organization of a new round-table conference. The Council agrees with the comment made by the Secretary-General, in paragraph 24 of his report, to the effect that sustained support of the international community is crucial for the consolidation of the progress achieved so far, and for helping Guinea-Bissau lay a durable foundation for a better life for its people."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2000-11.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2000/11</a>.</p>
