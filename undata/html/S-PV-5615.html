	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">On behalf of the Council, I welcome the new members: Belgium, Indonesia, Italy, Panama and South Africa.

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">On behalf of the members of the Security Council, I should like to welcome the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who is taking part in a formal meeting of the Council for the first time in his new capacity. Let me express the hope that the Council will establish the closest and most productive cooperation with the new Secretary-General in carrying out its primary responsibility for strengthening international peace, security and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">We should support the Secretary-General's already expressed intention to jointly find ways to resolve current international problems through the collective efforts of all States Members of this universal Organization. We cannot fail to agree with Mr. Ban that no single individual, including the Secretary-General himself, nor any single State, even with the most abundant resources and power, can resolve those problems. Their resolution can be achieved only by strengthening multilateral cooperation and enhancing the role and the effectiveness of United Nations activities, including the activities of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I should like to take this opportunity to express gratitude and pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan, who carried out his duties as Secretary-General over the course of many years in a dignified manner.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Thank you very much, Mr. President, for those kind words. I am honoured to be here, and I thank the President of the Security Council, His Excellency Ambassador Churkin, for this opportunity to meet with the members of the Council in this historic Chamber.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">As this is my first meeting with you, let me pay tribute to all Council members and extend, in this new year, my best wishes to all of you for a most successful 2007. In particular, let me acknowledge the presence of the new members, namely, Belgium, Indonesia, Italy, Panama and South Africa, which joined the Council at the same time as I joined the Organization. We have much to learn together.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Allow me to assure all of you of my deep sense of mission, duty and dedication as I assume this high office. You know, perhaps better than anyone else, that I do so at a daunting time in world affairs. The international community faces a range of challenges, from Darfur to the Middle East, and other crises that trouble our world, from defending human rights to the need to move forward in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">I look forward to working closely with the Security Council to ensure that the Organization lives up to the considerable expectations that the international community places on us. As the Council considers the perspectives of the Member States on threats to international peace and security, I am here to listen to all of you.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lacroix</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa01">I should like at the outset, on behalf of the French delegation, to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council and to thank the Ambassador of Qatar and his delegation for their conduct of the presidency last month. My delegation would also like to welcome the new members of the Council and to thank those States that left the Council at the end of last year. Finally, I wish to welcome the presence of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and to congratulate him once again on his assumption of his current duties. He can always count on France's full support as he carries out his weighty and demanding, yet exciting, responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa02">My delegation would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having organized today's meeting. It is indeed crucial that the Council be able to begin this dialogue with the Secretary-General so that we can address together the considerable challenges facing the Organization today in the area of peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa03">Those challenges are increasingly diverse and complex. Armed conflicts continue to persist in parts of the world -- in particular on the African continent, with the crises in Côte d'Ivoire, Darfur and Somalia. The crises affecting the Middle East are a major source of concern. To that must be added new threats, beginning with terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa04">The responsibility of the Council is to respond effectively and efficiently to each of those threats. The Council, and through it the United Nations, is increasingly being called upon. The deployment of more than 80,000 Blue Helmets throughout the world and the prospects of new operations -- in the Sudan and Nepal, for instance -- illustrate that point. How are we to meet those challenges?</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa05">First, we must work together, in unity. In the face of threats that go beyond borders, security will be achieved only through a collective effort. That entails two things. We must have a common view of the challenges to be overcome and of the solutions to be deployed. We must also continue to strengthen cooperation between the Council, the Secretary-General and regional organizations. Those joint efforts are prerequisites to our effectiveness.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa06">In addition, the Council must be more able than it is today to prevent crises. That means that the United Nations must have an enhanced conflict-prevention capacity, that the Secretary-General must be able to alert the Council as quickly as possible as to possible risks of destabilization and that, lastly, we must be able to define comprehensive prevention strategies.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa07">Furthermore, we must pay close attention to the management of the post-conflict period. The Peacebuilding Commission must of course play its role fully in that regard, as it has already begun to do with regard to Burundi and Sierra Leone. The Council must evaluate its efforts, consider as needed ways to increase effectiveness and take into account in its future efforts recommendations to be made by the Commission. Lastly, the Council must continue to consider, in close cooperation with the Secretary-General, ways to perfect the instruments at its disposal.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa08">First, with regard to the maintenance of peace, the stakes are well known, namely, proper management of resources, more effective support for transitional processes, better coordination between protagonists, and special attention to the political process -- which must necessarily be the basis for peacekeeping operations. That must be followed by the implementation of sanctions and other binding measures decided upon by the Council, in connection with which the Council has recently taken a number of important decisions. The Council must continue along that path in order to ensure the full implementation of such measures, as well as the effectiveness and transparency of its procedures.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa09">Those are several avenues for action that we should pursue together. We must also not forget that peace and security also entail combating poverty, pandemics and corruption, as well as protecting human rights and fighting impunity. For justice is a precondition for peace. In that regard, the International Criminal Court will be an essential tool in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa10">The challenges we must overcome are daunting. Unfortunately, the work before us continues to be enormous. Thus we must continue our joint efforts to further improve the effectiveness of our actions. That is incumbent upon us all, as is the responsibility to protect.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Bader</span> <span class="nation">Qatar</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month, as well as for calling this meeting on an important item to debate the basic tasks of the Security Council. I also wish to thank you for your efforts to prepare the draft presidential statement and to preside over the negotiations on it.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">We also wish to welcome Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, who is participating officially in a meeting of the Security Council for the first time as Secretary-General. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment. I wish him every success in discharging the tasks entrusted to him by the Charter and in contributing effectively, through his unique position, to international efforts designed to uproot the numerous evils that threaten international peace and security and the welfare of peoples. We are confident that his experience, wisdom and skill will lead to the attainment of the goals to which we aspire.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">We are also pleased at the enthusiasm Mr. Ban has demonstrated in leading the international Organization. We shall be quite prepared, through our membership of the Security Council, to cooperate with him as regards the matters before the Council. Effective cooperation between the Council and the Secretary-General is a sine qua non for the success of our work. In the efforts to maintain international peace and security, there must be concerted action between the Secretary-General and the Secretariat, on the one hand, and between the Security Council and the other bodies of the United Nations, on the other hand.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">Given that under the Charter of the United Nations, which established the Security Council, the Council's basic responsibility is to maintain international peace and security, it is fitting that the Council should comprehensively address threats to international peace and security. This is an opportunity to underscore the Council's efforts to deal with such threats. It is also an opportunity to examine new threats, for the changing world is subject to unpredictable threats. The Council accorded this issue the attention it deserves when it convened a high-level meeting in September 2005 to take up the matter at the level of heads of Government.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">The concept of security has evolved over the years and become more comprehensive, broadening to include issues such as collective security and others that were overlooked by established concepts pertaining to armed conflict. Wars are not the only thing that threatens people's security. We should do our best to prevent conflict and to make peace. All United Nations bodies should work together to achieve that goal, and the Council should cooperate with other organs to achieve that objective. According to the Charter of the United Nations, the main task of the Security Council is the maintenance of international peace and security. That should be in line with the principles enshrined in the Charter regarding the maintenance and development of peaceful relations between States and the prevention of conflict. The Council has a great responsibility in that connection.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">We cannot deny the complementary link between development and peace, on the one hand, and human rights, on the other. In fact, the United Nations cannot confine itself to the maintenance of international peace and security; it should also focus on socio-economic development and the protection of human rights. None of those goals can be achieved in isolation from the others. The establishment last year of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council illustrated the interest of the international community in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">New challenges have emerged recently in the area of threats to international peace and security, including the threat of terrorism. The international community must stand against such scourges, including the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction, whose proliferation we must do our best to prevent. We come from a region that has been plagued by conflict for a long time. We look to the Security Council and the Secretary-General to achieve just and lasting peace and development in our region.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">In conclusion, we once again wish every success to the Secretary-General and his aides, and reiterate our support for and cooperation with the Organization and him.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mantovani</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Let me first convey to you, Sir, our warmest congratulations on your assumption of the Council presidency, as well as my warmest thanks to Qatar for presiding over the Council in December.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">It is indeed a great privilege for me to take the floor as the representative of Italy at this first public debate of the Council in 2007 to address the core function of the Security Council. I wish therefore to thank you, Sir, at this first debate under your presidency, for convening this meeting. I also wish to take this opportunity to express my warmest welcome to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, to whom Italy wishes all the best in his future endeavours.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">I will confine myself to making a few remarks on some relevant issues.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">As to conflict prevention, the Security Council has an important responsibility to play in that field, together with all the other bodies of the United Nations, first and foremost the General Assembly, and with all other actors that operate on various levels to prevent the outbreak of new conflicts, be they States, international organizations, non-governmental organizations or civil society representatives. In that framework, we think that the Secretariat should enhance its essential role in presenting the Council with analyses of possible new crisis situations and we urge from it the greatest possible cooperation in that field.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">With regard to peacekeeping, Italy believes that the Security Council's operative decisions should also give adequate consideration to the views of countries which, while not members of the Council, provide human, technical and financial resources to United Nations missions. Actually, our view is that there is a strong need for more regular interaction between the Security Council, the troop-contributing countries and the General Assembly bodies that have a voice in peacekeeping operations, as well as the Secretariat, whose crucial role is to ensure that the conduct of peacekeeping operations matches effectively the purposes for which they are established. Based on its renewed participation in United Nations-led missions, Italy will continue to work in close coordination with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Lastly, we believe that the United Nations essential role in peacekeeping should be enhanced through closer cooperation with regional and subregional organizations, such as the African Union, the European Union, the Organization of American States, the Economic Community of West African States, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Pacific Islands Forum and others, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter. Being a strong believer in the values of the European Union, Italy will strive to ensure that the European political and military mechanisms interact ever more closely with the Secretariat, in compliance with the Joint Declaration on United Nations-European Union Cooperation in Crisis Management, adopted in September 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">On peacebuilding, the general membership and civil society have great expectations for the Peacebuilding Commission's role in stabilizing countries emerging from conflicts. In our view, it is crucial that not only the Commission, but also the entire United Nations system, focus their strategy to meet those expectations. A better definition of its core issues, a task-oriented agenda, a closer partnership with relevant countries, and the more active involvement of all stakeholders are, in our view, the guiding principles for that crucial subsidiary organ of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Italy expects the advice of an effective and authoritative Peacebuilding Commission to be duly taken into account by the Council, by the United Nations other main bodies, and by the international financial institutions to ensure a smooth transition from conflict situation to sustainable peace and development.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">With respect to terrorism, in recent years the Security Council has adopted a series of measures to safeguard international security, which Italy strongly supports. Last September, the whole membership approved the first Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We believe that the action of the Security Council and its subsidiary bodies cannot be separated, in that field, from the action that other United Nations bodies perform in fulfilment of their respective mandates.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">Italy intends to provide constructive inputs to the Security Council's action in its fight against international terrorism, working to ensure that this challenge be perceived as a common endeavour of the international community as a whole. We are confident that coordination among the various initiatives already under way in the fight against international terrorism shall be pursued effectively in the framework of the Global Strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">To conclude, Italy wishes to praise the Security Council's primary role and essential, irreplaceable action for the maintenance of international peace and security. As members know, we also strongly believe that effective, inclusive multilateralism is the best way to address the threats that are rising on the international horizon. That is why Italy seeks to further strengthen the action of the Security Council through a comprehensive reform that encompasses representativeness, transparency and efficiency, highlighting the real ownership of the decision-making process by all the Members of the United Nations family.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Burian</span> <span class="nation">Slovakia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I would like to commend the Russian presidency for its initiative in organizing today's timely and highly relevant debate.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Let me also join previous speakers in welcoming Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the first time to the Security Council this morning and thank him for his opening remarks. We very much appreciate the Secretary-General's commitment to working closely and intensively with the Security Council on all crucial issues related to the maintenance of international peace and security. I would like to assure him of Slovakia's full support for his work, his dedication to leading by example, and his eagerness to work hard in all three pillars of the United Nations portfolio -- security, human rights and development.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">We believe that the emergence of new threats to international peace and security requires the constant attention and regular adaptation of the Security Council and its working methods to the new security environment. That is particularly true for some of the most daunting challenges, such as the upsurge in terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and massive intra-State conflicts with the potential to destabilize entire regions, such as the crisis in Darfur. It is our joint responsibility to intensify our efforts to achieve tangible progress in our work, which should bring people more peace and security, better respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and greater prosperity. Words, statements and proclamations need to be transformed into practical measures, making a real difference on the ground. Otherwise, the entire United Nations system, including the Security Council, will lose its relevance and credibility.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">We believe that the Security Council, in addition to its usual focus on peacekeeping operations, must equally concentrate on conflict prevention and post-conflict peacebuilding, which are undoubtedly very complex and extremely challenging tasks, but crucially important ones.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">As part of the Council's preventive diplomacy, in accordance with the 2005 World Summit Outcome DOCUMENT and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1625(2005).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1625 (2005)</a>, we believe that the Council needs to do more in such areas as the protection of civilians, including women and children, in military conflicts. We must do everything to prevent another Rwanda or Srebrenica from happening again. In that regard, we fully endorse the concept of responsibility to protect adopted by our heads of State and Government in September 2005. Furthermore, we hope to be able to rely on receiving more regular and more analytical reports from the Secretary-General on regions of potential armed conflict. The good offices of the Secretary-General will certainly continue to be an indispensable tool.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">As regards post-conflict peacebuilding, it is crucial that the Council make better use of the potential and of the coordinating and advisory functions of the Peacebuilding Commission. The first results related to the situation in Burundi and Sierra Leone have been promising but fairly modest so far. Our joint efforts need to be intensified and widened. Smooth transitions from peacekeeping to the post-conflict phase ought to be addressed in a more comprehensive and more systematic way.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">In this context, I would like to highlight the issue of security sector reform as one of the crucial challenges. The re-establishment of functioning security institutions often lies at the core of many peacebuilding efforts. Neglecting or insufficiently carrying out this reform has too often had in dire consequences, including countries relapsing into violence and armed conflict. That is why Slovakia, in cooperation with other partner countries, has recently launched an initiative that will result in an open Security Council debate next month on the issue of security sector reform.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">Also among the Council's top priorities are the looming threats of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Slovakia firmly believes that the Council needs to intensify its efforts in these major areas and strive for more tangible results by implementing existing resolutions, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1718(2006).pdf" class="pdf">1718 (2006)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">1737 (2006)</a>. The Council must also seek to enhance and streamline the work of its relevant committees.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">In addition to receiving and evaluating reports from States Members of the United Nations, more needs to be done, in particular, in providing guidance and technical assistance to States in capacity-building, local and regional ownership and strengthening United Nations partnerships and cooperation with regional, subregional and other intergovernmental organizations. Efforts of regional and other stakeholders and of the United Nations must reinforce and complement one another, thereby making the best use of existing capacities and often very limited resources.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">My statement today would be incomplete without mentioning the ongoing need for comprehensive reform of the Security Council, to which Slovakia is firmly committed. Such reform must include both an increase in the Council's membership and an improvement in its working methods.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa11">Slovakia welcomes and is committed to fully implementing the outcomes of the intensive work conducted last year by its revitalized Informal Working Group on Documentation and Other Procedural Questions. As a current non-permanent Council member, Slovakia will spare no effort to help achieve further progress in the work of the Informal Working Group.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa12">Mandate review was another essential element of the World Summit's reform agenda, one that could help make the entire Organization, including this Council, more relevant, efficient and effective in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, allow me once again to reiterate my delegation's full commitment to the Security Council's intensive and close cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the entire United Nations Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa14">Finally, we would like to thank the Russian delegation for preparing the draft Presidential Statement, the adoption of which we support today.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">May I start by congratulating the Russian Federation and you personally, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Council. I would add my thanks to Qatar for its stewardship of the Council in December. I would also like to welcome the five new Council members and pay tribute to the outstanding contributions of the five members whom they have replaced.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">I also want, in particular, to welcome the new Secretary-General and assure him publicly of my Government's unstinting support for his efforts throughout his tenure.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Mr. President, it is timely that you have brought the Council together with the new Secretary-General to look ahead to the challenges and opportunities that we face. This Council has always been at the forefront of global efforts to maintain international peace and security, its essential responsibility. But the international landscape, with the consequent requirement for Council activity, has rarely seemed as complex as it does today.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">In the past year the Council played a crucial role in helping end the fighting between Israel and Lebanon. It worked continuously to try to bring peace to Darfur, and is still doing so. It responded firmly to the actions of Iran and North Korea. It continued to support African Union efforts to bring an end to the crisis in Côte d'Ivoire. It supported the first free elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 40 years.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The year ahead promises to be no less challenging. We must ensure that international efforts intensify to bring an end to suffering for the people of Darfur. We must continue to tackle the threats of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The international community needs a comprehensive Middle East strategy. We must redouble our efforts to support those who want to achieve peace rather than to perpetuate turmoil in that region. At the core of that strategy will be the question of Israel and Palestine. This meeting is an opportunity to reflect on how the Council, in partnership with the Secretary-General and the Secretariat, as well as with other United Nations organs, regional bodies and international actors, can improve its capacity to meet those challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">I want to focus now, particularly, on the conflict cycle. The maintenance of international peace and security demands, above all, more effective action to prevent conflicts from occurring and then recurring and, where they do exist, to help bring them to an end on a sustainable basis.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">So the challenges for us are how to be better at conflict prevention and resolution and at crisis management, including peacekeeping and post-conflict peacebuilding. In each of these areas, the Secretariat can, I believe, help continue to improve our collective efforts. It is important and welcome that these issues are covered concisely but cogently, and with proposals for action, in the presidential statement that we will adopt later today.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">On conflict prevention, this Council adopted a landmark resolution at its summit meeting in 2005. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1625(2005).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1625 (2005)</a> set out an ambitious vision for a more comprehensive, integrated and proactive approach to prevention. It called for more regular and analytical reporting from the Secretariat and asked the Secretary-General to help countries at risk of conflict to perform strategic conflict risk assessments. It also stressed the importance of effective conflict prevention strategies, embracing not just traditional security and political factors, but also economic, social and humanitarian factors, as well as the field of governance and human rights. The resolution constituted, in fact, a very comprehensive policy.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">Too often, the Council and the international community are witnesses to the emergence of conflict, rather than actively being involved in prevention. We see -- or we fail to see -- a crisis developing, and agree to act only when it is too late. The Council and the Secretariat must form a stronger partnership in conflict prevention, through ambitious implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1625(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1625 (2005)</a>, to ensure that we do better collectively at the early stages in anticipating and thus preventing conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">A second priority is peacekeeping. United Nations peacekeeping is ever more in demand. The surge in missions and numbers over recent years is striking. It is therefore incumbent on us to ensure the most effective use of scarce resources. An important part of this endeavour is to ensure that peacekeeping missions have clearer, more focused mandates with specific objectives to be achieved within given timeframes.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">Peacekeeping missions should form part of a wider peacebuilding strategy to achieve the progress necessary so that such missions are no longer needed. In many post-conflict situations, the risk is that peacekeeping missions become part of the landscape and allow a status quo to persist. We therefore need to focus on a coherent approach with the goal of resolving the underlying issues.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">To do this, the Council should be more strategic in assessing the underlying issues and in giving missions more purposive mandates. This approach requires from the Secretariat reporting which makes clear proposals on how United Nations missions can and should evolve and what action the countries concerned, the international community and the Council itself can take to accelerate transition from peacekeeping to self-sustaining peace.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa13">Finally, on a closely related point, we need to strengthen our collective ability to pursue post-conflict peacebuilding. Establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission was an important achievement, but it will fulfil its objectives only if it becomes an action-oriented, strategic body in which countries emerging from conflict can discuss candidly and effectively with international, regional and local actors in post-conflict peacebuilding what needs to be done and who should do it.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa14">The United Kingdom considers, therefore, that the Peacebuilding Commission needs to build on its initial activities to ensure that it can make a real difference. Its role in advising the Council is also centrally important. Our continuing involvement in Sierra Leone, Burundi and other countries that will be on the Council's agenda in future must take full account of the contributions and proposals that the Peacebuilding Commission makes.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa15">In conclusion, the Security Council plays a central role in the international community's efforts to maintain peace and security. But we cannot work in isolation, given the interdependent nature of security, development and human rights. The new Secretary-General and the Council must and will, I am sure, work in partnership with each other and with other international actors to maximize our collective ability to tackle threats, to seek opportunities and to promote the cause of peace.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Nana Effah-Apenteng</span> <span class="nation">Ghana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, may I first congratulate you and the other members of the delegation of the Russian Federation on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month and also commend you for having organized this debate on contemporary threats to international peace and security. Also, permit me once again to congratulate the new Secretary-General on his assumption of his high office and to express my delegation's appreciation for his presence here with us for the first time in the Council and for his statement. We wish him success in his new assignment.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Globalization has thrust upon the global community new and multifarious threats to international peace and security of a scope and intensity that could never have been anticipated by the founding fathers of the United Nations. In the process of trying to eliminate the traditional threats, the international community has been confronted with new, and, in some cases, more dangerous ones, which threaten our common well-being and survival.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Understandably, our immediate priority must be to deal with ongoing conflicts and imminent threats such as terrorism and all forms of extremism. We must also remain focused on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, small arms and light weapons, as well as gross abuses of human rights, including ethnic cleansing and genocide. Equally critical are the problems of global warming and the weaponization of outer space, which are serious potential threats and must be kept on our radar. Nor must we lose sight of the widening gap between the rich and poor, both within and among nations, which is bound to have a destabilizing effect on international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">In short, threats to international peace and security cannot be dealt with piecemeal through a patchwork of initiatives that merely address the symptoms without really touching on the root causes. The realities of today require that the Council pursue its mandate within a comprehensive conceptual framework of peace and security. It is through such an approach that the Security Council can provide leadership that is inspiring, effective and credible in the process of tackling the problems that threaten to compromise the survival of humankind.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Development must be an important component of our collective security system. Combating poverty and improving education and health care will save millions of lives as well as strengthen the capacity of States to combat terrorism, organized crime and prevent other threats. If development is deemed so crucial to security, then more determined and focused efforts should be made to monitor the implementation of internationally agreed goals, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We encourage the appropriate United Nations organs, departments and agencies to redouble their efforts in helping Member States to achieve those goals.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">It has long been recognized that in dealing with conflicts, more emphasis should be placed on conflict prevention. We acknowledge the substantive progress that has been made through United Nations peacekeeping operations, especially in Africa, and in laying a foundation to deal effectively with conflicts. To consolidate peace throughout Africa and in conflict-ravaged countries in other areas, it is imperative to emphasize that a coordinated, coherent and integrated approach must be taken to post-conflict peacebuilding, with a view to achieving sustainable development. We believe that this is precisely what the Peacebuilding Commission is supposed to help us achieve.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">Unquestionably, global terrorism is one of the foremost threats to international peace and security today. Terrorism, a constantly mutating phenomenon, represents an assault on the fundamental principles of law, human rights, and the peaceful settlement of disputes, on the basis of which the United Nations was founded. In accepting that terrorism cannot be justified, irrespective of the reasons behind it, we must be careful not to ignore grievances such as political oppression and alienation, which breed terrorism. For the international community to defeat terrorism and the threat it poses, we must act with unflinching determination to resolve the political disputes and long-festering conflicts which generate support for terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">We recognize that the Security Council has played a commendable role in this field through its landmark <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">1624 (2005)</a>. However, much more remains to be done in providing technical assistance to help Member States comply with those resolutions and implement the strategy that has recently been adopted by the General Assembly. Moreover, we are so close to, yet so far from, completing the cycle by concluding a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Transnational organized crime also has the potential to heighten the risks posed by all the other threats. Terrorists, for instance, use organized criminal groups to move money, men and materials around the globe. Governments and rebels sell natural resources through organized criminal groups to finance wars. In the process, the capacity of States to establish the rule of law is weakened. Combating organized crime therefore becomes essential in fighting hideous trans-border crimes such as trafficking in human beings.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">Preventing the spread and use of weapons of mass destruction by States and, more importantly, by non-State actors is imperative to ensure a more secure world. The challenge lies in taking effective measures to reduce the demand for such weapons and curb the supply of materials as well as the technology for their production. We therefore regret the failure of the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to adopt any agreement. Despite recent controversy related to the issue of nuclear proliferation, the NPT still enjoys near-universal membership, and we remain convinced of its viability and integrity as a sure way of containing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">A related issue is the threat that the proliferation of small arms poses to international peace and security. With a reported circulation of about 40 million worldwide, small arms have become the real weapons of mass destruction in many countries, especially -- paradoxically -- in Africa, where such weapons are not manufactured. We welcome the Council's efforts in encouraging Member States to fully support the recommendations contained in the Programme of Action adopted at the July 2001 United Nations Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa12">We are also encouraged by the adoption by the General Assembly in 2005 of an international instrument to identify and trace illicit small arms. However, our commitment to dealing with the threats posed by such weapons has been seriously undermined by the failure of the 2006 United Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action. Our confidence has also been shaken by the failure of the Council, despite the strenuous efforts made by some of its present members and States that were members in the immediate past, to agree on a draft resolution on this issue last year.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa13">On balance, it is evident that the Security Council has played a commendable role in dealing with both imminent and potential threats to international peace and security. But it should be noted that, despite the Council's important role in the maintenance of international peace and security, it is only one of the many organs and the wide array of international bodies and entities dealing with some aspects of the threats that have been identified. It is of cardinal importance, therefore, that, in discharging its obligations under the Charter, the Council endeavour to foster a genuine partnership with some of those entities, such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union and the European Union, which have so far proved active in this field.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa14">It behoves the Council also to look for more creative ways of actively engaging and involving in its work the wider membership of the United Nations, the non-members, which are expected to comply with its binding resolutions and decisions, including the generic legislation of the Council. Such an approach, we believe, will bring more effectiveness and success to the Council's work.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa15">Lastly, we believe that the time has come to expand the membership of the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Verbeke</span> <span class="nation">Belgium</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I should like at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this, the first month of the new year, and to assure you that you can rely on our full and effective cooperation. I would also like to pay tribute to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, our new Secretary-General. We would like to assure him that we have every confidence in him and to wish him every success as he carries out his important new responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">As we all know, over the past decade the concept of security has been expanded from one with a narrow political and military definition to one with new dimensions, each of which corresponds to new threats and challenges -- terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, grave human rights violations, organized crime, the situation of fragile States and environmental degradation. If we are to counter these threats, we need an effective multilateral system founded on solid international institutions and respect for international law. For Belgium, the United Nations, with the Security Council at its heart, plays a crucial role in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">In the context of this new concept of security it is essential that, above and beyond pre-established and often reductionist approaches, we recognize that, at the end of the day, it is the security of men, women and children that is at stake. That is why Belgium welcomes the increased attention that the Security Council is giving to the protection of civilians -- particularly that of women, children and other vulnerable groups -- in armed conflict. The relevant resolutions aimed at the protection of civilians must be effectively implemented.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">In this regard, Belgium would also like to emphasize the importance of ensuring the close monitoring and rigorous implementation of arms embargoes in conflict areas. Indeed, we all know that it is first and foremost civilians who are the victims of lack of compliance with such embargoes and, in particular, of the abuse of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">In this context, I would like to refer to the principle of the responsibility to protect, which was enshrined during the 2005 Summit and which has since been taken up in numerous resolutions. Belgium is fully aware that the operationalization of that principle will require in-depth and prudent reflection. We nonetheless believe that that principle will henceforth be part of the conceptual <i>acquis  </i>of the work of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">As we all know, terrorism represents one of the greatest threats to international peace and security. The Security Council plays a leading role in international action to combat terrorism. In this regard, Belgium welcomed the adoption by the Council of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1624 (2005)</a>. By reaffirming the importance of respect for international law, including human rights law, as well as the importance of dialogue and understanding among civilizations, it aims to prevent incitement to terrorism. That is a good example of the preventive dimension of Security Council action. In this regard, the Council could also consider how best to counteract hate speech and discourse inciting violence during periods of armed conflict, as well as before conflict breaks out or with a view to preventing the re-emergence of conflict. As we know, words can be as deadly as weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">Conflict prevention remains the main -- albeit, by definition, the less visible -- task of the Security Council as the guardian of international peace and security. Conflict management, by contrast, is its most visible task. Peacekeeping operations are the Council's instrument of choice in shouldering its responsibility in the area of international peace and security. Such operations cover a broad range of activities, from classic peacekeeping to multidimensional operations, culminating in transitional administrative missions.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The range of diverse actions undertaken by the Security Council in recent years testifies to the growing support for a more operational and more pragmatic approach to carrying out its functions. Belgium welcomes that development. At the same time, however, my country urges caution regarding the risk of the indiscriminate proliferation of such operations. Indeed, it is quite clear that not all crisis situations can be resolved in that manner. The Security Council must therefore study each case on the basis of specific criteria in order to decide whether or not such an approach can be used. In this context, we should remember that before any peacekeeping force can be deployed, there must be a peace to be managed -- or, at least, a credible political process under way.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">The establishment of the Peacekeeping Commission by the Council completes that conceptual evolution of the work of the Security Council from preventive diplomacy to crisis management to peacebuilding -- the only guarantee for the durability and irreversibility of any solution. Belgium believes that, now that the early work of the Commission has proved to be productive, the Security Council must henceforth consider useful interaction between those two organs -- an interaction that Belgium hopes will be flexible, effective, pragmatic and free from procedural hindrances.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">The presence among us today of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, also provides Belgium -- which is well aware of the distinct functions and responsibilities of the office of the Secretary-General and of the Council -- with an opportunity to state how much it appreciates the daily dialogue and cooperation between those two Charter organs, whose conceptual interplay has in recent decades stimulated and enriched the debates in the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ikoube</span> <span class="nation">Congo</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I should like, first of all, to thank the delegation of Qatar for the manner in which it led our work last month. I would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of January. You can count on the full cooperation of my delegation during your tenure.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">I should like to express my sentiments of friendship to those countries that left the Council at the end of last year -- countries with whom we had excellent relations -- and to welcome the new members; they can rest assured of the full cooperation of the Congolese delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">I should also like to welcome the Secretary-General, who is participating in our work for the first time, and to extend to him our wishes for every success as he carries out his lofty and sensitive mission.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">My delegation welcomes the fact that the Council is beginning 2007 by holding this public debate on a subject that is intrinsically linked to its major mission in an international context characterized by many grave crises. We are therefore grateful to you, Mr. President, for having chosen this item for discussion in the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">Some of the events of 2006 remind us that there are threats to international peace and security on various continents. They range from acts of everyday terrorism to the very real risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as protracted or potential conflicts. Those threats thus represent a daily reality for the international community as a whole and a constant danger for certain populations that live in fear and under threat. Let us therefore take full stock of those threats and ensure that we always make the most appropriate responses to them, which the Council never fails to do.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">The best way to deal with threats to international peace and security is, first of all, prevention. We are pleased to note that the culture of prevention is beginning to take root within the United Nations and in certain States. In that regard, significant progress has already been made at the normative level with the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1318(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1318 (2000)</a> and, particularly, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1625(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1625 (2005)</a>, on strengthening the effectiveness of the Security Council's role in conflict prevention, particularly in Africa. Here, we should also commend the General Assembly for its recent adoption of a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, to whose implementation all States should commit themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">In the Outcome document of the 2005 World Summit (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 60/1</a>), Member States renewed their commitment to promoting a culture of preventing armed conflicts and strengthening the means of prevention available to the Organization. In addition, many strategies have already been indicated in our previous work on this issue. It is important to ensure regular follow-up.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">We also note that, as the Secretary-General stated in his report on the prevention of armed conflict (<a href="../pdf/A-60-891.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/891</a>), the surest way to prevent crises is to reduce the impact of risk factors. While the primary responsibility for prevention falls to Governments, they sometimes find it impossible, for various reasons, to live up to their obligations. Hence, there is sometimes a need to rely on external support -- for example, in the context of the adoption and implementation of measures aimed at regulating the trade in certain resources that fuel conflicts, such as diamonds and timber.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">Among settlement mechanisms, we would stress political dialogue among the parties to a conflict and the good offices of the Secretary-General. That practice has been developing recently, and we encourage it. We always encourage the search for peaceful solutions, and we will assist the Secretary-General in his mediation efforts. In that context, the new mediation support capacity within the Secretariat is an initiative that we welcome and support.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">Unfortunately, when prevention is not enough, we must face up to a sad necessity: conflict management, through existing mechanisms or those yet to be established. That includes the strengthening of peacekeeping capacities -- which, it must be stressed, lack the resources necessary to carry out their missions -- and partnerships within the system and with regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa11">In that connection, we welcome the positive developments in the relations between the United Nations Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council, as evidenced by the recent declaration on cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union defining the framework for a 10-year programme to strengthen African Union capacities, signed on 16 November 2006 at Addis Ababa by the United Nations Secretary-General and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. But as everyone knows, the will and the commitment of the African continent are not always enough to meet logistical or management needs in certain situations as complex as that of Darfur, for example. Hence the need for such a partnership, which is vital for maintaining peace and security on the continent.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa12">The year 2006 also reminded us that the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is not a mere possibility, but rather a reality that can be effectively addressed only through compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which establishes obligations, but also rights, for all signatories. Indeed, it is essential to implement that important instrument in full -- that is, by taking into account its three pillars: non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and the right of every State to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa13">Weapons of mass destruction are and will always be a threat to humanity as a whole, regardless of who possesses them. In the fight against the threat posed by such weapons, the unity of the Council is essential, as are its objectivity and impartiality. Otherwise, its action risks being misunderstood and suspected of being illegitimate.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa14">Once again, we wish to welcome the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, which has just taken its first, tentative steps. We hope that that organ will effectively strengthen the system for stabilizing situations and will help to improve, in a lasting manner, the atmosphere in areas emerging from conflict. We also wish to emphasize the need to take account of the development and human rights aspects in any conflict prevention policy, as recommended by the Secretary-General in his report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. We must emphasize that for some peoples, extreme poverty, hunger, disease and small arms and light weapons represent real weapons of mass destruction and thus pose threats to international peace and security.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wolff</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Let me join others in congratulating you, Sir, and your delegation on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January. We very much look forward to working closely with you. We also welcome the new members of the Council, with whom we look forward to a productive, cooperative relationship over the next two years. I would also like to thank Qatar for its presidency last month and to thank those members whose terms on the Council ended in December.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">In addition, I would like to join others, on behalf of my entire delegation, in welcoming Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the Council for the first time in his new capacity. The Secretary-General will always be welcome here, and we look forward to working closely with him and his colleagues in the Secretariat as the Council attempts to address the most serious challenges facing the international community in the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">I should like to compliment the Secretary-General on his fast start in his first days in office. Among his many early actions, we particularly note and welcome the selection of Foreign Minister Asha-Rose Migiro of Tanzania as Deputy Secretary-General. Tanzania served effectively on this body over the past two years, and it was a privilege to work closely with its Government and its fine delegation during that period. We look forward to working with Mrs. Migiro and with all the other members of the Secretary-General's team in the time ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">You have brought us together today, Mr. President, to talk about the principal mission of the Security Council under the United Nations Charter: its responsibility to maintain international peace and security. Unfortunately, as the work of the Council in recent years has demonstrated, the range of challenges facing the international community grows only more complex and more challenging.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">The Council must act not only to manage conflict, but also to prevent it. The disturbing reality is that a significant amount of the Council's time is spent dealing with conflict within States, rather than conflict between them. Not only does the Council need to act to protect civilian populations that are the target of their own Governments, but experience has demonstrated many times over that in today's world, events occurring in one country affect the world beyond its boundaries. Internal conflicts create unstable borders, increase regional tensions and create significant economic and social burdens. Our continued and urgent focus on the situation in Darfur is just one such example.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">The international community has long recognized, rightly, that a general breakdown of governance and political order, terrorism, cross-border activities by armed groups, widespread and systematic human rights violations and outflows of migrants and refugees represent a threat to international peace and security. The Council needs to be ready to identify and address those kinds of threats before they break out into open conflict or create unacceptable human or material costs.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">We must also strive, together with the Secretariat, to ensure that traditional peacekeeping operations continue to benefit from more sophisticated approaches to assessment and planning. At a time of growing demand for peacekeeping, the Council needs to properly exercise its responsibilities, working with other bodies of the United Nations, to ensure sufficient oversight and effective management of peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">In that regard, we are very troubled by the recent reports of sexual exploitation and abuse by personnel participating in some United Nations missions, and we urge the Secretariat to take appropriate action to ensure that those reports are fully investigated and that those responsible for any such abuses are held accountable.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">It is also critical that the Council help countries emerging from crisis to make the transition to a more stable, long-term path of economic and political development.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">We welcome the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. However, we will measure the success of the Commission on the ground -- in Burundi, Sierra Leone and other countries in which it will engage -- in terms of visible results promoting sustained peace, stability, reconstruction and development.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">Finally, we know with unfortunate certainty that the Council will continue to be seized with the issues of combating terrorism and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Only last week, Al-Qaida issued an explicit threat against the United Nations and its peacekeepers overseas. We know that terrorists still work to kill innocent civilians around the world. This body has a responsibility to meet those threats with unity of purpose and clear resolve.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa12">We  must  also  continue  to  work  to  prevent  the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons and the means of delivering them. That applies not only to terrorists that seek them but also to States that pose a threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa13">In facing those challenges and the others on our agenda, the Council must be prepared to act quickly to respond to emerging threats or developing crises. But we must act in a way that improves the situation on the ground in affected areas. Our efforts must focus on improving the ability of parties to a conflict to come to a solution, and not to make that solution more difficult or simply score political points for one side or the other.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa14">We will continue to work closely with the other members of the Council and the Secretary-General to ensure that the actions of the Council result in tangible progress on the ground in addressing the most pressing challenges the world faces today. We welcome ideas from the Secretary-General about how we might strengthen the exchange of information between the Secretariat and the Council. In conducting our business and generating the mandates that guide the Secretariat's work on our behalf, we still have work to do to make this body as effective as it should be. We need, as one example, to find better ways to anticipate crises and act to prevent the outbreak of, or relapse into, conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa15">Again, Mr. Secretary-General, I join others in welcoming you today. I hope you will be a frequent participant in the Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jenie</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">At the outset, on behalf of my delegation, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month. I also wish to thank you for your warm words of welcome to my delegation as a member of the Council. I would also like to join others is expressing gratitude to the delegation of Qatar for its commendable stewardship of the Council during its presidency last month.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">My delegation would also like to welcome Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the new Secretary-General, with whom we look forward to working closely in enhancing the role of the United Nations in the promotion of peace. We wish to reaffirm our full support and cooperation to him.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">As we journey into a new year, we are carrying with us both contentment and dissatisfaction. We take comfort in witnessing the cessation of some conflicts and the transformation of conflict-affected countries into ones that are steadily rebuilding and reconstructing. The role and contribution of the United Nations and the international community in that graduation are exceptional, and the Security Council has been determined and decisive in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The experience in all those conflicts reaffirms the critical importance of peacekeeping operations in the fulfilment of the Council's primary responsibility in saving humankind from the scourge of war. We believe that the continuing importance of peacekeeping missions should be duly recognized. We also see a need to continue to ensure strict observance of the fundamental principles of peacekeeping.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Peacekeeping alone, however, is not sufficient if our goal is to achieve sustainable peace. In my delegation's view, post-conflict peacebuilding is vital in helping war-torn societies make the transition to durable peace. In that regard, the role of the Peacebuilding Commission is of paramount importance. We look forward to its further constructive contribution to peace consolidation efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">The end of conflict in certain countries in Africa and other regions does not close the chapter on the book of war on that continent. On the contrary, we have witnessed the emergence of new complexities in current conflicts. For example, the presence of cross-border flows of combatants and civilians has impeded existing peace efforts and exacerbated humanitarian conditions in those regions.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">In addressing conflicts, my delegation reaffirms the need for respect for the principles of the sovereign equality, national sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all States, as well as the principles pertaining to refraining from the threat or use of force. The principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes, inclusive dialogue, constructive collaboration and preventive diplomacy should be kept as a priority in addressing threats to international peace and security. Therefore, in the view of my delegation, sanctions should be used as a last resort -- with a clear, transparent and measurable timetable -- and should provide an escape route to allow for reinstating peaceful settlement procedures.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">In the Middle East, peace remains far from a reality. The situation there will remain grim and protracted if the Israel-Palestine conflict is not resolved in a just and peaceful way. My delegation holds the view that the Israel-Palestine conflict is at the core of all problems in the region, and therefore believes that the Council should give high priority to resolving the conflict. Settling the Israel-Palestine conflict in a way acceptable to all parties will have a profound impact on the prospects for peace in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">Reports of the recent decision of the Israeli Government to approve the building of a new settlement in the occupied West Bank, which is in contradiction to its commitment under the Road Map, and the continuing incursions and raids by the Israeli Defense Force into several West Bank cities and towns in the last few days are of deep concern to my delegation. We think that those manoeuvres are indeed against the spirit of the agreement between the Israeli Prime Minister and the President of the Palestinian Authority. The Security Council should respond to that development, as is consistent with its mandate and responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">As a victim of terrorist attacks, and bearing in mind the enduring presence of the terrorist threat, my delegation is convinced that the Council should remain vigilant and act in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Our cause and practice in combating terrorism should be based on respect for human rights and human dignity. Indonesia holds the view that the problem of terrorism is best addressed through a holistic approach.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa11">My delegation also sees the urgent need for a dialogue to address the proliferation of nuclear weapons in Asia. Although the threat of nuclear weapons has subsided in other regions, a new nuclear theatre may be developing throughout West and East Asia. It is therefore important that we find a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issues of North Korea and Iran. We also attach great significance to the speedy establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, a region characterized by instability and tension.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa12">The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as the cornerstone of disarmament, should be strengthened. There should be a balanced undertaking among the three pillars of the Treaty. We believe that, in the end, the absolute guarantee for eliminating the fear caused by the possible use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is the total elimination of those weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa13">Democracy is a universal value, and history proves that it serves as a pivotal foundation for the creation of peaceful societies based on human dignity. In the United Nations forum, we are of the view that there are organs warranted primarily to address democracy and other related issues, including human rights. Their work is notable.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa14">Considering the level of complexity and the magnitude of the challenges that humankind is dealing with in the present day, partnership is the key word that guides us in responding to those challenges. My delegation concurs with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the significance of collective wisdom and collective efforts. We cannot go it alone. The Council cannot stand on its own in fulfilling its responsibility. Conceptually, peace may require a master architect, but in execution it needs the labour of many. While it is obvious that the Council has the primary responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security, we need to recognize the contribution of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council to enhancing the role of the United Nations in the promotion of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa15">In the spirit of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, robust partnership with regional organizations should be strengthened. In spite of known limitations, the value of those evolving partnerships is clearly demonstrated in various regions where the Security Council has enlisted the support of regional organizations to help resolve some disputes.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa16">In order to address future challenges, the Security Council reform process should be sustained. Aspects of the Council's membership, as well as its working methods, are in need of substantive revision. Both are equally important. We view the comprehensive reform of the Security Council as an integral feature of the overall reform process of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa17">In conclusion, we support the draft presidential statement prepared by your delegation, Sir, and look forward to its adoption. I also wish to reiterate the commitment of my delegation to the successful work of the Council under your presidency.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kumalo</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">Let me congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Security Council for this month.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">We also welcome Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to his first meeting with the Security Council. We wish him well and we are among the delegations that are very delighted that he has chosen Ms. Migiro of Tanzania as his Deputy. He has claimed one small victory for gender balance in this Organization very early in his term, and we thank him for that.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Despite the theme of today's debate, the reality is that we come today to discuss the mandate of this Council, which according to the Charter is that of maintaining international peace and security. More than 60 years ago, when the founders of the United Nations bestowed that responsibility upon the Security Council, the world faced different kinds of threats, mostly emanating from inter-State conflicts. Today we are challenged by complex, multifaceted and interconnected threats that go beyond the mandate of this Council. For example, there is the fundamental threat of poverty and underdevelopment that is at the root of most conflicts that find their way to the agenda of this Council. In fact, evidence has shown that even threats posed by terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have a common thread linking them to poverty and underdevelopment. Yet, the mere existence of nuclear weapons is itself a threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">There is little doubt that poverty alleviation is the most effective tool for conflict prevention. Of course, the dilemma we face in this Council is that the issues of poverty and underdevelopment should not and must not be left to an organ, such as ours, of such a limited membership. The General Assembly, which enjoys universal membership, remains the central multilateral forum for addressing the pressing global issues and challenges presently confronting all States. The responsibility for managing and achieving worldwide economic development and social progress, as well as for responding to threats to international peace and security, must be shared among all States and exercised multilaterally through the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">All principal organs of the United Nations, including subsidiary bodies such as the Human Rights Council, have a role to play in developing and implementing a more effective collective security system. A common approach to collective security is legitimate only if it is in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The active participation of each and every principal organ of the United Nations is crucial in the exercise of its respective functions and powers, without upsetting the balance established by the Charter. A range of other multilateral institutions, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations Development Programme, and including the United Nations Development Fund for Women, also have an important role to play in addressing the threats we currently face.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">The challenge for the United Nations is to use its resources in a balanced manner that addresses development, security and the protection of human rights. Therefore, the Security Council as presently constituted is limited in how to deal with the threats of the twenty-first century. While we welcome the effort by the Council aimed at enhancing the approach to addressing the threats we face, we would prefer to do so within the mandate given to us. In carrying out its primary responsibilities, the Security Council should not encroach on the jurisdiction and responsibility of other principal organs of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">The United Nations Charter has placed a significant responsibility on the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Needless to say, that responsibility gives the Council a far-reaching impact on the lives of many people in the world.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">In recent years, the Security Council has been too quick to threaten or authorize enforcement action in some cases, while being silent and inactive in others. For example, the Palestinian-Israeli issue is a legitimate agenda item for this Council. However, it has become quite noticeable how this Council has failed to act even in the face of the most shocking contraventions of international law.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">Instead, the Council has increasingly resorted to taking up issues that do not fall within its mandate. Often, the Council has resorted to Chapter VII of the Charter as an umbrella for addressing issues that may not necessarily pose a threat to international peace and security, when it could have opted for alternative provisions of the Charter to respond more appropriately, utilizing other provisions of the same Charter. Chapter VII should be invoked, but as a last resort.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">My delegation wishes to reiterate our long-standing position on the importance of a closer and effective cooperation between the Security Council and regional organizations in the maintenance of international peace and security. We are particularly encouraged by the institutional relationship between the African Union and the United Nations with regard to collective efforts aimed at resolving African conflicts. Similarly, we express our appreciation for all efforts to promote sustainable peace, development and stability on our beloved African continent.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa11">In the matter of United Nations peacekeeping, respect for the basic principles of peacekeeping -- such as the consent of the parties, impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defence and in the defence of a mandate authorized by the Council -- is essential to its success. My delegation recognizes the role of the Peacebuilding Commission in addressing the special needs of countries emerging from conflict and its assistance in the areas of recovery, reintegration and reconstruction. We look forward to an inclusive debate on strengthening the role of this important body.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa12">Finally, let me once again reiterate South Africa's desire to cooperate with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his team. Also, my delegation stands ready to work with other members of this Council in the maintenance of international peace and security. We thank the Russian presidency for having given us an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment in a presidential statement, which we fully support.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="nation">Panama</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">Allow me, first of all, to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January. We would also like to thank the delegation of Qatar for the work accomplished. I would like to commend you, Mr. President, and the delegation of the Russian Federation for giving us this opportunity to formally welcome the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to whom we wish success in his undertaking and to whom we offer support. At the same time, we welcome this opportunity to address an issue of utmost transcendence, namely, current threats to international peace and security and how best to confront them.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Panama is a country where people of many ethnicities, cultures and religion live in peace and harmony. It is a country that historically has maintained friendly relations with States of different political and ideological orientations. It is a country that by its Constitution is demilitarized, a country that adheres to the doctrine of human security as part of its national laws and a country with a canal that is neutral in accordance with an international treaty and by its own wishes. That is why no one should be surprised that this subject attracts our special attention.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">More than sixty years ago, when our predecessors entrusted the United Nations Organization with the responsibility for and the obligation of maintaining peace and security, they did so with the conviction that by doing so they were contributing to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">However, since then, the world has changed dramatically, and the main threats no longer stem from wars between States. Today, these threats derive principally from destabilization caused by poverty, injustice and marginalization. They come from the spread of infectious diseases, from the scarcity and abuse of natural resources, and from destruction of the environment. They stem from ethnic, cultural and religious conflicts, and from the systematic violations of human rights. They stem from transnational organized crime, from the stockpiling and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and from the illicit trafficking in small arms. Finally, they derive from fundamentalism, especially those forms that proclaim themselves the guardians of the truth and that seek to impose this truth through force, including through terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Necessary and timely attention to these great threats will require us above all to fully know, understand and address the root causes. While it is true that a large share of this responsibility falls to the United Nations, other international organizations, States themselves, nongovernmental organizations and -- why not say so -- all human beings, out of a common moral sense, must do likewise.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Within the United Nations, the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. However, not all potential threats can or should be examined immediately by the Council. There are other principal and subsidiary organs within the United Nations that can and should also contribute to addressing these threats, including the Secretariat, with its vast capacity for preventative diplomacy, the General Assembly, which enjoys universal representation, the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights Council. Each, according to their powers and functions, can contribute to addressing many of these issues.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">In this respect, we should recall that the Charter not only grants the General Assembly the right to discuss any question relating to the maintenance of international peace and security, but also, to a certain extent, imposes the responsibility upon the Assembly to call the attention of the Security Council to those situations that are likely to endanger peace and security. It is no exaggeration to say that the Assembly has much to do in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">With regard to the Security Council, there is no doubt that the spirit and reason for its establishment lie in the need to have one organ that can effectively and efficiently contribute to the resolution of critical situations before they develop into conflicts of greater complexity.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">The Charter, however, imposes on the Security Council the obligation to exhaust all mechanisms it offers and all options of prevention and mediation that are contemplated in Chapter VI, and also demands that the Council cooperate broadly with regional organizations referred to in Chapter VIII, before considering sanctions or the use of force provided for in Chapter VII.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">To address threats to international peace and security, humanity has placed its hopes in the United Nations. In the light of this trust, all United Nations decisions -- but in particular -- those taken by the Security Council, given their binding nature -- must be adopted in strictest conformity with international law. The credibility and legitimacy of its actions and, accordingly, its ability to address current threats to international peace and security will largely depend upon that.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Guangya</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, the Chinese delegation would like to welcome Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is attending a formal meeting of the Council today for the first time in his capacity as Secretary-General of the United Nations, and we thank him for his brief statement made just now.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">Over sixty years ago, the founders of the United Nations entrusted the Security Council with the solemn responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. Since then, both the United Nations and the Security Council have gone through unusual times and experienced major tests. In particular, after 11 September 2001, there has been a profound change in the challenges to international peace and security, with traditional security threats continuing unabated and non-traditional security threats becoming ever more acute.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">In the face of this grave situation, the Security Council has not budged or tried to evade its responsibilities. On the contrary, it has worked hard to change with the times. Its tasks have gradually evolved from the deployment of peacekeeping forces to peacebuilding and reconstruction, and from merely alleviating symptoms to addressing root causes. The Council has also taken a series of actions in response to new threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">In September 2005, leaders of the 15 countries members of the Council gathered here, at the head of State level, to engage in important discussions on how to respond to threats to international peace and security -- discussions which resulted in the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1624 (2005)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1625(2005).pdf" class="pdf">1625 (2005)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">Changes in the international situation have prompted progress in the work of the Council and expanded the scope of its Council's agenda. The Security Council, as the core of our collective security system, has been confronted in this new century by an ever-changing international situation and numerous grave challenges. The common task of the 15 members of the Security Council and of the United Nations family as a whole is to enhance the Council's capabilities and effectiveness so that it can better address the issue of hotbeds of tension worldwide.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">In the view of the Chinese delegation, the first priority is for multilateralism to be upheld and enhanced and the authority of the Security Council preserved. On major issues relating to peace and security, the Council should base its judgment on the practical aspects of the situation and take collective action in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">Secondly, the Council should adopt a long-term strategic perspective; devote greater attention to the comprehensive management of conflicts so as to address both their symptoms and root causes; and formulate and gradually enhance a comprehensive strategy covering aspects ranging from conflict prevention to the restoration of peace, and from peacekeeping to post-conflict reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">Thirdly, the Council should enhance its coordination with the General Assembly and pay heed to the views and concerns of non-Council members, especially those of affected States. It should also strengthen communication and cooperation with the relevant regional organizations, further improve its own working methods and enhance its efficiency.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">As the chief administrative officer of the United Nations, the Secretary-General has a unique role to play in mediating issues relating to national and regional hotbeds of tension. It is undeniable that the Security Council, in addressing the items on its heavy agenda, has benefited from the support provided by the diligent work of successive Secretaries-General and their teams. The Chinese Government deeply appreciates the work done by Mr. Kofi Annan, the former Secretary-General, over the past decade. We have every reason to expect an even more outstanding performance from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Mr. Ban, coming from Asia and known for his diligence, perseverance, moderation and knack for constructive compromise -- which are characteristic of Asians -- will surely give full play to the unique role of Secretary-General in the maintenance of peace and the promotion of development.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">Together with other members of the Security Council, China will, as always, continue to support the work of the Secretary-General, enhance its cooperation with him and work actively for the maintenance of international peace and security. I am convinced that the future of the United Nations and the Security Council will be a bright one.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Voto-Bernales</span> <span class="nation">Peru</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">We would like to congratulate the Russian delegation and you in particular, Ambassador Churkin, on Russia's assumption of the presidency of the Security Council and to assure you of our delegation's full support in the discharge of your important functions.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">Likewise, we congratulate the outgoing President, Ambassador Al-Nasser of Qatar, for his skilled stewardship of the Council in December 2006. We also warmly welcome the five new Security Council members.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">We wish to welcome the presence at this meeting of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, to whom we wish every success in his work, which he is just beginning. We assure him of Peru's full confidence in him and of its cooperation in the discharge of his sensitive mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">As was recognized in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document, we are working on the common understanding that development, peace and security, and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. We must therefore coordinate our actions in order to address threats to international peace and security and their interconnection in a comprehensive and far-reaching manner as well as prevent them, as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1625(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1625 (2005)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">Globalization has had a major impact on the potential for economic inclusion and for knowledge-sharing, but we know that there is also a dark side to     this phenomenon which has aggravated marginalization, thus providing fertile ground for the emergence of fresh threats to international stability. New risk factors have arisen. We know that many of the items on the Security Council's agenda relate to intra-State conflicts, which, for the most part, occur in States with scant progress, fragile institutions and worrisome development indicators.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">To prevent these types of conflicts from multiplying and countries from sliding back into such situations, it is necessary to address not only the military and institutional recovery aspects, which the Security Council has made a priority, but also pay close attention to other factors such as poverty, social exclusion, environmental degradation and trans-national crime, as well as focusing more intently on the issue of cultural diversity.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">Unresolved inter-State conflicts also deserve particular attention. The indefinite prolongation of such conflicts gravely endangers the achievement of the Council's main objectives, and renewed efforts to bring about peace must therefore be made, in the framework of international law and commitments based on mutual respect.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">The threat of the recurrence of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity has sharpened our resolve to recognize that we have a responsibility to protect peoples from such scourges. Thus States Members of the United Nations, including Council members, must be vigilant in order to fulfil our mandate to protect peoples when the State concerned is unable to do so or unwilling to comply with its obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">It is equally urgent that we strengthen disarmament and non-proliferation regimes for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and related systems. Peru supports the Security Council's efforts to prevent the proliferation of such weapons in the hands of State and non-State actors, and also deems it necessary for the multilateral system to redouble its efforts to that end and make further progress in the collective commitments undertaken. We must work towards a system of security based on cooperation that will strengthen peace and security structures and prevent arms races at the global, regional and subregional levels.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">Terrorism has become a universal scourge that must be defeated. It is unacceptable in any shape or form, regardless of motivation. It must therefore must be condemned and combated in all its aspects. In this struggle, the multilateral system has at its disposal 13 international conventions in additional to regional agreements and the more recent Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. In that context, resolute action on the part of the Security Council is vital to combat this threat. The commitment of each and every State must also be unwavering. We must act to ensure that States have adequate operational capacity, above all in the areas of intelligence and police cooperation, as these are key tools in this struggle.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">However, we should not restrict ourselves to this aspect of our work. The activities of irregular armed groups, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, the smuggling of natural resources, drug trafficking and other ways in which organized crime weakens institutions undermine social stability and democracy and pose a threat to security. We must continue to pay priority attention to all of these factors, which converge in a number of existing conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa12">Peru also believes it essential for us to acknowledge the special importance of the role of the environment in maintaining international peace and security. Water, forests and the climate are elements for which we must formulate specific strategies and action plans if we are to prevent the further destruction of natural resources. Deforestation, pollution, abrupt climate change and radiation, among other phenomena, all have a negative impact on the ability of many peoples to subsist and on the quality of life on our planet now and in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa13">The diversity of threats to peace and security and their interrelated nature require the assistance of multilateral agencies and regional organizations, as well as the active participation of the private sector and civil society to respond to such threats, each within the context of its purview.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa14">Finally, I would like to reaffirm Peru's commitment -- drawing on its own economic and social experience and its regional involvement and profound multilateral vocation -- to continue to contribute constructively to international peace and security and to economic and social development, and to support and protect democracy, freedom and human rights throughout the world.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">This meeting of the Security Council is timely in every respect, first and foremost because the focus of our attention is the genuine strengthening of the major responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. This meeting is of special significance, because Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General, is participating in the Council's activities for the first time. I would like, on behalf of the Russian delegation, to welcome him once again.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">In September 2005, during the World Summit, heads of State or Government of the countries members of the Council conducted an exchange of views on the issue under discussion today. There can be no doubt that the world has not become any more stable or predictable since that meeting. The international community continues to face wide-ranging challenges in the interrelated areas of security, humanitarian problems and development. We are still confronting severe challenges resulting from the escalation of armed conflict, international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including the danger of their falling into the hands of terrorists and extremists.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">The time that has gone by since the Security Council summit has not, however, been wasted. The major result is the growing awareness of the fact that there can be no alternative to the consolidation of the central role of the Security Council and the United Nations in the quest for collective solutions to the many global and regional threats and challenges on the Security Council's agenda over the past year -- we need think only of the war in Lebanon, of the problems relating to the observance of the nuclear non-proliferation regime or of the situation in Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">It is significant that, on these and other pressing problems, members of the Council have been able to achieve agreement, sometimes after difficult negotiations, and to adopt effective solutions in the interests of long-term stability.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">We hear criticism -- sometimes not without reason -- of the Security Council and of the entire United Nations for lack of effectiveness in its decisions and actions. This should not lead us to be pessimistic. Indeed, it is only now -- when the world has rid itself of the confrontation of the cold war and is painfully disabusing itself of any illusions of the effectiveness of unilateral approaches -- that the United Nations and the Security Council, for the first time, have an opportunity fully to realize their potential. Working in cooperation with all interested partners, Russia will continue to promote the enhancement of the practical implementation of Security Council efforts to prevent and resolve disputes and armed conflicts, including in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">Special attention must be given to the building up of United Nations potential in the area of peacekeeping. The effort to maintain peace under the authority of the Security Council and in accordance with its decisions remains the hallmark of this world Organization. That has been made clear in the sharp increase in demand for such operations. Today, more than 80,000 military personnel and police contingents are involved in a total of 19 operations. Russian peacekeepers are participating in operations in the Middle East, Haiti, Kosovo, Serbia, Africa, Asia and, with the political support of the United Nations, on the territory of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa08">We are continuing to enhance our contribution to the peacekeeping and humanitarian activities of the United Nations. Not all of the unique peacekeeping opportunities and mechanisms of the United Nations are being fully used. That situation could be improved through the more active utilization of the potential of the Military Staff Committee, as well as of the opportunities provided by regional organizations, on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Charter and with respect for the prerogatives of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa09">We base ourselves on the need to strengthen, through joint efforts, the international legal basis of peacekeeping in accordance with the Charter and the decisions of the Security Council, which will serve to reaffirm multilateral approaches in the area of crisis resolution. The task of enhancing the coordination and effectiveness of our fellow countries emerging from crisis has been entrusted to the Peacebuilding Commission. That body has already taken its first steps in peacebuilding, helping in Burundi and Sierra Leone. We attach great importance to the commencement of the effective activities of that intergovernmental body, in particular through the strengthening of its relationship with the Security Council and the General Assembly, pursuant to the decisions of those organs. We intend to actively support the accomplishment of that task. Combating international terrorism remains one of the key areas in creating an effective system of collective security. The United Nations has a central role to play in that area. The problem of combating terrorism and its sources, and issues relating to the development of broad anti-terrorism cooperation, should in future be the subject of constant attention on the part of the Security Council and the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa10">We also need more vigorous measures to prevent deadly weapons from falling into the hands of non-State entities. A priority in this area is the consistent implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa11">In broader terms, it is necessary to continue work to ensure the smooth coordination of all of the activities of all of the Security Council's anti-terrorist committees, keeping in mind their cross-cutting mandates. The goal is to enhance the usefulness of the activities of all of those structures, while avoiding duplication of effort. The Security Council faces a major challenge in this regard. It is important to make rational use of existing resources, focusing the activities of the Council on those areas relating to threats to international and regional peace and security and observing the division of authority between the major bodies of the world Organization set forth in the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa12">I would like to focus on another important aspect. We base ourselves on the premise that enhancing the effectiveness of United Nations activities in the key areas of strengthening peace and security will be promoted by reforming the management of the Organization and enhancing transparency and accountability in the Secretariat. We wish the Secretary-General every success in modernizing the United Nations, in accordance with international standards and in keeping with the demands of our time.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, I would like to express gratitude to all of our partners in the Security Council for their constructive participation in and agreement on the presidential statement to be adopted later today. We trust that it will serve to further strengthen the potential of Council to carry out its overall mission.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa14">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa15">I give the floor to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I thank you, Mr. President, and the members of the Council, for the kind words addressed to me and for this opportunity to meet with all of you today. I assure you of my wholehearted support and dedication in ensuring the efficient and successful work of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">Before I begin, I would like to pay tribute to the former Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his significant contributions to the work of the Organization over the past 10 years.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa03">I listened carefully to members of the Council in their interventions on this important subject, which is, after all, their primary responsibility under the Charter. I also observed that the members of the Council are united and speak with one voice on the need to view conflict management in a holistic manner: prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. There is also unity among Council members with regard to the need to address conflict in a comprehensive manner, with development and human rights issues being accorded their proper priority.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa04">As your important statement just now made clear, Mr. President, the United Nations has an exceptionally challenging agenda ahead of it in 2007. We face an unprecedented demand for peacekeeping, as well as a range of growing demands for preventive diplomacy, good offices, peacebuilding and efforts in conflict management. The Council, and the Organization as a whole, are going through one of the busiest periods in our history, with a record number of peace operations, resolutions and reports over the past few years.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa05">The Department of Peacekeeping Operations has expanded to cover 18 missions, with a historic high of 100,000 personnel in the field, and climbing. The total number of peace operations in which the United Nations is engaged in some form has risen to around 30. This globalized presence requires ever closer cooperation between the Security Council and the Secretariat -- including, of course, the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa06">Some of our most acute and persistent challenges are in Africa. One of my top priorities will be to step up efforts to address the crisis in Darfur, where the humanitarian situation is growing worse, despite all the declarations and proclamations of the international community over the past three years. In the coming days, weeks and months, I will coordinate closely with leaders in Africa and beyond, and I will work through my Special Envoy for Darfur to secure the constructive engagement of the Sudan, African Governments and the international community as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa07">At the same time, we must stay the course in other parts of the continent. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we must ensure that recent positive developments enabled by our largest peacekeeping operation are consolidated so that lasting peace and stability take hold in the heart of Africa. I look forward to discussing these and other issues with leaders at the African Union summit to be held in Addis Ababa at the end of this month.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa08">Equally, I will strive to inject new momentum into our search for peace and stability in the Middle East. This means rededicating ourselves to the work of the Quartet in resolving differences between Israel and Palestine -- differences which carry such a unique symbolic and emotional charge for people far beyond the physical boundaries of the conflict. It means supporting Lebanon in everything from its physical reconstruction to its quest -- as yet incomplete -- for a peaceful, democratic and fully independent future. And, in the wider reaches of the region, it means continuing our efforts to address the political and security challenges of Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa09">By the same token, we must keep working for a conclusion to the uncertainty that still hangs over the status of Kosovo, which if unresolved threatens to cast a shadow over regional stability in South-Eastern Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa10">So I am glad to join you today for this discussion on a range of issues that no country can resolve on its own -- issues which present threats to the security of people around the world and to the entire international community. Responding to such threats is, after all, one of the primary purposes of the United Nations and a particular responsibility of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa11">As the President of the Council pointed out, recalling the 2005 World Summit Outcome, the threats that we face in this century are multifaceted and interconnected. This is true whether we are considering the threat of terrorism, a faceless enemy that knows no boundaries, or weapons of mass destruction, which present a unique existential threat to all of humanity. Both demand urgent, sustained and comprehensive attention from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa12">The same is true of HIV/AIDS and the other pandemics, which not only take a huge human, social and economic toll on countries that can least afford it, but also pose threats to peace and stability in the devastation that they wreak on capacity and governance.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa13">The same is true of extreme poverty, which breeds a hopelessness that allows for neither mercy nor dignity and which is preyed upon by zealots and extremists to further their agendas and ambitions. Achieving our goals for development around the world is essential to build lasting peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa14">The same is true of egregious human rights violations, weakened governance and failure to uphold the rule of law in various parts of the world. Over the past years, the United Nations has sought to strengthen the three pillars of this institution - those of security, development and human rights, all underpinned by the rule of law - in order to build a more peaceful, more prosperous and more just world for succeeding generations.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa15">We have important achievements to build upon, from the Peacebuilding Commission to the Human Rights Council and the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, as well as the responsibility to protect. But we must also do more to invigorate disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. This will require strengthening the disarmament and non-proliferation regimes themselves, as well as addressing the special challenges posed by the cases of Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa16">The Security Council has acted by adopting important resolutions on these issues, but a great deal remains to be done. It is essential that the international community work as one to address these challenges. I am committed to strengthening and consolidating the work of the United Nations in this direction. In such an endeavour, I shall try to play the role of harmonizer and bridge-builder and work to restore trust between Member States and the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa17">The Council has acted on the reform agenda in areas ranging from the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission to strengthening working methods, while also acting on counter-terrorism and sanctions. I will make it my priority to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to play its role to the fullest extent in conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. I see all of those as a continuum and the role of the United Nations as one that must be coordinated, comprehensive and consistent.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa18">To that end, we need to look at the organizational structures of all departments and offices related to peace and security and find ways to strengthen our capacities. To meet the growing demands of globalized operations, we must identify ways and means to build a staff which is truly mobile, multifunctional and accountable and which lives up to the highest ethical and professional standards.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa19">The draft presidential statement before the Council calls for a strategic approach to the assessment of conflict situations and the planning and management of peacekeeping operations. It will provide an important guideline for me in building such improved capacities and enhancing the delivery of our common objectives. That will be a top priority for me in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa20">Again, let me say how very much I look forward to working with the Council in the years ahead.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I thank the Secretary-General for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. The Council commits itself to work closely and in a focused and action-oriented manner with him in order to better address the multifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats confronting our world within its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, as provided for by the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa04">"The Security Council pledges to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirms its commitment to the principles of sovereign equality, national sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all States, underlines further the need for respect for human rights and the rule of law, including protection of civilians in armed conflict, and the importance of adhering to the principles of refraining, in international relations, from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, and of peaceful settlement of international disputes.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa05">"The Security Council, recalling that the 2005 World Summit Outcome recognized that development, peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, emphasizes that the challenges and threats confronting the international community demand a resolute and coherent response, based on the collective security system of the Charter of the United Nations. The Council reaffirms its commitment to address the whole range of threats to international peace and security, including armed conflict, terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa06">"The Security Council recognizes the essential role of the United Nations in the global effort to combat terrorism, which in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to peace and security. The Council therefore welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. It stands ready to play its part in its implementation. The Council, in keeping with its responsibility in the international community's efforts to combat the scourge of terrorism, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, underlines its determination to intensify its efforts, including in translating the commitments made at the Security Council summit meeting in the course of the 2005 World Summit meeting into practical results. It reiterates further that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights law, refugee law and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms its resolve to take appropriate and effective actions against any threat to international peace and security caused by the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery, in conformity with its primary responsibilities, as provided for in the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa08">"The Security Council recognizes the importance of more effective international efforts to prevent conflict, including intra-State conflicts, and encourages the Secretary-General, as already requested in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1625(2005).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council 1625 (2005)</a>, to provide the Council with more regular, analytical reporting on regions of potential armed conflict, and stresses the importance of establishing comprehensive strategies on conflict prevention in order to avoid the high human and material costs of armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa09">"The Security Council underlines the need for improved United Nations capacity to assess conflict situations and for the effective planning and management of United Nations peacekeeping operations  and for quick and effective responses to any Security Council mandate. The Council also recognizes the importance of a more strategic approach to the oversight and direction of peacekeeping to maximize the prospects for successful transition in the countries concerned, and so as to make possible the most effective use of scarce peacekeeping resources. To this end, the Council requests the Secretary-General, in managing and reporting on peacekeeping missions to focus on the steps needed to achieve the objectives of the mission, both by the host Government and by the international community, and to propose to the Council, as appropriate, initiatives to accelerate the transition process.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa10">"The Security Council emphasizes the importance of post-conflict peacebuilding to assist countries emerging from conflict in laying the foundation for sustainable peace and development and, in this context, welcomes the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission that should play an important role to achieve the objective of improving United Nations capacity to coordinate with regional organizations, countries in the relevant regions, donors, troop contributors and recipient countries and to perform peacebuilding activities, in particular from the start of peacekeeping operations through stabilization, reconstruction and development. It appreciates the progress made thus far in the initial work of the Commission on Burundi and Sierra Leone. The Council underlines the importance of close interaction between the two bodies and will regularly address the work of the Commission in its own discussions and will take into account the advice of the Peacebuilding Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa11">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to working in partnership with the Secretary-General and the Secretariat, other United Nations organs, regional, subregional and other intergovernmental organizations, with non-Council members, including those Member States that are parties to a conflict, and with troop-contributing countries, financial and other stakeholders in pursuit of the common objective of maintenance of international peace and security."</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-1.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
