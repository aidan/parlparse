	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Lebanon, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. de Rivero</span> <span class="nation">Peru</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">First, I want to say that Peru fully endorses the statement made last Friday by the Ambassador of Costa Rica on behalf of the Rio Group.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">On the question before the Council, I must say what I have always said in the Council: the Government and people of Peru have zero tolerance for terrorism. That is why we are a party to the 12 United Nations conventions to combat international terrorism and we are working in close contact with the Counter-Terrorism Committee to implement the measures established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">In its resolute cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Peru has contributed a specialist to the team of experts. A few days ago, within the established time period, we submitted our second national report to the Committee. That report describes Peru's legislation to tackle comprehensively the eradication of terrorism. The report details all the types of links existing between terrorism and drug trafficking and the way our criminal legislation is dealing with the issue. The second report also explains the various criminal acts that have been made punishable under the law in order to combat the financing of terrorism, as well as measures that have been adopted with respect to border security and travel documentation, such as passports and other documents.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Peru has repeatedly affirmed that in the fight against terrorism, Governments must strictly respect the human rights of the population. We say that out of experience because many times in the fight against terrorism conducted by the autocratic Government of Mr. Fujimori, the human rights of innocent people in my country were violated. Those violations are now being punished, and the victims are being vindicated and compensated by the current, democratic Government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">With the same emphasis with which we underline the violations of human rights by Governments, my Government calls on the international community to denounce as violators of human rights the armed groups practicing terrorism, as Amnesty International did years ago. However -- I must be very frank before the Council -- there are still democratic, Western Governments that appear not to have understood the nature of asymmetrical conflict. They are reluctant to go before the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva or the Third Committee in New York and denounce the armed groups practising terrorism as violators of human rights. I hope, as India stated in the Council last January, that the Council will find a way to agree on a list of terrorist organizations. It is necessary that the international community be aware of who are the real authors of this asymmetrical conflict, in order not to have conflicting abstract concepts of terrorism, which is like boxing against a shadow.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">We must also bring to the attention of the Council that the humanitarian institution of political exile must not be debased. The current globalization of terrorism requires that countries accepting refugees should attentively examine the requests for political exile that they receive, in order to avoid risking extending the coverage of that humanitarian institution to possible authors of terrorist acts. Likewise, it is essential that we maintain a vigilant attitude towards certain political refugees so that they cannot use their legal status to carry out propaganda activities and financing for terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">In a globalized world, we must be alert to terrorism. For example, just a few miles from Manhattan, a small group of Shining Path militants has recently held propaganda demonstrations calling for the freedom of their terrorist leaders in Peru. Similarly, we have heard news of a recruitment campaign being conducted by another small group from the Shining Path, coordinating its European activities from Sweden.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">No country can feel itself immune from the impact of terrorism and it is increasingly obvious that resolute and genuine international cooperation is needed to combat this scourge. For all of these reasons, Peru reiterates its firm commitment to that purpose.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lancry</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">In the year since the horrific events of 11 September, the international community, and particularly this Council, have worked with great resolve and determination to adopt measures that will substantially hinder the ability of terrorist organizations to perpetrate their evil acts.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">Israel continues to strongly support and cooperate with the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and extends its congratulations to its Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for his most capable leadership. We fully support the counter-terrorist measures that the Council has established, as well as the CTC's efforts to monitor their implementation. Much important progress has been made and much more remains to be done.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">As a country that has endured the perpetration of countless acts of terrorism on its soil and which continues to deal with that threat on a daily basis, Israel is acutely aware of the dangers terrorism poses to free and open societies and of the need to combat it uncompromisingly and without fear. Israel also understands the challenges facing certain States that have little experience in battling terrorism. Israel stands ready to assist those States by sharing the many strategies and techniques it has developed in its decades-long struggle against terror.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa04">The tragic events of 11 September have taught the world many important lessons about terrorism and the threat it poses to all civilized nations. First and foremost, the world has recognized the fact that terrorism does not exist in a vacuum, but can survive only with the support and complicity of States. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> was predicated on the conviction that if we deny terrorists the safe harbour and financial and logistical support they currently receive from States, we will have dealt a serious blow to the global terrorist infrastructure. These States and others that support terrorism must be targeted no less than the terrorists themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa05">Without the training areas and safe harbour that Al-Qaeda enjoyed in Afghanistan, the attacks of 11 September would likely have been impossible. In the Middle East, many terrorist groups receive training and funding from States in the region, including payments of tens of thousands of United States dollars to the families of suicide bombers. We have also learned that the amount of money and training required to perpetrate a massive act of terrorism is frighteningly small. Just as only a few determined individuals and a relatively small amount of money succeeded in shocking the world on 11 September, it takes only one country granting safe harbour and financial and logistical support to terrorists to sustain a large, complex and deadly organization.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa06">The Counter-Terrorism Committee must therefore insist on full compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by every United Nations Member State. Whereas the cooperation of 180 or 185 Member States on issues such as sustainable development or combating HIV/AIDS is generally considered an extraordinary achievement, the failure of even one State to comply with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> could portend widespread disaster.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa07">The CTC must look carefully and comprehensively at each country's report. It must scrutinize and draw attention to gaps, failures and oversights. It must possess the will, determination and courage to expose and confront those States that have failed to fulfil their responsibilities under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> -- a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter in recognition of the threat to international peace and security posed by terrorists. The consequences of failure are potentially so severe that to turn a blind eye to even one State's failure to abide by its responsibilities is to threaten the security of the entire world.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa08">Another lesson we have learned is that, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, certain parties continue to fabricate distinctions between different types of terror in a deliberate attempt to obscure and divert the international community's fight against terrorism. These parties maintain that differences exist between so-called good terrorism and bad terrorism, between the justifiable targeting of civilians and the unjustifiable targeting of civilians.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa09">Israel believes that such distinctions are not only wrong and contrary to the most basic principles of international law, but that they are also profoundly dangerous. Accepting that terrorism can be legitimate under certain political conditions threatens to severely undermine those parties willing to resolve disputes through peaceful means. If the international community tolerates any act of terrorism as a legitimate tactic, it risks discouraging the very methods it has championed for the peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa10">Furthermore, accepting that there are different kinds of terrorism will weaken the international community's war on terrorism by allowing States to take shelter behind the argument that the type of terrorism they support is of the "justifiable" kind. We must defend the principle that no cause or grievance ever justifies the deliberate and indiscriminate targeting of civilians. We must define terrorism on the basis of what one does, not what one does it for.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa11">As the Secretary-General declared in the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September, and as he has emphasized on other occasions,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg003-bk04-pa12">"There can be no acceptance of those who would seek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent civilian life, regardless of cause or grievance. If there is one universal principle that all peoples can agree on, surely it is that." (<i><a href="../html/A-56-PV.12.html">A/56/PV.12</a>, p. 3</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa13">The cause of terrorism is fundamentally the success of terrorism. If terrorist organizations and their patrons see that they can engage in morally abhorrent tactics without losing sympathy or international standing, it will merely embolden them and those who emulate them. If terrorist tactics succeed in intimidating the international community and extracting concessions from it, we are only inviting further terror and run the risk of destabilizing vast regions of the globe.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa14">The success of any terrorist organization serves as an inspiration to terrorist organizations elsewhere. Conversely, the defeat of terrorism anywhere, and our collective refusal never to succumb to its threats, will send a clear message to terrorists everywhere. If we are to be victorious in our campaign to rid the world of terrorism, we must clearly demonstrate our resolve never to reward terrorism or to allow terrorists to succeed in their goals.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa15">Those who trample our most fundamental values by targeting innocent civilians, and those regimes that do not act to prevent such atrocities by failing to fulfil their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, must be made to pay a price. It is the responsibility of the Security Council to set a high price for such actions and to take the steps necessary to exact it.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Israel for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Burkina Faso. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kafando</span> <span class="nation">Burkina Faso</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">It is both a pleasure and a source of pride for me to see you, Sir, presiding over this important body. As you are well aware, these sentiments are first and foremost due to the very strong personal ties that bind us, as well as to my delegation's confidence that, under your presidency, the Security Council will surely carry out useful work. That confidence is also borne out by our knowledge of your thoroughness, competence and sense of duty. We would also like to congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Tafrov, on having presided over the work of the Council last month with such great skill.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">It took the disaster of 11 September 2001 for the entire world to comprehend the tragic and hideous nature of terrorism in all its dimensions. Until that time, this had been for all of us something that happened to other people. The barbaric acts we witnessed for over a decade in Algeria and those in Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam, Egypt and other places had theretofore been reported as news briefs and events that barely intruded on our tranquillity. But today, in both our collective and individual memories, terrorism represents a terrible reality and a real wound; so much so that some even avoid using the term terrorism because of its emotional resonance. What is important is that we have decided to combat this scourge collectively and resolutely.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">The anti-terrorist effort begun last year mobilized the entire international community, which is now united in a spirit of survival. Not since the anti-Nazi coalition has the world had such a keen awareness of a common enemy. Immediately after the events of 11 September, most States strengthened their national legislation with regard to combating terrorism. On the multilateral level, the United Nations has taken a decisive role in this crusade by adopting resolutions on the question and by establishing the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Impressive resources have also been mobilized in this effort.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Despite all those efforts, however, there is still much to be done. The fall of the Taliban regime and the destruction of their sanctuary in Afghanistan, as well as the arrest of some terrorists, and their detention, including at Guantanamo, have not yet served to eradicate the Al Qaeda organization, which continues to defy the world by threatening to carry out biological terrorism. At the same time, the financial networks of that terrorist organization have been replaced. Al Qaeda reportedly continues to receive funds from the personal inheritance of Osama bin Laden and from the proceeds of his investments. That is to say nothing of the fact that, according to United Nations experts, the financing of terrorism continues to benefit from the support of many financial intermediaries and Islamic charitable organizations. The Swiss prosecutor general, inquiring into the banking activities of terrorists in his country, has stated that most of Al Qaeda's financial assets have been converted into gold and diamonds and are now beyond the reach of banks.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Like the phoenix of Greek mythology, terrorism always rises from its ashes. Let us make no mistake: the battle we have decided to wage will be long and difficult. It is not something that can be carried out by a single State or by a group of States, regardless of their power. This is something that involves us all, and it is for that reason that we believe that the appropriate framework to pursue this effort and to achieve success is the United Nations, which is the super-national Organization par excellence with the responsibility of guaranteeing international security. Any solitary undertaking runs the risk of becoming an exercise in adventurism. That indeed was the warning of the Secretary-General when he said that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg004-bk02-pa06">"Even the most powerful countries know that they need to work with others, in multilateral institutions, to achieve their aims". (<i><a href="../html/A-57-PV.2.html">A/57/PV.2</a></i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">In our view, the anti-terrorism strategy must be based on the following three imperatives. First, it is the duty of States that have not yet done so to bring their national legislation into line with the needs of combating international terrorism. For instance, in Africa, under the aegis of the African Union, the Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism has just attained the necessary number of ratifications to enter into force. The African Union conference on terrorism recently held in Algiers also served to strengthen the legal arsenal in this regard by adopting additional protocols to that Convention.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Adapting national laws to the needs of the moment should be aimed at enhancing the vigilance of police and security services, including through careful border controls. We were stunned to learn that, before the attacks of 11 September, the main instigators had met several times in major European cities in order to plan their crimes, right under everyone's noses.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">Secondly, it is essential to strengthen inter-State cooperation in this regard, especially in the area of information exchange. This is one of the most reliable preventive measures we can take to thwart terrorist plots. It is thanks to such cooperation that two of the major plotters of the 11 September attacks were neutralized in Karachi on 11 September 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">In this respect, the establishment by the United Nations of the Counter-Terrorism Committee has made it possible today to centralize the important and valuable information transmitted by more than 175 countries. Burkina Faso, which, together with other nations, is firmly committed to this struggle, has already submitted to the Counter-Terrorism Committee its report on measures taken by my country to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, and the members of the Committee, for the remarkable work that they have already done; the results are already evident.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">Finally, everything must be done to prevent the use, by terrorists, of weapons of mass destruction. Armed only with pocket knives, they managed to cause the destruction of the twin towers. What would happen if they had weapons of mass destruction?</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">Such are the few thoughts that today's debate inspired. When dealing with the elusive subject of international terrorism, no one speaker can be exhaustive. Only by sharing ideas and bringing together our proposals will we be able to take a decisive step towards the eradication of international terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ileka</span> <span class="nation">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">I would like to join earlier speakers in warmly congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council and express my delegation's satisfaction at seeing such a worthy son of Central Africa presiding over its work for the month of October.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">We believe that your intellectual ability and diplomatic skills, together with your great experience of international relations, will ensure the success of the Council's work this month.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">I would also like to congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Stefan Tafrov of Bulgaria, and express my sincere gratitude to him for having guided the work of the Security Council so ably and energetically during previous month.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">International terrorism is a threat to international peace and security. A concerted response by the entire international community and all peace-loving States will be required if we are to put an end to it. It undermines the very principles that underlie our universal Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">The horrific events of 11 September 2001 showed clearly that no State is spared the scourge of terrorism. Current scientific developments are disturbing, and suggest the possibility that biological, bacteriological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction could be used for terrorist purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">The Democratic Republic of the Congo has always advocated combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and we therefore welcomed the Council's adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> on 28 September 2001, which was certainly an important first step towards curbing, if not eradicating, the scourge. We also welcome the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, so skilfully chaired by Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">I would like, on behalf of my delegation, to commend Ambassador Greenstock for his excellent statement last Friday on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We would once again like to thank him, the Vice-Chairmen, the members of the United Kingdom Mission and the Secretariat for the work that they done. An impressive number of initial and supplementary national reports have been submitted and there has been a significant number of accessions to several conventions and protocols relating to the suppression of certain manifestations of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">My delegation believes that the participation of the entire international community in combating this scourge means a commitment by each State to comply with the relevant international conventions through acceding to them and through its ability to take action at the national level to ensure their full implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">In accordance with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has undertaken to sign all 12 international anti-terrorist conventions and protocols, which form the core of the legal arsenal in this respect. Furthermore, in an effort to standardize and give specific effect to the efforts of the international community against this scourge, my country supports initiatives designed to resolve outstanding issues, in particular the adoption of a comprehensive convention and the convening of an international conference on terrorism. Such initiatives would round out commitments and actions at our disposal to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">At the national level, my country's commitment was given substance by <i>(presidential decree 70/2001)</i> of 26 September 2001, which set up a national coordinating committee to combat international terrorism. The committee, which includes representatives from the Foreign Ministry, the Transport Ministry, the Interior Ministry, the special security services, the police, the courts, customs, the central bank and other public bodies, will be deliberating on all issues relating to international terrorism, coordinating the implementation of relevant international conventions and defining, coordinating and implementing all national strategies and measures necessary to combat, prevent and suppress international terrorism, through close collaboration with foreign Governments and international organizations, in particular through increased cooperation and the full implementation of international conventions.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">That committee will thus be the national body responsible for taking action to combat terrorism in the seven areas referred to in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>: legislation, financial asset controls, customs, immigration, extradition, law enforcement and arms trafficking.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">In addition to having established that committee, we are in the process of drafting a law on terrorism. It is geared towards bringing the national legislation of our country into line with the principles of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and existing conventions, as well as to filling in any gaps in our legislation by drafting a specific law on the subject. The bill provides for, inter alia, the identification of individuals and groups involved in terrorism and terrorist activities, prosecution, judicial cooperation and penalties for the perpetrators of such acts, including those who finance them.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa13">The Democratic Republic of the Congo and its people have been victims of the most insidious and abject form of international terrorism -- State terrorism -- perpetrated by neighbouring countries in flagrant violation of the Charter. We are therefore ready to promote discussion and bring to fruition our work on terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa14">Terrorism is not limited to acts by individuals or isolated groups. It encompasses the large-scale organized activities used by States as a political instrument -- activities whose nature and consequences are very serious.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa15">It is indeed that form of terrorism -- State terrorism -- that we must combat fully. Its consequences are incalculable and it represents a real threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa16">The Democratic Republic of the Congo has always believed the problems facing the world today cannot be resolved by the use of force. In order to combat terrorism we must develop a universal conscientiousness and sense of unity capable of eradicating this scourge and other tragedies that threaten the very survival of the human species.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa17">We in Congo are in agreement with what you said, Mr. President, in your brilliant statement made at the closing of the general debate in the current session of the General Assembly, that, in a situation which does not always lend itself to optimism, the peoples of the United Nations are nevertheless continuing their progress towards the future as outlined at the Millennium Summit -- a world in which people will live free from all fears and from need.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa18">In this regard, my country believes that in addition to strengthening the legal arsenal that we have to suppress terrorism, which is necessary, combating terrorism also requires an integrated approach and must take account of the political, diplomatic, economic, social and humanitarian dimensions of the problem. For, rightly or wrongly, certain individuals or groups of people feel that they are victims of injustice, and that feeling feeds intolerance.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa19">Hence the community of nations must take an integrated and responsible approach and tackle the problems head on, including armed conflict, poverty, disarming armed groups and transnational crime in general. My country will soon be making a request for assistance to strengthen our institutions and human capacity to combat terrorism. The Democratic Republic of the Congo calls for greater solidarity and full cooperation to combat terrorism and its causes, including injustice, poverty, crime and armed conflict, so as to free people from fear, as you so well said, Mr. President, and ensure a better and prosperous future for present and future generations.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Ukraine. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I would like to warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency for the month of October. I also wish to extend our gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Stefan Tafrov, and his team for their excellent performance last month.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">I would like also to thank the Secretary-General for joining us at last Friday's meeting and for his important statement, as well as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for his very informative briefing on the activities of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">I have the honour to deliver the statement on behalf of the States participating in GUUAM: the Republic of Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The year that has passed since the tragic events of 11 September 2001 has not extinguished the anger and indignation of mankind caused by these terrorist acts, nor has it soothed the pain and bitterness at the loss of innocent lives. These acts became, in fact, a direct challenge to the entire civilized world and proved that no State could face the challenges of the twenty-first century alone.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">As was emphasized by the Secretary-General, terrorism is an assault on the fundamental principles of law, order, human rights and the peaceful settlement of disputes -- principles upon which the United Nations was built. Therefore the United Nations should play a central role in our common struggle against terrorism. In this regard we support the strategy of the United Nations approach to the issues of terrorism, which was outlined in the report of the Policy Working Group on the United Nations and Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">The GUUAM Participating States believe that the Security Council is uniquely placed to facilitate cooperation between Governments in the fight against terrorism. Last year, the Council adopted the exceptionally strong and important resolution -- <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> -- designed to enhance international response to the threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">We share the views expressed by previous speakers that the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) established by that resolution is making a valuable practical contribution in our common struggle. The CTC helps the world system to upgrade its anti-terrorism capability and to deny space, money and support to terrorists. As mentioned earlier by the United States and other delegations, the crucial role of the Committee in making international anti-terrorism legal instruments universal cannot be overestimated.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">The CTC has established constructive dialogue with Member States. This great achievement will certainly help us to identify potential gaps and find effective ways to address them. In this regard, we are grateful to the Chairman and the members of the Committee, as well as to the experts, for promoting maximum transparency of the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">The CTC has extended its role beyond monitoring the implementation by States of their obligations. GUUAM welcomes the CTC's activities in providing assistance to States for ensuring effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The character and scope of the Committee's mandate and working methods represent an important innovation and open up new possibilities for inter-State cooperation. I wish to reiterate GUUAM's continued support for the CTC in the discharge of its important duties.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa10">Among the achievements of the CTC outlined by its Chairmen, I would like to underline its endeavours to provide all possible assistance to the multinational anti-terrorist coalition by strengthening, inter alia, the capacities of the regional organizations and groups. For their part, the GUUAM Participating States have committed themselves to consolidate their efforts in the fight against international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa11">At the recent GUUAM Summit, held this July in Yalta, the Presidents of the Participating States reiterated their firm positions on the issue of combating terrorism and organized crime. They reaffirmed the determination of their countries to provide political, legal and organizational bases for overcoming the challenges of international terrorism, separatism, intolerance, extremism and related illegal actions. All these commitments were included in the Declaration on Common Efforts to Ensure Stability and Security in the Region, which was signed at the GUUAM Summit.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa12">GUUAM attaches great importance to the strengthening of its legal basis. In this regard I would like to report that at the Yalta Summit the GUUAM Participating States signed an agreement on cooperation in combating terrorism, organized crime and other dangerous types of crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa13">GUUAM fully recognizes the danger posed when the proceeds from crime are used to finance terrorist activities. Attaching special attention to that problem, the Presidents of the participating States charged their Governments with thoroughly examining the issue of establishing close interaction between GUUAM and the Financial Action Task Force on Money-Laundering.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa14">The efforts of GUUAM to combat terrorism received their logical continuation during the first meeting of the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the GUUAM States, which was held here in New York at Headquarters on 18 September. At that meeting, the Ministers reiterated the importance of enhancing cooperation within GUUAM in the sphere of combating terrorism and organized crime. They expressed their readiness to elaborate specific projects in the framework of such cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa15">Finally, let me emphasize that GUUAM stands ready to make a worthy contribution to the collective efforts of the international community in fighting terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Jarbussynova</span> <span class="nation">Kazakhstan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I should like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting, which gives us an opportunity to share our views on a subject of the utmost importance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">The fight against international terrorism has become a matter of the highest priority since 11 September 2001. The immediate reaction of the General Assembly and of the Security Council in the days that followed the terrorist attacks confirmed the Organization's strong determination to put its legitimacy behind effective international action. The Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which tackled terrorism in an unprecedented manner and upgraded the capability of the international community to face a new global threat.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Since then, the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) has stood at the forefront of the fight against terrorism. We should like to express our appreciation to the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for his leadership in steering the work of the Committee. Our thanks go also to the independent experts for their dedicated work. The fruitful activities of the CTC and of Member States aimed at implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> have led to the elimination of numerous terrorist cells and of the channels of their financial support.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">According to information provided by the CTC, more than 172 national reports were received in the first round of reporting and 83 reports have been received in the second round. My Government, fully committed to implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, has submitted two reports to the Committee thus far and has engaged in dialogue with the CTC on issues related to that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">We shall continue to cooperate with the CTC, and we expect from the Committee more practical results with regard to eliminating the breeding ground for new terrorist attacks. That breeding ground, we believe, still exists in Afghanistan, and it threatens international peace and security. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> has set out a road map for eliminating terrorism, and therefore it is important that the CTC strengthen its efforts in the search for those who provide financing and specialized technical support for terrorists. The United Nations has the significant task of monitoring the resolution's implementation through the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">Kazakhstan has always spoken out against terrorism, and it has been actively engaged in developing a system for countering terrorism at the regional and international levels. A number of bilateral and multilateral agreements have been concluded, including the Tashkent Agreement among four Central Asian States on joint action to fight terrorism, political and religious extremism, transnational organized crime and other factors threatening the stability and security of the parties; and the Shanghai Convention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism, signed by member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Kazakhstan contributed to the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States Anti-Terrorist Centre, and a similar mechanism is currently being established within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. In addition, Kazakhstan has concluded bilateral cooperation agreements with numerous countries on combating terrorism and international organized crime, and now it is cooperating actively with other States in the prevention, identification and suppression of acts definable as terrorist acts, by exchanging information and by taking steps to combat the financing of terrorism and the supplying of weapons and ammunition to terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">Kazakhstan is reconsidering the international instruments on terrorism with a view to becoming a party to them. On 2 October this year, Kazakhstan ratified the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Now we are in the process of ratifying the 1997 International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. In June this year, the first summit meeting of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) was convened in Almaty. The adoption at the summit meeting of the final documents, of the Almaty Act and of the CICA Declaration on Eliminating Terrorism has had extraordinary significance. The documents unconditionally and unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as well as any support for or acquiescence to it and the failure to directly condemn it. They declare the determination of CICA member States to cooperate on a bilateral and a multilateral basis to combat terrorism, including its possible sources. The participants in the process will unite their efforts so as not to allow terrorism in any form to be organized, assisted or financed from the territory of any State, nor to allow terrorists to be provided safe haven.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, I should like to refer to the statement of the Secretary-General before the Security Council meeting held on the first anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States:</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">"The past year has also given us hope that terrorism can be defeated if the international community summons the will to unite in a broad coalition. As the work of this Council has shown, the United Nations remains uniquely positioned to serve as the forum for that coalition, and for the development of those steps that Governments must now take -- separately and together -- to combat terrorism on a global scale."

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Turkey. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cengizer</span> <span class="nation">Turkey</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">First of all, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the Security Council for this month. I should also like to thank you for organizing this open meeting. One year has elapsed since the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in the wake of the tragic events of 11 September, and convening this meeting is a timely initiative that gives Member States an opportunity to make a few comments on the Committee's work thus far. In addition, my delegation thanks Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the CTC, for his briefing to Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">While aligning ourselves with the statement made Friday on behalf of the European Union, we should like to highlight certain points.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">Terrorism is a threat to the very existence of individuals, of nations and of human civilization as a whole. It is a means of oppression that humiliates the individual and obstructs the development of humanity. No consideration whatsoever can be invoked to justify terrorist acts. Terrorism is simply a violation of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">Turkey has been calling for intensified international cooperation against terrorism. It is our firm belief that the only way to overcome international terrorism is through coordinated action among the members of the international community. In this regard, we have been actively engaged in the work of the organs of the United Nations to combat this scourge at various levels. Here, I would like to underline certain points concerning international cooperation against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is an effective instrument, and we lend our full support to its implementation. We congratulate the CTC for the work it has been carrying out since its inception. Turkey has submitted two comprehensive reports to the CTC, as envisaged by the resolution, and looks forward to working closely with the Committee. The reports presented by Turkey to the Counter-Terrorism Committee put forward the basic parameters of Turkish legislation for the prevention of terrorism, as well as the actions taken by Turkey in international forums. As mentioned in our reports, we have been working closely with other States, both in our region and within the international organizations of which Turkey is a part.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">Another important aspect of cooperation relates to the 12 international conventions against terrorism adopted so far. We are party to all 12 conventions, and we call upon all States that have not yet done so to become parties to them. Moreover, we expect States fully to implement the bilateral, regional and multilateral anti-terrorist conventions to which they are parties.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">Along the same lines, we look forward to further progress in the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly on discussions on a comprehensive convention against international terrorism and on the International Convention on the Suppression of Nuclear Terrorism. In setting up these legal instruments, it is important to ensure that there is no safe haven for terrorists in any country, regardless of their motivation or of the type of crimes they have committed.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">I would like to emphasize once again the urgent need to put aside selective attitudes based on political motivations and tolerance for, or the condoning of, certain terrorist movements. We expect all States to pursue a consistent and determined approach in fighting terrorism without any leniency whatsoever.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Turkey for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Ethiopia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hussein</span> <span class="nation">Ethiopia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">At the outset, my delegation would like to congratulate you, Sir, on Cameroon's assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of October. We also wish to thank you for organizing this open meeting of the Council and hope that others after you will also continue in this tradition.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">Many have referred to the terrible and horrible events of 11 September. Allow me to touch on another aspect related to that date. For us in Ethiopia, that date, prior to September 2001, was always associated with the beginning of the Ethiopian New Year, and hence was normally a joyous day. However, it is no longer celebrated in the same manner as in the past, in deference to the people of the United States and of other countries, including my own, whose nationals were among the victims of the incidents in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">Yet it has also reinvigorated our previous fight against terrorism. Before 11 September 2001, my country and Government had for 10 years been fighting terrorists in our own country and within the region.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">May I at this juncture commend the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and in particular its Chairman, Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, for diligently carrying out their mandate. Their work has been exemplary, in our view.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">In his statement last Friday, the Chairman of the Committee stated:</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">"The CTC is not a tribunal and does not judge States, but it does expect every State to work at its fastest possible speed to implement the far-reaching obligations of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> ... There is still much more work to do before terrorists find that there is no safe haven, because the bar against terrorism has been raised in every country." <i>(supra)</i></p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">We fully agree with him. In this context, I wish to address only one small part of the commitments that we all made because we supported <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>: the raising of funds in all of our countries -- maybe more in some. Nevertheless, this is an area in which all of us have to do something.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">Under that resolution, we are expected to take measures against those in our territories who provide or collect funds with the intention of using these funds or of making them available to organizations bent on carrying out terrorist acts in other countries. I think that we should abide, where we have not done so, or continue to abide, by the decision that is implied clearly in that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">My delegation welcomes the initiative by the CTC to deepen its relationship with subregional, regional and international organizations. We welcome it because it is a new initiative. This, in our view, will induce countries involved in such organizations -- subregionally, regionally and internationally -- to coordinate their own activities against terrorism more effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">At the same time, I should like to call on the CTC and on others in a position to do so -- in order for this to really be very effective -- to give whatever technical assistance may be possible in the combat against terrorism. Here let me take my own subregion -- the Inter-Government Authority on Development (IGAD) subregion in north-eastern Africa -- as an example: while we are doing something on our own, certainly we would welcome assistance in this regard. Indeed, we have been receiving bilateral assistance from certain countries, some of which are Council members. But we would like the CTC to coordinate this. We also want the Secretariat to be involved, through them.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa11">Finally, I should like to state that Ethiopia will, as in the past, continue to cooperate with the CTC and others in the fight against terrorism. I am reiterating that position today.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Musambachime</span> <span class="nation">Zambia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">On behalf of my delegation, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. We have no doubt that with your immense experience, the deliberations of the Council are in good hands. In the same breath, we would like to extend our appreciation to Ambassador Stefan Tafrov, Permanent Representative of Bulgaria, for the able manner in which he steered the work of the Council for the month of September.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">My delegation also welcomes the very important statement by the Secretary-General made to the Council last Friday. We also welcome the report submitted by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for its depth and analytic perspective. We also thank the Vice-Chairmen and the experts for their commitment and dedication. The work of this Committee has been exemplary.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">Mr. President, my delegation thanks you for calling this timely meeting to allow Member States to contribute to this very important debate on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. Zambia is committed to international efforts to eliminate terrorism in all its aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">As most members of the United Nations are aware, my country paid dearly in life and infrastructure at the hands of the apartheid and Rhodesian regimes for more than two decades, when, for geographical considerations, my country supported the noble aspirations of the Southern African region to self-determination and independence. Therefore, we have the experience and are an example of how a vibrant economy can be undermined by acts of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">Terrorism is real. It has very grave consequences for life, business and development. The statistics from the aviation industry regarding the impact of the tragic events of 11 September 2001 on international travel are only the best-documented of the consequences of terrorism. Terrorism can undo gains it has taken many years to achieve. Above all, international terrorism can very often create hostilities between and among nations, thus endangering international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">It is against this background that my country has always condemned acts of terrorism in all their aspects, no matter by whom committed, or where. Zambia has worked through the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the newly launched African Union to promote collective efforts in the fight against terrorism. It is also against this background that my country welcomes the commendable work of the Security Council, which, in response to the tragic events of l1 September 2001, adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1368(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1368 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> on this subject. When the General Assembly expressed its position on the matter, Zambia worked with other Member States in adopting <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 56/1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">The fight against international terrorism is a global effort that requires the support of all countries. The question of countering international terrorism in all its aspects should be the concern of all countries. It is, therefore, appropriate that the Security Council hold public debates on the subject to enable Member States to share views on the issue with the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">My Government believes that multilateral efforts carried out within the framework of the United Nations will be more effective than efforts taken at the national level. The horror of international terrorism threatens all States without exception. Strengthening multilateralism should be the core principle in the ongoing reform of the United Nations to make it more effective and relevant to the changed times.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">Zambia stands ready to cooperate with the other countries in the southern African region, the African Union and the United Nations to enhance the efforts against terrorism. Therefore, I wish to reiterate my country's appeal to all countries to ensure that terrorist groups are prevented from gaining access to nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations and regional organizations are the institutions that should take the lead in this effort.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Threats to international peace and security posed by international terrorism are real. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is increasing. There is an urgent need for the Security Council to ensure that collective efforts are not based on emotion and other previously conceived notions that only serve to make global efforts even more difficult. It is my Government's deep conviction that increased international efforts towards the effective elimination of international terrorism would secure international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">As a developing country, Zambia is concerned that the fight against international terrorism will overshadow efforts against poverty and disease, such as HIV/AIDS. We urgently require foreign direct investment, which is so badly needed to make a difference to many millions of people who live on less than one dollar per day.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">The fight against international terrorism should also be extended to its breeding ground, poverty. Our efforts must not, I repeat, be confined to military options only. Rather, the efforts of the United Nations should be concentrated on a thorough examination of the phenomenon of terrorism, including its roots, its support bases and the different forms it has taken around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa13">If well executed, the fight against terrorism might unlock the puzzle surrounding the failure to achieve socio-economic development. As many in this room are aware, terrorism and its infrastructure are financed through illegal activities, including arms smuggling, drug production and trafficking. The profits made from these illegal activities are ultimately used to purchase weapons of terror. In other words, for the United Nations to win the war against terrorism, the efforts must not be confined to one country or region, because terrorism is a common enemy of all countries and peoples. Above all, it is the number one enemy to stability, peace and democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa14">From what I have said, it is clear that all countries, religions, beliefs and cultures are vulnerable to terrorism. The fight against terrorism should, therefore, unite, not divide, our resolve. Terrorism must be defined with reference to its acts, and not to its perpetrators. International law should not support the impunity of terrorists, because terrorism is contrary to any legal norms. Terrorists are criminals of the highest category because of the indiscriminate nature of terrorism and its negative impact on society.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa15">As a country that upholds the sacredness of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence, Zambia knows very well the difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist. Liberation movements are legal bodies with clear objectives and programmes of actions that are available to all those who are interested. On the contrary, terrorists have no missions, their activities are illegal and often they claim to represent mysterious forces that exist only in the minds of the perpetrators.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa16">I wish to conclude by underscoring the importance of working together on this question within the framework of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa17">The work of the General Assembly's Ad Hoc Committee through the Sixth Committee Working Group requires the support of all States. Supporting the work of the Ad Hoc Committee will promote the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. This will further expand the frontiers of our war against international terrorism. It is our firm conviction that the elaboration of such a convention would provide a universal definition of terrorism that would apply in all situations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa18">It is the hope of my delegation that the Security Council will strengthen and not weaken multilateralism in our fight against terrorism.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the Permanent Observer of the African Union to the United Nations, His Excellency Ambassador Amadou Kébé. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kébé</span> <span class="non-nation">African Union</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for October. We are sure that under your leadership significant progress will be made on the important items on the Council's agenda. I would like also to thank you for inviting the African Union to participate in this public debate on the threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">The events of 11 September 2001 reverberated like an earthquake that roused our consciousness from its slumber, shook our certainties and marked a radical break in the way we see the world and envisage the future. The world became suddenly and brutally aware that a hideous monster was there, crouching in the shadows, ready to strike anywhere and anyone, and that it had extended its tentacles through an international network. It became aware also that, given its diabolical plans and its worldwide scope, only an uncompromising, coordinated and global response would be able to overcome it. It is good that the world woke up on 12 September 2001 with a clear understanding that it needed to coordinate its efforts and wage a common struggle to overcome international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">I welcome that awakening, because the terrorist threat has been going on for decades throughout the world. Countries that were targeted felt that this was some marginal phenomenon, and they felt they could cope alone. In third-world countries, where the phenomenon held sway, and where we did not have the resources that major countries have -- I am thinking, in Africa, of Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia -- we began to sound the alarm, calling for concerted international action to overcome this international ring that had sworn to bring independent sovereign States to their knees. Nobody wanted to listen, however, to those faraway voices that were predicting the end of a world. The reason was, unfortunately, that most of these terrorist groups had found a foothold in the big capitals of the world, where they were tolerated to a fault.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">Of course, terrorist acts that blindly strike whole populations, destroy civilian infrastructure, disrupt national and international transportation and undermine State authority and the fundamental universal values that underlie the very survival of the human civilization are indeed a real threat to international peace and security. If there is one thing on which there has been unanimity since 11 September 2001, it is that.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">Moreover, everybody agreed on the need to coordinate all combat actions against this universal threat since 11 September 2001. So what are we debating here? It is that the international community has not been able to find a clear definition for terrorism, to identify it and to expose it for what it is to the world.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">For the organization that I represent, most of whose members achieved independence after a long national liberation struggle, it is intolerable that populations struggling for their independence against the occupation of their national territories and against the denial of their human rights should be confused with terrorists. To make the struggle a coherent whole we must, sooner or later -- indeed the sooner the better -- all agree on a universally accepted definition of what terrorism is.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">Africa did not wait until 11 September 2001 to organize the continent against terrorism. I spoke of the unrelenting struggle that Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia have waged against terrorist movements for over a decade. We recall also how Kenya and Tanzania were struck hard by the 1998 attacks against the United States embassies in their territories. It is on that basis that in July 1999, at the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Summit in Algiers, the heads of State or Government of the OAU adopted the OAU Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, thereby providing Africa with a unique continent-wide legal instrument. Our resources being very meagre we felt, before others, the need to unite to combat the threat posed by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">In the Dakar Declaration against Terrorism, which was adopted in October 2001 at the OAU Summit, member States rejected terrorism and recognized the devastating impact of terrorism and the obstacles it poses to development and stability in the African continent.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">On 11 September 2002, recognizing the meaning of that date and seeking to further consolidate the anti-terrorist struggle in Africa as part of the worldwide movement against terrorism, the African Union organized a high-level intergovernmental meeting in Algiers on terrorism in Africa. The meeting garnered the requisite number of ratifications of the 1999 Convention, which will enter into force in the next few weeks, and adopted a Plan of Action, whose preamble states:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg013-bk02-pa10">"The implementation of the Algiers Convention has become urgent, given the determining role of Africa in the international struggle against terrorism and its legal obligations in the context of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa11">The African States have undertaken, under the provisions of the plan of action, to share their experiences acquired in the fight against terrorism, as well as their resources.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa12">I am pleased to report to the Council that Africa is ready to play its part in the overall struggle against terrorism in all its forms. It also awaits the support and assistance of the international community to make effective its legal instruments and the relevant administrative and judicial provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa13">I would like to end this part of my statement by mentioning, and welcoming, the fruitful cooperation between the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Ambassador Greenstock, and the leaders of the African Union. That cooperation culminated in Ambassador Ward's participation in the Algiers meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa14">That is evidence that this kind of partnership between the United Nations and regional or subregional organizations, if cultivated and supported, can help us make significant progress in matters of common concern.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa15">I should also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank the Government of Norway and other donor countries that have provided such important financial assistance, which has enabled us to hold this important meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa16">In conclusion, I wish to offer a final observation. It is our belief that it is illusory to focus our common action solely on the manifestations of terrorism. Defeating terrorism is not simply a matter of pruning the branches; we must, above all, attack the deep roots of evil. In other words, we must make sure that we wage a relentless fight against extreme poverty, injustice, frustration and marginalization, which today afflict almost two thirds of humankind and is fertile ground for the proliferation of terrorist acts and their justification.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa17">Without doubt, 11 September changed our world. Now we must begin to build the foundation of a new world in which cultural values and civilizations, instead of confronting and fighting one another, will accept one another, will talk to one another and will exchange mutually enriching experiences. Are we not, after all, a single and unique race on this single and unique Earth?</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa18">If our civilization, which, like any civilization, is perishable, fails to learn the terrible lessons of the twentieth century, with its two world wars and the first use of the atomic bomb, we will no longer be able to put our hope in man.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa19">We are meeting here today because we place our hopes in man and the values he embodies, and to mobilize overall support for them.</p>

	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I thank the observer of the African Union for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Lebanon. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diab</span> <span class="nation">Lebanon</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">Allow me, at the outset, to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month. We are convinced that the work of the Council will be crowned with success, thanks to your able guidance.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">Holding this series of public meetings of the Security Council within the framework of the Counter-Terrorism Committee will certainly contribute to strengthening international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and against all threats to international peace and security. It also expresses the earnestness and the transparency with which the Council is addressing this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">On behalf of my delegation, I express our appreciation for the efforts made by Ambassador Greenstock, who has successfully led the Counter-Terrorism Committee created pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Lebanon believes that the United Nations is the ultimate reference regarding issues of international peace and security and respect for the rules of international law. Therefore, Lebanon underscores the key role played by the United Nations in combating terrorism, which we condemn in all its forms. Lebanon also reaffirms its firm commitment to respect international legitimacy and the need to implement the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">Lebanon reaffirms that it is also prepared to cooperate constructively with the General Assembly in its efforts to develop a comprehensive convention to combat international terrorism, a convention that is in keeping with the rules of international law and the principles of national sovereignty, particularly the distinction between terrorism and the struggle against foreign occupation, a convention that always seeks to pursue the principles of justice and law.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">In that regard, I wish to recall that even before the events of 11 September 2001, Lebanon had to combat terrorism on its own soil. Indeed, the Lebanese army confronted local forces inscribed on the terrorist list, and was able to prevail against them. Since the events of 11 September, Lebanon has been cooperating closely with the United Nations, the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the international community to fight the scourge of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">To date, Lebanon has acceded to 10 of the 12 international conventions pertaining to the fight against terrorism, adopted by the United Nations and its specialized agencies and organs. Lebanon is ready to accede to the two remaining conventions -- the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. I wish to point out here that the protocols and international conventions to which Lebanon has acceded are in force today in Lebanon and take precedence over national legislation. For its part, the Lebanese Parliament authorized the Government in 1999 to ratify the Arab Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism, whose provisions are also in force today and take precedence over national legislation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">It is difficult for any human society to achieve a climate of security without seeking political, economic and social justice. That is why we believe that purely security-oriented approaches or partial, phased solutions cannot alone succeed in combating and eliminating terrorism. Rather, such approaches must be accompanied by other efforts that take into account political and other requirements for achieving just and comprehensive solutions to present conflicts in various regions of the world, in particular the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">Indeed, if we find peaceful, comprehensive and just solutions to those crises, we can ease tension in those regions and eradicate most sources of violence and terrorism. Here, I cite the words of the Secretary-General when he addressed the Council on Friday, 4 October: (<i>spoke in English</i>)</p>
	<blockquote id="pg015-bk02-pa09">"[We] must act with equal determination to solve the political disputes and long-standing conflicts which generate support for terrorism.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg015-bk02-pa10">"... Only then can we truly say that the war on terrorism has been won." (<i><a href="../html/S-PV-4618.html">S/PV.4618</a>, p. 4</i>)</blockquote>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sharma</span> <span class="nation">Nepal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa01">Accept, Sir, our warmest congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. I thank you for convening this timely and important debate on an issue of common interest.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa02">Terrorism imposes on nations political instability, economic dislocation and social disharmony, holding back their development and throwing them into the abyss of mayhem and anarchy. Prolonged terrorism frays the very fabric of society. It undermines the rights and dignity of people, frightens them and disrupts their normal life.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa03">The scourge of terrorism is not new. It has long been inflicting unspeakable pain and destruction on many nations and peoples. Nepal, like many other countries, has been living through horrible uncertainty and brutality, in our case caused by the Maoist terrorists as they wage a bloody war against human rights and the freedoms of people, and against the constitutional monarchy, which is the symbol of our national unity.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa04">However, the world woke up to the unprecedented horror of terrorism on 11 September last year, when people from far and wide witnessed passenger jets flying into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, tearing down those monuments of American wealth and power and killing thousands of people. It was a nightmare for the United States, as well as for the entire world community.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa05">It was testimony that terrorism had gone global in its scope and had become a grave threat to international peace and security. It was evident that the bull had to be taken by the horns, and it was critical for the global community to work in concert to stamp out this menace and remove it from the face of the earth.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa06">It has been a year since the world community stood up and swung into action against the menace. In a rare display of unity and resolve among nations, the General Assembly unequivocally expressed its outrage, and the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> to tackle the threat that undermines our civilization and which challenges the principles and values the United Nations upholds.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa07">Thanks to the unwavering commitment of nations and to the commendable work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the momentum is alive and well one year on. The Committee has been able to perform its rather dry and demanding work in a remarkably friendly, interactive and constructive manner, fostering a unique sense of partnership with the nations it works with.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa08">Nepal strongly supports the work and approach of the Committee and underlines the need to continue it vigorously in the days to come. We must succeed in our collective quest to defeat terrorism because, if we failed, the consequences could be unimaginably dire.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa09">For instance, last time it was an attack on commercial and office buildings. The next time, terrorists could target nuclear installations, spilling radioactive clouds into the air and into cities and towns. They may use chemical and biological weapons. They may some day even use crude nuclear weapons as well, causing unthinkable devastation to life and property. Those would be real possibilities, not fictional imaginings, if terrorists stole, or rogue States shared, the requisite information and technology to do those things. To avert such prospects and to eradicate terrorism, the global community must continue taking sustained and comprehensive measures to enforce the existing global treaties and laws.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa10">Nepal, as the Council knows, is a party to five global anti-terrorism treaties and has enacted a new law that incorporates the provisions spelled out in those treaties and which addresses our own specific needs in dealing with the Maoist violence. Several other regulatory and administrative steps to give full effect to the law are also under way.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa11">The Counter-Terrorism Committee's work, we believe, will help countries to identify the gaps in their measures and to respond appropriately to bridge them. However, the Committee must ensure that there is more specificity and clarity in its questions so that it can get concrete and factual answers from countries in their responses.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa12">Once gaps and difficulties have been identified, the Committee should be able to assist nations that need its help to evolve and to strengthen their legal and structural frameworks to implement the anti-terrorism instruments more effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa13">On a different plane, there is a clear need for a comprehensive international convention against terrorism to tie up the loose ends and to bring coherence and vitality to our shared anti-terrorism efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa14">Aside from legal measures, concerted endeavours to reduce poverty and to promote growth and sustainable development in developing countries are critical to curb terrorism. The poor must be given hope and opportunity through education, health services and employment so that terrorists cannot sell utopian dreams to exploit the common masses.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk04-pa15">As we throw ourselves into the quest of stamping out terrorism, we should not tolerate political expediency that may cloud our judgement and make room for double standards. There is no good terrorism or friendly terrorists. They are all evil and they seldom spare their benefactors and protectors, let alone their sworn enemies.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Nepal for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">I call on Sir Jeremy Greenstock to respond to the questions that have been asked and the comments made.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">I am very grateful to you, Sir, for calling this general debate on this subject a year on from the creation of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), because I think it has been both informative and, I am glad to say, very supportive of the programme which the CTC has set itself. That broad support is very necessary to me and to members of the Committee because the best way for mandatory obligations to be fulfilled is through active and voluntary cooperation between Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">I have been impressed by the evidence in this debate that the unity of United Nations Member States in condemning and combating terrorism has been fully sustained over this past year. I am very pleased that the CTC's programme has been warmly supported both within the Security Council and by Member States outside it. It is a programme of coordination, of stimulation of activity, of assistance to those who need it and, of course, of assessment of where the gaps are. On that last point -- and I think the Permanent Representative of Nepal has just referred to this -- we will begin, over this next period, to get more pointed in calling for effective action to fill the gaps that our experts and we identify.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">I am glad that, in several interventions, there has been a continuing focus on human rights -- on the denial of human rights that terrorism itself represents, as the Permanent Representative of Peru pointed out -- and on the need for us to remain aware of human rights obligations. There have also been many references -- I am glad to say some proud references from those who have achieved it -- to the 12 conventions and to the need for widespread ratification of those conventions by Member States. I wish, however, to say once again how important it is that each Member State, in taking on board the obligations under those conventions, understand that it is also necessary to move on to operational action to give expression to what those conventions call for. Actually taking measures to combat terrorism on the territory of each Member State is a requirement of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The conventions are a necessary step on this road, but not a sufficient one and I think that the Council is united in both realizing that and in calling for that action.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">I am very pleased to hear of continuing activity, not just on the regional but on the subregional level as well. We heard this morning from members of the Georgia Uzbekistan Ukraine Azerbaijan Moldova Group in Eastern Europe; of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development in North-East Africa; and of the Southern Africa Development Community in southern Africa. The Economic Community of West African States is also taking measures as a subregion in this area to complement the work which the great regional organizations are doing in the continents. I hope that every Member State within its own region will consider subregional activity with its immediate neighbours, because collective activity among those who depend on each other to keep the defences up against terrorism is very important. Within that, of course, as the Permanent Representative of Ethiopia pointed out, it is vital that assistance be available not just to Member States individually, but also to their regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">I would like to remind Member States with respect to the approach of the CTC that we will facilitate such assistance -- call for it, identify the need for it and point to the sources of it -- but that we will not be the operational purveyors of assistance. Those who need it must be responsible for getting it; those who give it must make contact with those who require it; but the CTC will be the active facilitator, coordinator and supplier of information about such activity.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">Lastly, there were several references to the wider picture, which is not for this debate to enlarge upon. But, as the Permanent Observer of the African Union eloquently pointed out, poor development and poverty are a growth medium for support for the kind of activities which terrorists undertake. There is no doubt in my mind that the effective eradication of terrorism would both contribute to and be enhanced by effective sustainable development policies. These are the responsibility of the whole United Nations membership, individually and collectively, but anyone wanting a successful effort against terrorism must be prepared to contribute to them.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">I believe that this has been a useful and encouraging debate, and I reiterate my thanks to the Council for its support for the work of the CTC and for the leadership of the Bureau in that work for the six months to come.</p>
