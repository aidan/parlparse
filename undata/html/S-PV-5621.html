	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I wish to draw the attention of members to <a href="../pdf/S-2006-1019.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2006/1019</a>, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on Chad and the Central African Republic pursuant to paragraphs 9 (d) and 13 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1706(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1706 (2006)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council reiterates its concern about the continuing instability along the borders between the Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic and about the threat which this poses to the safety of the civilian population and the conduct of humanitarian operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council takes note of the Secretary-General's report of 22 December 2006 (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-1019.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/1019</a>), which contains preliminary recommendations on the deployment of a multidimensional United Nations presence in eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic. It notes the position taken by the Central African and Chadian authorities in favour in principle of such a presence and looks forward to their continued engagement in preparing for it.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council notes the Secretary-General's intention to authorize the immediate return of the technical assessment mission to the region in order to complete its observations that were curtailed on security grounds and requests him to submit, by the middle of February 2007, updated and finalized recommendations on the size, structure and mandate of a United Nations multidimensional presence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"To accelerate preparations for an early decision on the possible deployment of a multidimensional United Nations presence, the Security Council requests that the Secretary-General deploy as soon as possible an advance mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, in consultation with their Governments, as envisaged in paragraph 88 of his report."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-2.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/2</a>.</p>
