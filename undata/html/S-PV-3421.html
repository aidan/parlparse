	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa02">Members of the Council have received photocopies of a letter dated 1 September 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina addressed to the President of the Security Council, which will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1023.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1023</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa04">&quot;The Security Council is deeply disturbed at continuing reports of acts of ethnic cleansing by the Bosnian Serb party in the Bijeljina area. It condemns this practice wherever it occurs and by whomsoever it is committed, and demands its immediate cessation. It further condemns all violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, for which those who commit them are personally responsible. In this context, it calls for the full implementation of the agreement on the release of detainees contained in the 8 June 1994 Agreement concluded in Geneva. It calls for the early release of all detainees and, to this end, calls for the delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross to be granted access in particular to all detainees in Lopare and other parts of the Bijeljina area.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa05">&quot;The Security Council reaffirms the importance it attaches to the United Nations Protection Force's right of freedom of movement throughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It notes with dismay that the Bosnian Serb party has not allowed the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to visit Banja Luka, Bijeljina and other areas of concern and strongly urges it to permit such access both to the Special Representative and to UNPROFOR. It also expresses its concern about continuing restrictions on access to Sarajevo, and in particular the closure by the Bosnian Serb party of the routes across the airport opened in cooperation with UNPROFOR following the 17 March 1994 Agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-50.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/50</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa07">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
