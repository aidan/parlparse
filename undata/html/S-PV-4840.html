	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">France has just voted for the draft resolution that has been adopted as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1510(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1510 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">Afghanistan is now at a critical juncture for its future. We commend the determination of the international community to support the Afghan people and authorities to assist them to meet the immense challenge of reconstruction and peace.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">For its part, France is already greatly involved in Afghanistan, and intends to remain so. With respect to security, French forces are taking part in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and in the operations against terrorist networks in the framework of Operation Enduring Freedom. Moreover, the French army is helping, side by side with United States forces, in the training of a new Afghan army.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">Nevertheless, France considers that the extension of the ISAF mandate that the Security Council has just decided on does not entail a commitment of its forces outside Kabul. France does not plan to involve itself in missions beyond those that it is currently fulfilling.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">The resolution authorizes ISAF to protect international civil personnel involved, in particular, in reconstruction efforts and humanitarian assistance. We understand that the protection provided by ISAF relates above all to the civilian personnel of the provincial reconstruction teams (PRT).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">It is essential today that the international community give its full support to the Afghan authorities to enable them to exercise effective power over the entire Afghan territory. This is the full meaning of the Bonn Agreement, in both the letter and the spirit. The international community must spare no effort to help Afghanistan to take its fate into its own hands once again. France will continue, with many other nations, to do its part.</p>
