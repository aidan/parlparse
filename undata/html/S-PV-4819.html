	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">As this is the first meeting of the Security Council for the month of September, may I begin by paying a particular tribute on behalf of all of us to His Excellency Ambassador Mikhail Wehbe, Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations, for his very distinguished and very important service as President of the Council in the month of August. I am sure I speak for all of us in expressing our appreciation of the role which Ambassador Wehbe and Ambassador Mekdad both carried out.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">In particular, I would like to express every best wish to Ambassador Wehbe, who after a long period of service to his country at the United Nations in New York, is now going to move on to another part of the United Nations family. We have no doubt that he will continue to carry on his work with the same distinction in Geneva as he has done in New York. We wish him every success and the best of luck in that appointment.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa01">I would not have wanted to intervene at this point in the meeting, but since this will be the last Council meeting I shall attend, I would like, Sir, at this very first meeting of your presidency to begin by congratulating you. I am confident that you will lead the Council's deliberations this month with your well-known wisdom and diplomatic expertise. We know that you will lead the Council to success. This month is full of events, notably a meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers, who will be here in New York for the opening of the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">I would like to thank you wholeheartedly, Sir, for the kind words you addressed to me. I also take this occasion to thank all the Permanent Representatives on the Security Council, and the members of their delegations, for the cooperation and assistance they extended to me, as well as for the coordination they all undertook to ensure international peace and security. I wish each and every one of them success in their endeavours.</p>
