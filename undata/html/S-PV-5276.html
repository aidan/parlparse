<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council expresses its grave concern at the decision of the Government of Eritrea to restrict all types of United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) helicopter flights within Eritrean airspace or coming to Eritrea, effective as of 5 October 2005, which will have serious implications for UNMEE's ability to carry out its mandate and for the safety of its staff.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"Recalling all previous resolutions and statements of its President regarding the situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Security Council emphasizes that the aforementioned decision of the Government of Eritrea gravely contravenes the Council's call in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1312(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1312 (2000)</a> on the parties to provide UNMEE with the access, assistance, support and protection as the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities signed in Algiers on 18 June 2000 between the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Government of the State of Eritrea (<a href="../pdf/S-2000-601.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/601</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council further underlines the need for implementation of the decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission without further delay, which will enable UNMEE to fulfil its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms that both parties bear the primary responsibility for the implementation of the Algiers Agreements and the decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council calls upon the Government of Eritrea to immediately reverse its decision and to provide UNMEE with the access, assistance, support and protection required for the performance of its duties. It also calls on both parties to cooperate fully and expeditiously with UNMEE in the implementation of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council also calls on both parties to show maximum restraint and to refrain from any threat of use of force against each other.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates its call upon both parties to achieve a full normalization of their relationship including through political dialogue between them for the adoption of further confidence-building measures and to consolidate progress achieved so far."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-47.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/47</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
