	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the planned convening of the continual round of Inter-Tajik talks in Ashgabad. It commends the efforts of the President of Turkmenistan in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa04">"The Security Council calls upon the Tajik parties to begin as a matter of urgency this round of talks with the aim of concluding a general agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Protocol on the fundamental principles for establishing peace and national accord in Tajikistan signed by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan and the leader of the Tajik opposition on 17 August 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-720.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/720</a>, annex).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa05">"The Security Council expresses the hope that the Secretary-General's Special Envoy will be able to resume promptly his efforts with regard to the preparation of the forthcoming round of talks. The Council reaffirms its full support for the activities of the Special Envoy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa06">"The Security Council urges the Tajik parties to comply strictly with the obligations assumed under the Agreement on a Temporary Cease-Fire and the Cessation of Other Hostile Acts on the Tajik-Afghan Border and within the Country signed in Teheran on 17 September 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1102.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1102</a>, annex I). The Council expresses the hope that the convening of the talks will contribute to a lessening of tensions along the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa07">"The Security Council notes that the relevant Afghan authorities have given their agreement to the establishment of a liaison post of UNMOT in Taloqan (northern Afghanistan). The Council welcomes this development and agrees with the proposal to establish such a post as suggested in paragraph 20 of the Secretary-General's report of 16 September 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-799.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/799</a>) with the privileges and immunities necessary for the security of the United Nations personnel concerned and for their ability to carry out the mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa08">"The Security Council also notes the Secretary-General's observations regarding the strengthening of UNMOT in paragraph 21 of his report. The Council supports a corresponding increase in the mission's strength."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-54.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/54</a>.</p>
