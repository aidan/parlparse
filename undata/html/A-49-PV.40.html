	<p id="docA49PV40-pg002-bk05-pa02">The five non-permanent outgoing members are the following: Brazil, Djibouti, New Zealand, Pakistan and Spain. These five States cannot be re-elected and therefore their names should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV40-pg002-bk05-pa03">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in 1995 the following States: Argentina, Czech Republic, Nigeria, Oman and Rwanda. The names of those States, therefore, should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV40-pg002-bk05-pa04">Of the five non-permanent members which will remain in office in 1995 three are from Africa and Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV40-pg002-bk05-pa05">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: two from Africa and Asia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean and two from the Group of Western European and Other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV40-pg002-bk05-pa06">In accordance with the established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to be elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa and one from Asia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV40-pg002-bk05-pa07">I should like to inform the Assembly that the number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected.</p>
