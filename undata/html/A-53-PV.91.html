<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rønneberg</span> <span class="nation">Marshall Islands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk15-pa01">At the outset, I wish to thank the Rapporteur of the Second Committee for his hard work and for his reports to the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk15-pa02">The convening next year of a special session to review the implementation of the Barbados Conference is of extreme importance to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and indeed to all small island developing States. For this reason, my delegation is extremely disappointed that the Second Committee could not find an equitable solution to the issue of the representation of those States which are not Members of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk15-pa03">As the draft resolution is currently drafted, these States will be able to be present only as observers, even though they are independent and sovereign States and did participate as full members in the Barbados Conference itself. My delegation sees this as further evidence of the increasing marginalization of small island developing States, and we deeply regret that the General Assembly is about to endorse this state of affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk15-pa04">My delegation has regretfully decided to accept the consensus which has been forced on us by a minority in the Committee for reasons that we believe were unrelated to the particular draft resolution. We have been forced to accept this consensus for the sake of retaining other important aspects of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk15-pa05">My delegation will work closely with the delegations of the small island developing States affected by the situation so that their participation in the special session and in its preparatory process will be more meaningful than that which has been envisaged by the small minority.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk05-pa01">At the 31st meeting of the Second Committee, held on 2 November 1998, the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Mr. Nitin Desai, made a statement to introduce and explain the report of the Secretary-General on the role of microcredit in the eradication of poverty, documents <a href="../pdf/A-53-223.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/223</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-53-223-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/223/Add.1</a>. The text of that statement was subsequently issued on 15 November 1998 annexed to a note by the Secretariat, document A/C.2/53/7. That document elaborates some of the points in the report of the Secretary-General; it should be viewed as an integral part of that report, and the two should be considered together.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk05-pa02">The preference of the Bangladesh delegation would have been to appropriately adjust the text of the draft decision recommended in paragraph 15 of <a href="../pdf/A-53-613.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/613</a> to take this into account. However, owing to time constraints, we went along with the decision to recommend the draft decision to the Assembly. At the same time, however, we would like the General Assembly to take note both of documents <a href="../pdf/A-53-223.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/223</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-53-223-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/223/Add.1</a> and of document A/C.2/53/7.</p>
