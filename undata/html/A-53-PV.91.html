	<div class="p">I should like to inform the General Assembly that, during this session, the Second Committee adopted 36 draft substantive proposals. These proposals should be considered to be significant contributions of the Second Committee to the process of revitalization of the United Nations activities in the economic and environmental fields. The Committee tried to promote the establishment of favourable conditions for the sustainable development of all nations of the world, developed and developing, economies in transition, small island States and landlocked countries. We have come to agreement on 32 draft resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p">Now I should like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Second Committee for their contribution to the work of the Committee and to thank the Chairman, Mr. Bagher Asadi, and the three Vice-Chairmen, Mr. David Prendergast of Jamaica, Mr. Burak Özügergin of Turkey and Mr. Odyek Agona of Uganda, for their efforts in successfully completing the work of the Committee. My thanks also go to the members of the Secretariat for their assistance and endurance.</div>
	<div class="p">I have the honour to submit the reports of the Second Committee to the General Assembly for consideration.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The Acting President: </b>The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the Second Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records.</div>
	<div class="p">May I remind Members States that under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</div>
	<div class="p">May I also remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</div>
	<div class="p">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Second Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Second Committee. This means that where a recorded vote was taken, we will do the same, unless the Secretariat has been notified otherwise in advance.</div>
	<div class="p">I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote the recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Second Committee.</div>

	<div class="p">At the outset, I wish to thank the Rapporteur of the Second Committee for his hard work and for his reports to the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The convening next year of a special session to review the implementation of the Barbados Conference is of extreme importance to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and indeed to all small island developing States. For this reason, my delegation is extremely disappointed that the Second Committee could not find an equitable solution to the issue of the representation of those States which are not Members of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">As the draft resolution is currently drafted, these States will be able to be present only as observers, even though they are independent and sovereign States and did participate as full members in the Barbados Conference itself. My delegation sees this as further evidence of the increasing marginalization of small island developing States, and we deeply regret that the General Assembly is about to endorse this state of affairs.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation has regretfully decided to accept the consensus which has been forced on us by a minority in the Committee for reasons that we believe were unrelated to the particular draft resolution. We have been forced to accept this consensus for the sake of retaining other important aspects of the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation will work closely with the delegations of the small island developing States affected by the situation so that their participation in the special session and in its preparatory process will be more meaningful than that which has been envisaged by the small minority.</div>

	<div class="p">At the 31st meeting of the Second Committee, held on 2 November 1998, the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Mr. Nitin Desai, made a statement to introduce and explain the report of the Secretary-General on the role of microcredit in the eradication of poverty, documents <a href="../pdf/A-53-223">A/53/223</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-53-223-Add.1">A/53/223/Add.1</a>. The text of that statement was subsequently issued on 15 November 1998 annexed to a note by the Secretariat, document A/C.2/53/7. That document elaborates some of the points in the report of the Secretary-General; it should be viewed as an integral part of that report, and the two should be considered together.</div>
	<div class="p">The preference of the Bangladesh delegation would have been to appropriately adjust the text of the draft decision recommended in paragraph 15 of document <a href="../pdf/A-53-613">A/53/613</a> to take this into account. However, owing to time constraints, we went along with the decision to recommend the draft decision to the Assembly. At the same time, however, we would like the General Assembly to take note both of documents <a href="../pdf/A-53-223">A/53/223</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-53-223-Add.1">A/53/223/Add.1</a> and of document A/C.2/53/7.</div>
