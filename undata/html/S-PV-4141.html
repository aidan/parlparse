	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations. Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan, <a href="../pdf/S-2000-387.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/387</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan of 5 May 2000 (<a href="../pdf/S-2000-387.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/387</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the success achieved in the peace process in Tajikistan with the completion of implementation of main provisions of the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan signed in Moscow on 27 June 1997 under the auspices of the United Nations (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-510.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/510</a>). It expresses its appreciation for sequential and persistent efforts of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan and the leadership of the Commission on National Reconciliation in this regard. The Council acknowledges the significant achievement of the Tajik parties which have managed to overcome many obstacles and to put their country on the path to peace, national reconciliation and democracy. It joins the Secretary-General in hoping that these achievements will be consolidated in the further strengthening of the institutions in the country with a view to the democratic, economic and social development of Tajik society.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction that the United Nations has played a successful and important role in the peace process. It highly appreciates the efforts of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT), supported by the Contact Group of Guarantor States and International Organizations (the Contact Group), the Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Collective Peacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (the CIS Peacekeeping Forces), in assisting the parties in the implementation of the General Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council expresses its appreciation to the Russian Federation, the Islamic Republic of Iran and other interested Member States for their sustained political support for the peace efforts of the United Nations in Tajikistan, for assisting the parties to maintain political dialogue and to overcome the crises in the peace process. It encourages the members of the former Contact Group to continue to support Tajikistan in its further efforts to consolidate peace, stability and democracy in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction that UNMOT maintained excellent relations with the CIS Peacekeeping Forces and the Russian border forces, which contributed to the success of the Mission and helped to support the political process on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council reiterates its support for the intention of the Secretary-General to withdraw UNMOT when its mandate expires on 15 May 2000. It pays tribute to all those who served in UNMOT for the sake of peace in Tajikistan, and especially to those members of UNMOT who gave their lives in the cause of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council emphasizes that the continued support of the international community in the post-conflict phase will be crucial in allowing Tajikistan to sustain and build on the achievements of the peace process, and in helping it to lay a durable foundation for a better life for its people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"In this regard, the Security Council expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his intention to inform the Council about modalities of the establishment and functioning of a post-conflict peace-building office of the United Nations in Tajikistan in order to consolidate peace and promote democracy. It encourages close cooperation between this office and the Mission of the OSCE and other international agencies in Tajikistan. The Council also encourages Member States and others concerned to make voluntary contributions to support projects aimed at social and economic rehabilitation of this country."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2000-17.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2000/17</a>.</p>
