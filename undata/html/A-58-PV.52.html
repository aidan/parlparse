<div class="spoken" id="1-9">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Zouari" nation="Tunisia" language="Arabic">
	Mr. Zouari (Tunisia)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It is my distinct pleasure once again to convey to you, Sir, Tunisia's congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session, in which I wish you every success. Allow me to read out the statement of Mr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, President of the Republic of Tunisia, to the General Assembly on the International Year of Sport and Physical Education:</div>
	<div class="p">"A few weeks ago, the international community celebrated the United Nations International Day of Peace. This was an opportunity to renew our commitment to the core principles of the United Nations Charter, including the establishment and consolidation of peace, security and development, and to the means of achieving those objectives. This is particularly true in the current sensitive international situation, which requires keeping the Organization's activities and instruments up to date.</div>
	<div class="p">"That is the context for the desired aspect of sport as an influential factor in the life of our societies, along with their political and economic aspects. To be sure, sport today is a school of life, the beneficial impact of which is not confined solely to health and physical well-being, but extends to the acquisition of values that are necessary to social cohesion, the establishment of relations, the consolidation of friendships, and the enrichment of dialogue among races, cultures and civilizations.</div>
	<div class="p">"It is also within that context that Tunisia has taken the initiative of submitting to the General Assembly the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.2.pdf">A/58/L.2</a>. This debate provides us with an excellent opportunity to convey our sincere thanks and appreciation to the General Assembly for having unanimously decided at the last session to include on its agenda an item related to this draft resolution. The draft is a working tool that will contribute to achieving internationally-agreed development goals, including those set forth in the Millennium Declaration, aimed at achieving further solidarity and cooperation and at disseminating a culture of peace.</div>
	<div class="p">"The objectives of the draft resolution are commensurate with Kofi Annan's decision to create a position of Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for Development and Peace. The establishment of that post reflects his personal commitment to promoting sport and physical education and his belief in their influence on and importance to the growth of young people and the life of our societies. It also confirms the increasing attention being focused by the United Nations on this area, as evidenced by the Millennium Development Goals and the guidelines of the United Nations specialized agencies, in particular the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, as well as other entities. We believe that the educational aspects of the draft resolution before us are in keeping with the goals established by the International Olympic Committee when it called for the slogan `culture and Olympic education' to be the watchword for 2003.</div>
	<div class="p">"We in Tunisia have always sought to ensure that sport and physical education hold a fundamental place in our educational system, for they contribute to physical, psychological and social balance and strengthen our country's development process. We have also striven to instil sporting values and the Olympic spirit in our new generations at all educational, professional and civil levels and to base relations between our athletes and others worldwide on mutual respect and harmony in order to strengthen the bonds of mutual acquaintance, friendship and tolerance among all humankind.</div>
	<div class="p">"In its dedication to this approach, Tunisia is working to reify these values by adopting a comprehensive education, social and development policy that defines sport and physical education as useful training and supervisory tools in the dissemination of education, health, development and peace. This noble concept of sport has prompted us to join our efforts to those of the international community to make sport an instrument for promoting peace and development worldwide; to guarantee the right of all children and young people of all ages and in all countries to practice sport and physical education; to help them draw the best possible physical and mental health benefits from this practice; and to make sport an effective tool for promoting development and consolidating peace throughout the world, especially in the least developed countries, where basic infrastructure and sport facilities are insufficiently varied and developed.</div>
	<div class="p">"The noble education, ethical, social and development principles and goals reflected in the draft resolution before us strengthen our belief that it will enjoy the support of all States, reinforce the status of sport and physical education in all countries and strengthen their role in the consolidation of development and peace, thereby allowing us to give the world's youth genuine grounds for hope."</div>
	<div class="p">It is now my pleasure, on behalf of its 78 sponsors, to present the draft resolution entitled "Sport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.2.pdf">A/58/L.2</a>. The draft resolution was the subject of consultations and deliberations, beginning with the debate held by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on 10 January 2003. A number of changes have been made to the text by several countries and regional and subregional organizations and within the United Nations system. I thank all of them and appreciate their interest in the draft resolution, which they have enriched.</div>
	<div class="p">In particular, I thank Mr. Adolf Ogi, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for Development and Peace, for his efforts to promote the draft. Allow me also to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Mr. Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee, for his tireless efforts to support Olympic principles.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution, in its preambular part, recalls the goals and hopes that our countries place in sport and physical education, along with a number of treaties, conventions and reports that highlight the role of sport and its educational and civilizational role, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other documents of the General Assembly on children, the UNESCO Charter, the 2000 Dakar Framework and several other agreements.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution calls on Governments, the United Nations and other relevant organizations to strengthen the status of sport and physical education in their development policies and to include them as a working tool to achieve development goals, solidarity and cooperation and to promote a culture of peace, dialogue, rapprochement and love among peoples. It also calls on Governments, international sport bodies and sport-related organizations to elaborate and implement partnership initiatives and development projects to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals. It further invites Governments to assist developing countries in their capacity-building efforts in sport and physical education. The draft resolution elaborates a series of procedures whereby sport and physical education can help to achieve a peaceful world and the Olympic ideal. It further stresses the need to implement international anti-doping agreements in all sporting activities.</div>
	<div class="p">The many positive elements of the draft resolution reflect the extreme importance of this international issue. That is why we have accorded a special place to sport and physical education in the draft, which is a keystone document that will offer new prospects and enrich partnership and cooperation for their promotion. We hope that the International Year of Sport and Physical Education and its broad range of activities will help us to achieve the goals elaborated in the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">Tunisia has prepared a preliminary programme in this context and hopes to submit it for discussion. Its elements, including an anti-doping campaign, will help us to achieve all the hopes of the international community with respect to sustainable development. We also believe that sport and physical education could be a tool for the United Nations Environment Programme to achieve its noble goals.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me also to note Tunisia's support for the initiative on the Olympic Truce. The Tunisian and Greek delegations have closely cooperated with a view to ensuring complementarity between that initiative and our draft on the basis of our conviction that sport, physical education and the Olympic principles also serve the same objectives.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, on behalf of the Tunisian delegation and all the other co-sponsors, we express the hope that the draft resolution will enjoy the unanimous support of the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="p">I now call on Mr. George Papandreou, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.9.pdf">A/58/L.9</a>.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="3-7">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Papandreou" nation="Greece" language="">
	Mr. Papandreou (Greece)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It is a great honour for me to take the floor on agenda item 23 (a) in order to introduce the draft resolution entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal".</div>
	<div class="p">The responsibility for this draft resolution traditionally lies with the country hosting the Olympic Games. As members know, less than a year from now Greece will have the privilege of celebrating the homecoming of the greatest peace gathering of our time. The occasion of the 2004 Athens Olympics provides a unique opportunity to rekindle the ancient Greek tradition of Olympic Truce. We want to encourage the notion that it is possible to create lasting peace from a pause in hostilities.</div>
	<div class="p">Promoting peace was, in fact, the actual reason why the Olympic Games were originally established. In antiquity, the implementation of the Olympic Truce entailed a cessation of all hostilities in order to allow thousands of athletes, pilgrims and spectators to travel to Olympia to attend this sacred celebration of human achievement and then return home in safety and security. The Olympic Truce was upheld for over 1,000 years, making it the longest peace treaty in history.</div>
	<div class="p">Bringing the Olympic Truce back to life offers a constructive new approach to conflict resolution. The United Nations, and in particular Secretary-General Kofi Annan, have long championed the value of peaceful cooperation through sport. Since 1993, this Assembly has unanimously adopted six resolutions championing the cause of the Olympic Truce. In that spirit, the Millennium Declaration, adopted in New York in September 2000 by more than 150 Heads of State and Government, included a paragraph on the promotion of peace and mutual understanding through the Olympic Truce. Today's draft resolution, like those before it, calls upon all Member States to observe the Olympic Truce. It is a symbolic call to break the cycle of violence for 16 days during the Olympics and, hopefully, beyond.</div>
	<div class="p">Today, that message could not be more relevant, given the current climate of global insecurity. In our increasingly interdependent yet fractured world, violent conflicts in another part of the world can have serious repercussions in our own neighbourhood. The path to peace must be through mutual understanding, respect and cooperation between cultures, religions and civilizations. The Olympic Truce not only embodies all these values, it provides a means of putting them into practice at the global level. Truce can be a useful tool for diplomacy by providing a vital opportunity for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the promotion of a culture of peace through dialogue and education.</div>
	<div class="p">Making the Olympic Truce a reality in the modern world is a challenging endeavour. To some, it may even seem like a utopian dream. These are difficult times -- times of instability and injustice. We have no illusions as to what we can achieve through the Olympic Truce; it is not a universal remedy that will miraculously heal the rifts that ravage so many regions of the world, but surely, if we can stop even a single conflict, it is worth the effort. While limited in duration, the Olympic Truce can offer an invaluable opportunity for reconciliation, as well as provide respite for the suffering populations in the world's many war zones. By bringing people together across borders and beliefs, regardless of race or creed, it opens up the prospect for longer-lasting peace.</div>
	<div class="p">It is an honour that the President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Mr. Jacques Rogge, is with us today and will give us an address at a later stage in the debate. He and his predecessor, Juan Antonio Samaranch, and the IOC in its totality have continuously promoted the ideal of the Olympic Truce, becoming an inspiration for us all. Here in this Hall, I would also like to thank all the countries that have so enthusiastically embraced this initiative and expressed their support by sponsoring the draft resolution. By this morning, the number of sponsors had reached 189, but the final country, Kiribati, has signed on and we have now reached the unprecedented number, as I am told, of 190 sponsors. This means that the draft resolution is endorsed by the totality of the States Members of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me also to thank the many personalities from around the world -- 400 in all -- who, in their personal capacities, have signed a special statement on promoting the Olympic Truce. Amongst them are world leaders, heads of State and Government, foreign ministers, religious leaders, leaders from the business community and, of course, leaders from the Olympic movement itself. Only yesterday and the day before, the two latest signatures came from President Lula of Brazil and President Toledo of Peru.</div>
	<div class="p">A few moments ago, my colleague, the Minister of Sport of Tunisia, took the floor to introduce the draft resolution entitled "Sport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace". Greece has wholeheartedly co-sponsored that draft resolution. It is vital for the international community to recognize the role sport can play in all dimensions of development.</div>
	<div class="p">As host of the 2004 Olympics, Greece has an acute sense of its responsibility to promote the Olympic ideals. We hope that, next summer, Athens will be a beacon of world peace. To meet that challenge, we look to all of Members for not only for support, but also for guidance. We can be educators by example, so let us reaffirm our commitment to the spirit of peaceful cooperation upon which the Olympics were founded. Let us lay the building blocks of peace one by one, with patience, perseverance and great care. Let us send a symbolic message from this international body of peace to our citizens and the younger generations of the world for a peaceful Olympics and, ultimately, for a more peaceful world. Let us prove that it is possible. For, while conflicts in the world will not cease overnight, if we could have peace for 16 days, then maybe -- just maybe -- we could have it forever.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The General Assembly today is jointly considering two issues that are particularly dear to my heart: "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal" and "Sport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace". The Monaco delegation is a co-sponsor of the two draft resolutions on these topics.</div>
	<div class="p">On 25 October 1993, at the initiative of Egypt -- at that time chairing the Organization of Africa Unity -- the General Assembly adopted <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-48-11">resolution 48/11</a> by which it revived the ancient Greek tradition of the Olympic Truce. I call this to mind because Africa continues to offer the world many of its greatest athletes and because it can demonstrate that sport has a fundamental role to play in the service of development and peace.</div>
	<div class="p">I was privileged to participate as an athlete in five Winter Olympic Games. The most accomplished athletes recognize that the Olympic competition is quite distinct. In addition to striving in an exemplary manner for one's best performance, one has the honour of representing one's country in the world's greatest peaceful, sporting and cultural gathering. In the age of the information society, the Olympic Games represent a showcase open to the entire world. The memory of Korean athletes parading under the single flag of the Korean peninsula at the Sydney Games in 2000 gives us hope for an entire nation and for all the champions of peace.</div>
	<div class="p">Tunisia's initiative "Sport for peace and development: International Year of Sport and Physical Education" is especially timely. Indeed, the Inter-agency Task Force on Sport for Development and Peace -- mandated by the Secretary-General in 2002 to review activities involving sport within the United Nations system and to promote the more systematic and coherent use of sport in development and peace activities -- released the report on its work in August. I pay tribute to the work of the Task Force, which presents sport as a human right and highlights it as a driving force for development and peace and a key element in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</div>
	<div class="p">The report confirms, perhaps redundantly, that the practice of sport is essential to the development of the individual. It should be part of a health regime and a philosophy of life. The practice of sport, however, is much more than that. Sport erases social barriers by making us equal in the face of physical effort. It brings different languages and cultures into contact and brings human beings together, becoming a means of communication and exchange of such essential values as tolerance and perseverance.</div>
	<div class="p">Physical education should be accorded its rightful place in educational systems so as to teach boys and girls alike, at the earliest possible age, to relate to others, respect rules and value effort. Disabled athletes, through their resolve, perseverance and performance, teach us the same lesson. At the same time, we must ensure that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is applied to young athletes whose physical and psychological fragility must be duly taken into account.</div>
	<div class="p">The quest to go beyond oneself, in fraternity and with respect for others, is truly a school of life. The recently established International Olympic Truce Foundation and the International Olympic Truce Centre can and should contribute to disseminating those values. This formidable potential must be exploited. At a time when conflicts persist and the world is disoriented by terrorism, sporting activities can serve as a bridge between peoples, permit dialogue among diverse cultures and rekindle hope.</div>
	<div class="p">Sport is also the mirror of our societies. The Commission on Human Rights Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance recently denounced the rise of racist physical and verbal violence in sport. We must unite against such unacceptable attitudes, which are contrary to the spirit of sport. In that regard, the initiative of the Union of European Football Associations to distribute an anti-racism guidebook to help the football community to counter that evil should be welcomed.</div>
	<div class="p">Another scourge undermining the practice of sport is doping. Like narcotic drug use, doping is a gangrene that must be fought energetically and in exemplary fashion in every sporting activity. On 10 September, the Principality of Monaco signed the Council of Europe's anti-doping Convention and its additional protocol, as well as the European Convention on Spectator Violence and Misbehaviour at Sports Events. It also signed the Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping in Sport, whereby the main sporting federations and almost 80 Governments approved the World Anti-Doping Code on 5 March. We fervently hope that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization will be able to adopt the draft international anti-doping convention for all sporting activities before the twentieth Winter Olympic Games, to take place in Turin in 2006.</div>
	<div class="p">When the States Members of the United Nations, at the initiative of the International Olympic Committee, called 10 years ago for the revival of the Olympic Truce, we committed ourselves to promoting peace and dialogue. That tradition had been respected for more than 1,200 years in the ancient world. I therefore call on all combatants, whatever their underlying motives, to lay down their weapons and to work together with their enemies to find peaceful ways to end their disputes so that the twenty-eighth Olympiad, to take place in August in Athens, Greece -- the cradle of the Olympic movement -- can mark the rebirth of that tradition.</div>
	<div class="p">The almost unanimous sponsorship of the appeal for the Olympic Truce by the States represented in the General Assembly commits us, above and beyond its symbolism, to uniting in order to not to disappoint the peoples of the United Nations.</div>
	</div>

	Mr. Staehelin (Switzerland)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me to begin by expressing my delegation's pleasure at seeing the issue of sport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace being debated by the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. My country also welcomes the fact that the draft resolution on that issue is being discussed in parallel with the draft entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal".</div>
	<div class="p">Those two texts are complementary and in the same spirit. If Member States encouraged their citizens to take a greater part in physical activities, not only would humanity be in better physical condition, but the world would certainly be a more peaceful place. Sport actually offers an ideal means for developing discipline, self-confidence and the qualities of leadership. Sport also teaches the fundamental principles of humanity, such as tolerance, cooperation and respect.</div>
	<div class="p">At the initiative of Mr. Adolf Ogi, the Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace and former President of the Swiss Confederation, who is here with us today, my country organized the Macolin Conference last February. It mobilized key partners from different sectors supporting the new notion of "sport for development" and increased public awareness of the important role that sport can play in cooperation towards development and peace. The Macolin Declaration was adopted by over 380 representatives of 55 countries.</div>
	<div class="p">Switzerland welcomes the Declaration as an appeal to Governments, the United Nations system, sport-related institutions, non-governmental organizations, the sporting industry, the media and public at large to encourage human, social, political and economic development through sport.</div>
	<div class="p">The Macolin Declaration and its recommendations have been a source of inspiration for the United Nations Inter-agency Task-Force on Sport for Development and Peace, led by Mr. Ogi and the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund, Ms. Carol Bellamy. Last September, the working group presented the Secretary-General with its final report, entitled "Sport for Peace and Development: Towards Achieving the Millennium Development Goals".</div>
	<div class="p">The facts highlighted in the report are evident. On a global scale, physical inactivity directly accounts for 1.9 million deaths and indirectly contributes to sickness and death due to arterial hypertension, high cholesterol levels and obesity. It is estimated that every dollar spent towards physical activity could save $3.20's worth of medical expenses. Sport is a catalyst for economic development. On a global scale, the sporting industry is valued at about $36 billion, with an estimated annual increase of 3 to 5 per cent.</div>
	<div class="p">On the other hand, it also tells us that children aged 6 to 12 who take part in at least five hours of physical activity per week get better grades than those who take part in less than one hour per week. Studies in 126 countries show physical education's nearly universal marginalization. Why? Physical education is often considered to be a non-productive or non-intellectual activity and, consequently, not essential to education.</div>
	<div class="p">Sports can also contribute to breaking down social barriers and can serve as an effective tool in conflict prevention, thereby contributing to peace. Consequently, sports should be better integrated into development programmes.</div>
	<div class="p">The aim of the draft resolution being discussed today is to encourage Governments, sports-related organizations and non-governmental organizations to strengthen their cooperation in the areas of sports and development and also to encourage the United Nations to develop strategic partnerships with all actors in this field, including with sports associations and bodies and the private sector, in order to contribute to the implementation of sports programmes for development.</div>
	<div class="p">As host to the International Olympic Committee and several other world sports associations headquarters, Switzerland fully supports the idea of an international year for sport and physical education.</div>

	Mr. Zhang Yishan (China)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Sport, being a common language of humankind, is an important factor in the promotion of peace and development. Since ancient times, sport has transcended racial and cultural differences and has given expression to humankind's aspiration to, and pursuit of, a peaceful and better world, as evidenced in the Olympic spirit, which came into being more than 2,000 years ago.</div>
	<div class="p">Since Mr. Pierre de Coubertin founded the modern Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century, the peoples of the world have remained unshaken in their resolve to pursue the Olympic ideal. The founding of the United Nations and the establishment of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, while contributing to the maintenance of world peace and social development, also facilitated the spread and further development of the Olympic spirit.</div>
	<div class="p">The Chinese delegation believes that in the twenty-first century, countries of the world should continue to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and actively advocate the Olympic spirit, so as to enhance dialogue and exchanges among civilizations and to promote steady global economic and social progress.</div>
	<div class="p">Sport and physical education are activities undertaken in the context of humankind's ceaseless pursuit of the Olympic ideal. Sport not only builds one's physique but also teaches communication, cooperation, respect for others and acceptance of failure. As such, it is an important medium for strengthening ties among different civilizations as well as their common values.</div>
	<div class="p">We support consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 23 entitled "International Year of Sport and Physical Education" during this session of the General Assembly and would like to thank the Permanent Mission of Tunisia for its initiative in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government and the people of China have always admired the purposes and principles of the Olympic spirit and supported the efforts made in the context of the Olympics to promote world peace. Even as we speak, the Chinese Government and the Chinese people are doing their utmost to prepare for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, in hopes of making it a grand gathering that will carry forward the Olympic spirit, promote world peace and enhance friendship among peoples of the world, so that the Olympic spirit will flourish once again, this time in China, an oriental country with an ancient civilization.</div>
	<div class="p">The XXVIII Olympiad will be held next year in Athens, Greece. It is of great significance that the Olympic Games will be returning to their place of origin after more than 100 years. We wholeheartedly wish the Athens Olympics every success.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, allow me to conclude my statement with a quotation from the address by Foreign Minister Papandreou of Greece in this year's general debate:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Let us reaffirm our commitment to the spirit of peaceful cooperation upon which the Olympics were founded. Let us send a symbolic message from this international body of peace for a peaceful Olympics and, ultimately, for a more peaceful world."

	<div class="p">The Government of Israel is proud to lend its support to the draft resolution entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal", and would like also to take this opportunity to congratulate Greece, the host country of the 2004 Olympic Games.</div>
	<div class="p">Israel is of the view that athletic competition, undertaken in a spirit of mutual respect, fairness and good sportsmanship, is an ideal way to foster goodwill and good relations between peoples. The values of sports are universal and transcend national boundaries; they provide a medium through which diverse peoples can interact and promote greater understanding of one another.</div>
	<div class="p">In our own region, we have tried to harness the power of sports to forge relationships and to build bridges across the dark waters of conflict. We hope that these types of competitions will continue to develop and expand in the future.</div>
	<div class="p">The Olympic Games, as the world's premier sporting event, have long been one of the primary meeting points for nations divided by politics or geography. In that respect, we support the observance of the Olympic Truce, as an expression of our common yearning for peace and reconciliation, and we hope that all Member States will join together in ensuring that peace and security prevail for the duration of the Games.</div>
	<div class="p">Unfortunately, for the people of Israel, the idea of the Olympic Games cannot be separated from the memory of the horrific act that tarnished the 1972 Games in Munich, when gunmen from the terrorist group Black September broke into the Olympic Village disguised as athletes and killed 11 Israeli athletes, coaches and referees.</div>
	<div class="p">That disgraceful act of terrorism and murder, unprecedented in the annals of Olympic history, is the very antithesis of the Olympic ideal. The Games, rather than being allowed to transcend politics and conflict, were used as a vehicle for the expression of hatred and the perpetration of murder.</div>
	<div class="p">That blemish on the history of the Games must not be forgotten, as we strive to ensure that future Olympic events serve to broaden understanding, deepen tolerance and respect, and promote peace. The prominence of a movement is reflected not only in its endeavours but also in its capacity to mourn those of its members who have perished for the principles it wishes to promote. It is therefore unfortunate that, still today, the International Olympic Committee has not found an appropriate manner to officially observe the memory of the fallen Israeli athletes.</div>
	<div class="p">Israel reaffirms its support for the noble objectives of the draft resolution and for the observance of the Olympic Truce. The Olympic Games is one of the world's only truly global events, and as such presents us with an extraordinary opportunity to focus the world's attention and utilize the good will that the Games inspire to build a more peaceful and more harmonious world.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It gives me great pleasure to address the Assembly today on the issue of the Olympic Truce, that is to say, the idea that humankind can achieve a universally conflict-free environment, even for a limited period of time. The warmest congratulations must be extended to the impressive and laudable efforts made by the Foreign Minister of Greece, Mr. George Papandreou, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Mr. Jacques Rogge, to make this endeavour a reality.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish very briefly to reiterate Cyprus's strong support for the concept of the Olympic Truce, which could be the prelude to a world free of hate, armed conflict and acts of aggression, as described in the comprehensive draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-58-L.9.pdf">A/58/L.9</a>) that has been introduced by Greece and will serve as a decisive milestone in our efforts to move in that direction.</div>
	<div class="p">In the same spirit, we welcome the draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-58-L.2.pdf">A/58/L.2</a>) submitted by Tunisia under the same agenda item, which appropriately draws attention to the intimate link between sport, peace and development. Particularly auspicious are the references to the contribution of physical education to the welfare of children and to the need to intensify efforts to combat doping on an international level and utilize sport as a means to enhance health awareness and build a culture of peace.</div>
	<div class="p">Sport, peace, culture, humanism and respect for universal ethical principles are indeed the quintessential ideals of Olympism. The invaluable contribution of the Olympic Games to the human spirit and to civilization has been evident since the Games were first held in 776 BC at the sacred site of Olympia in honour of the Olympian God Zeus. Cyprus is proud to have been part of the Olympic ideal since its inception, with Cypriot athletes consistently competing in the Games at Olympia.</div>
	<div class="p">The sacred tradition of <i>ekecheiria,</i> or Olympic Truce, was also born in the eighth century BC and lasted for twelve centuries. It was observed for 7 days before the beginning, and 7 days after the end, of the Games, in order to allow athletes, spectators and all others to safely travel to and from Olympia. The Olympic Truce was the incarnation of the lofty ideals enshrined in the Olympic Games.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like unreservedly to support the appeal enshrined in the Millennium Declaration to observe the Olympic Truce as a matter of tradition. In that way, each country organizing the Olympic Games in the future could make it an imperative for the Truce to be honoured in every Olympiad by introducing the present draft resolution into the General Assembly on a biennial basis before the holding of both the winter and summer Games.</div>
	<div class="p">While the rationale for the excellent draft resolution we have before us has to do with conflict conditions significantly different from those that prevailed in antiquity, the aspiration of humankind remains remarkably similar, namely, the termination of all acts of hostility as well as the peaceful settlement of international conflicts. What has eluded us for so long is achievable, even if briefly, and, even under hostile circumstances, what unites us can be stronger than the reasons for fighting each other. This first step can greatly contribute to the creation of an irresistible dynamic for peace and reconciliation and for the search of means other than war and violence to resolve differences. Indeed, the educational value of teaching through good example is at the very heart of the philosophy of Olympism.</div>
	<div class="p">As a demonstration of our inherent belief in the unifying power of all manifestations of culture, and especially sports, I would like, on behalf of my Government, to wish the very best to everyone involved in the realization of this ambitious project.</div>

	<div class="p">My delegation is honoured to welcome the two draft resolutions (<a href="../pdf/A-58-L.2.pdf">A/58/L.2</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.9.pdf">A/58/L.9</a>) being considered by the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session under sub-items (a) and (b) -- entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal" and "International Year of Sport and Physical Education", respectively -- of agenda item 23, entitled "Sport for peace and development".</div>
	<div class="p">To everyone's satisfaction, the draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-58-L.9.pdf">A/58/L.9</a>) entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal", which was introduced by the representative of Greece, as the country hosting the next Olympic Games, restores the essential element removed from the previous resolution on the subject by urging all Member States to observe the Olympic Truce during the Games that will be held from 13 to 29 August 2004 and to use the Truce as an instrument to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation during the Games and thereafter. We are pleased that 190 countries have now become sponsors of the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">The second draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-58-L.2.pdf">A/58/L.2</a>), entitled "Sport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace", which was introduced by the representative of Tunisia, focuses on the importance of physical education and sport as ways of promoting peace, development and friendly relations among nations. At the same time, the draft resolution aims at accelerating the drafting of an international anti-doping convention and proclaims the year 2005 the International Year of Sport and Physical Education as a means of promoting peace and development.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation reaffirms that sport and the Olympic ideal undoubtedly contribute to strengthening friendship and brotherhood among peoples, which are vital elements in the promotion of development, peace and cooperation among nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Cuba welcomes the fact that the 2004 Olympic Games will be held in Athens, Greece, where the Olympiad originated and where the tradition of declaring the Olympic Truce began. The delegation of Cuba trusts that those Olympic Games will follow the path of comradeship in sport in a spirit of healthy competition devoid of cheating, excessive commercialization, doping or the kidnapping of athletes. My delegation hopes that this event will mark an important step forward in the history of the international sports movement. Cuban athletes are working with rigour and dedication to prepare themselves for participation in this new Olympic cycle, in keeping with the high level that Cuban sport has achieved in recent years.</div>
	<div class="p">It is regrettable that some of our athletes will not be able to go to Athens for reasons having nothing to do with sport. This is true of the Cuban national archery team, which was prevented from taking part in the world championship of that discipline in New York in July of this year -- a classifying competition for the great event -- when visas were denied to two members of the group in outright violation of the Olympic Charter. This is not an isolated event.</div>
	<div class="p">I would remind you that in just under 11 months, United States visas have been denied to 39 Cuban athletes who were due to participate in various international events, including the World Cup Wrestling Championship held in Boise, Idaho in April 2003. The sporting sphere has not escaped being caught in the net of measures that make up the economic, trade and financial blockade imposed by the United States on Cuba, something that has been vigorously rejected by the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">Sport in Cuba is a right of the people and is free of charge. Today more than 1.5 million citizens regularly engage in sports or physical exercise under the guidance of a professional. More than 2 million children, teenagers and young students are taught physical education and sports by their teachers. For the elderly, pregnant women and other groups of citizens, physical exercise means good health, a longer life and a better quality of life.</div>
	<div class="p">In our country over the years, more than 30,000 people have earned a degree to teach physical education and sports. Eight thousand Cuban sports professionals and trainers have provided services in dozens of countries, whose athletes have, on occasion, then competed and won against our athletes. Moreover, the Cuban Government is helping to bolster sports in countries of the third world. Evidence of this is provided by the International School of Physical Education and Sport, whose students are young people from more than 50 such countries and who will graduate as qualified professionals in various areas of sport.</div>
	<div class="p">President Fidel Castro has said,</div>
	<div class="p">"Sport is well-being. It is a standard of living, it is health, it is joy and honour for the people, and is perhaps the most effective instrument to combat criminal tendencies, drugs and many other vices that beset modern societies."</div>
	<div class="p">In the sphere of sport, cooperation, respect and equality must prevail, and not the globalization of injustice and inequality. Given this, we shall be able to advance towards the genuine Olympic idea.</div>

	<div class="p">Mankind needs today, more than ever before, to make strenuous efforts to achieve harmony among peoples and international peace and security based on justice and equality in rights and duties.</div>
	<div class="p">In the context of this constant effort, we must have recourse to history to inform us and prove to us the possibility of conciliation and harmony among all peoples on Earth.</div>
	<div class="p">The Greeks and all other ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians, Romans and Arabs, have offered enriching contributions to our world. I mention in particular the philosophy of unifying people through an organized Olympics, under a flag whose circles symbolize peace and unity among all peoples and continents.</div>
	<div class="p">Today, more than ever, we need to promote the value of peace. The world is divided between opponents and supporters of wars and conflicts that affect all continents and races. The gap is increasing between the rich and the poor; diseases are devastating the poor, who have no one to help them, and civilizations and religions are not converging, but diverging. In the midst of all of this, sports will remain the single most ideal environment where barriers can be ignored and hatred among enemies can be left behind.</div>
	<div class="p">Every four years, the world is united during the Olympics and everyone perceives the lack of differences among people. The new generation is optimistic, owing to the spirit of tolerance that prevails during the month when the Olympic flame is visible as a symbol of the ability of man to realize peace and to defy all negativity. At that time, tears of victory mingle with feelings of defeat and everybody feels proud of the humanity that has brought them together and has deepened in them a love of life and construction and has urged them to abandon killing and destruction. Given our belief in these ideals and values and given our ancient civilization based on peace and justice, Egypt has co-sponsored the Greek draft resolution on the Olympic ideal, which embodies all the noble objectives. Egypt also supports the Tunisian draft resolution on the International Year of Sport and Physical Education. We note that these draft resolutions are in conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">We call on all peoples of the world to be inspired by the objectives of the Olympics and sports as a way to realize permanent peace, justice, equality, universal well-being and freedom from wars and conflicts that have left a legacy of feelings of deprivation and hatred.</div>
	<div class="p">When competition increases and records fall and countries pursue athletic glory and strive only for the symbols of the fittest, the strongest, the fastest runner and the highest jumper, eventually the value of peace becomes entrenched and continuity among peoples and generations prevails.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Gilman" nation="United States" language="">
	Mr. Gilman (United States)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Building a peaceful and better world is the underlying principle of the United Nations Charter. Usually, the United Nations does that by considering issues related to peace and security, sustainable development, human rights and humanitarian assistance. Today, we are considering how to build a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal.</div>
	<div class="p">My name is Benjamin Gilman. During my 30 years of service in the United States House of Representatives, I was able to serve as Chairman of our Committee on International Relations for some six years. I have the honour of serving on the United States delegation to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session from the public at large. One of the purposes of such a role -- according to Eleanor Roosevelt, who established the tradition -- is to bring the perspective and experience of the American public directly to the Assembly's consideration of matters that affect us all.</div>
	<div class="p">The United States delegation is honoured to note the presence today of the Foreign Minister of Greece, Mr. George Papandreou; the President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Mr. Jacques Rogge, and other members of the IOC; the President of the United States Olympic Committee, Mr. James Scherr; the Minister for Sport of Tunisia, Mr. Abderrahim Zouari; other key figures of the Olympic movement; distinguished colleagues from Member States; and other dignitaries. We are grateful for their participation in today's activities. I should also like to note that there are several Olympians in this Hall today.</div>
	<div class="p">As all Olympic competitors recognize, records are meant to be broken. The number of sponsors of the worthy draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-58-L.9.pdf">A/58/L.9</a>) before us -- 191 -- also breaks a record, exceeding the number of sponsors of its predecessors and indeed of any other draft resolution in the Organization's history. That is truly an Olympic feat of the first order.</div>
	<div class="p">Although in its modern form, the Olympic Truce initiative is only 10 years old, it revives the ancient principle honoured among States of ensuring the safe passage of all concerned to Olympia and their participation in the Games. The United States delegation has joined in sponsoring the Assembly's adoption of five previous draft resolutions in this vein: prior to the Olympic Games held at Lillehammer, Atlanta, Nagano, Sydney and Salt Lake City. My country's delegation enthusiastically joins in the consensus today, on the eve of the Athens Olympics. Athletes pledge their honour to uphold the values of fair play and honest competition. The draft resolution before us and today's consensus are fostering a similar pledge: to reinforce the scope and the power of the Olympic movement, linking athletes of the twenty-first century with those of ancient Greece.</div>
	<div class="p">The United States is highly pleased about the return of the Olympic Games to Athens. Since the revival of the modern Olympic Games, in Athens in 1896, the United States has hosted the Olympics on eight occasions. The Olympic ideal is realized visibly in the spirit of goodwill. For example, some 27,000 volunteers made the Salt Lake City Olympics a success. In a similar expression of goodwill, the United States looks forward to hosting the Olympic movement in the future. In the year 2012, New York City will have served as host city to the United Nations for nearly 67 years. Our hopes are high that at that time, New York City will also host the Games of the thirtieth Olympiad. Excitement is running high about its bid, and particularly about the fact that, on 19 June 2004, the Olympic torch will pass through the streets of this city and in front of United Nations Headquarters en route to Athens.</div>
	<div class="p">However, what precisely has been the Olympic ideal? The Olympic ideal goes beyond victories and records to fair play, friendship and, ultimately, peace. The Olympic ideal connotes international understanding among our young people through sport and culture. It goes beyond sports competition to embrace intercultural and humanitarian activities as well. The goal of Olympism is to place sports at the service of man's harmonious development everywhere, with a view to encouraging the establishment of a peaceful society that is concerned with the preservation of human dignity. It was in 1894 that Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, predicted that the new modern Olympics would eventually become both a symbol and the centrepiece of a new global era of unity among all nations. Today's reaffirmation of the Olympic Truce recommits the nations of the world to that global aspiration at the heart of the Olympic ideal.</div>
	<div class="p">In that spirit, the people of the United States know and daily live out the positive role that sports can play towards a peaceful and better world. We believe in the Olympic ideal, and we encourage those -- the athletes, the coaches, the families and the organizations -- who work daily to make it a reality. Through sports, one learns about fair play, mutual understanding, solidarity and friendship. Those are the very virtues that the United Nations strives to embody in its work and as an example to the world community.</div>
	<div class="p">But let us be more specific. What are the significant benefits of sports for the youth of the world? People who are involved in sports better themselves and their societies. It has been proved that young people who engage in sports are more likely to join an athletic team than to join a gang; they are more likely to stay in school; they are more likely to make responsible decisions in favour of clean lives and away from drugs and other dangers; and they are more likely to go on to higher education. The results are solid and impressive.</div>
	<div class="p">Sports help us to meet the human-centred development goals proposed by recent United Nations global conferences. A symbolic reminder of that is the flying of the United Nations flag at the Olympic Games. But there are more concrete aspects. The United Nations system has worked in partnership with the IOC on many humanitarian fronts to promote, through sports, the quality of life and well-being of those living in the most disadvantaged circumstances. There are children in refugee camps, in displacement, in onerous labour conditions, in wars and other conflicts, in severe poverty and urban violence.</div>
	<div class="p">The IOC's International Cooperation and Development Department has initiated programmes worldwide for the world's young people. For example, they address stress in refugee camps through organized basketball tournaments. With IOC charitable assistance, war-ravaged sports facilities are rebuilt; coaching clinics teach the rules of fair play, tolerance and understanding; and equipment is provided to those who are in need. Much is done in cooperation with, inter alia, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Development Programme.</div>
	<div class="p">Notably, the Olympic Solidarity Fund established by the IOC is spending over $0.2 billion between 2001 and 2004 for the development of sport scholarships for underprivileged athletes in developing countries. Today's adoption of this Greek-initiated draft resolution is a solemn moment in that it is essentially a humanitarian action.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations increasingly attests to the unifying power of sport. When the family of nations sometimes finds agreement difficult, it is nonetheless able to agree to come together in peaceful competition. For example, just two days ago on its lawn outside of this Hall, thousands of marathoners arrived for a spirited rally and friendship run to Central Park as a warm-up to Sunday's New York City Marathon, which included more than 30,000 athletes.</div>
	<div class="p">The Olympic Truce goes right to the heart of the philosophy of the Olympic Movement. The International Olympic Truce Foundation and its Centre, located in Athens, are the nexus for promulgating Olympism to mean more than just a medal count. I am pleased to recall that in 2001 my colleagues in the United States Senate adopted a resolution supporting the Olympic Truce with the same spirit that animates supporters of the Foundation. Through American philanthropy, a 22-foot-tall bronze statue entitled "The Olympic Truce" is being planned for presentation in Athens early next year. Since Olympism seeks to educate youth through sports and culture, that artistic gift will become an icon to that end.</div>
	<div class="p">Whether as athletes or spectators, when we meet at and participate in international sporting events, we share in the glow of world-class competition, whether it be in the heartbreak of losing or in the glory of winning, but most importantly, in the goodwill of participation. Sports are truly global activities that extend into the lives of all people, whether they be rich or poor, at peace or at war. International competitions, such as the Olympic Games, encourage all of our nations to set aside their differences in the spirit of fair play. They provide everyone with a venue for cultural exchange and an opportunity to share national traditions and customs. Today's draft resolution enables our General Assembly to underscore the fact that good sportsmanship promotes a worldwide culture of peace, tolerance and understanding, particularly among our young people. As Member States, we set a powerful example to the youth of the world in swearing this Olympic Truce today.</div>
	<div class="p">The United States would like to note its thoughts concerning the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.2.pdf">A/58/L.2</a> on the International Year of Sport and Physical Education. Concerning the reference to the Millennium Development Goals, we should like to note that world leaders at the Millennium Summit, the Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development and the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development agreed to support the internationally-agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration. Those internationally-agreed goals articulate a balanced partnership for development that is missing in the Millennium Development Goals.</div>
	<div class="p">However, while we do support Tunisia's worthy goals with reference to the proposed anti-doping convention, our nation does have some reservations with regard to references to that proposed convention. We believe that it would be far better to approach that issue with care in order not to undermine or duplicate current efforts against the abuse of drugs in sports.</div>
	<div class="p">As I am learning from my colleagues here today, both sports and diplomacy seek to reinforce friendship between peoples, and fair play means involving players with various interests and abilities on a level playing field. In closing, let me note that, indeed, the Olympic ideal is a hymn to tolerance and understanding between all peoples and cultures. It is an invitation to competition, but competition with respect for others. In its ideals, Olympism is a school for democracy.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. ElBaradei" nation="" language="">
	Mr. ElBaradei
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The past year has been a time of significant challenges and achievements for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In the area of nuclear non-proliferation, the Agency has been at the centre of attention and has demonstrated its ability to perform objective and credible verification, but we continue to face a number of difficult and unresolved situations. In the area of nuclear safety and security, our work is making a difference and we see overall improvement, but much remains to be done. In the nuclear technology field, the Agency is contributing to sustainable development through its technical cooperation programme, with the benefits of nuclear applications increasingly recognized. And, while nuclear power continues to hold great potential as an environmentally clean source of energy, it remains in a holding position due to a number of associated concerns. Today is an opportunity for me to review in more detail some of the Agency's activities in each of these areas.</div>
	<div class="p">In the field of nuclear power, the urgent need for sustained human development will clearly necessitate increases in the supply of energy in the coming decades. In recent years, nuclear power has supplied about 16 per cent of world electricity production and it remains the only energy source that can provide electricity on a large scale with comparatively minimal impact on the environment.</div>
	<div class="p">Of the 33 power reactors currently under construction, 20 are in Asia. In other regions, the more immediate focus is on power upgrades, restarts of previously shutdown reactors and license extensions. For example, in the United States of America, 16 reactors have had their operating licenses extended to 60 years and many more applications are under review.</div>
	<div class="p">The long-term prospects for nuclear power, however, will depend on the industry's success in addressing concerns associated with waste disposal, proliferation, safety and security, while also improving the economic competitiveness of future reactors. Nearly 20 IAEA member States are currently involved in projects to develop reactor and fuel cycle designs that would address some of these concerns, and a number of countries are also exploring the nuclear co-generation of hydrogen to address demands for cleaner energy in the transportation sector.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the technical cooperation programmes of the IAEA, nuclear applications are gaining increasing importance as tools for social and economic development.</div>
	<div class="p">In the field of human health, the number of new cancer cases per year in the developing world is expected to double to 10 million by 2015 as life expectancy increases and lifestyles change. However, most developing countries do not have sufficient numbers of health professionals or radiotherapy machines to treat their cancer patients effectively. Indeed, some 15 African nations and several countries in Asia lack even one radiation therapy machine. The Agency has been working with key partners, such as the World Health Organization, to provide training, expert missions and equipment to support national and regional radiotherapy programmes, as well as projects in nuclear medicine, nutrition studies and many other health-related areas. A highly visible result of Agency support across Africa has been an increase of approximately 35 per cent over the past five years in the number of cancer patients receiving treatment in participating countries of the African Regional Cooperative Agreement -- an increase of approximately 6,500 patients per year.</div>
	<div class="p">In the field water resources management, more than one sixth of the world's population lives in areas without adequate access to safe drinking water, a situation that is expected to worsen significantly unless the international community takes prompt and effective action. Isotope hydrology is being used in more than 80 Agency projects to map underground aquifers, manage surface water and groundwater, detect and control pollution, and monitor dam leakage and safety. For example, an ongoing regional isotope hydrology project in Latin America has brought together more than 30 water institutes to address water shortages, with the successful completion of conceptual models for a total of seven aquifers in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Peru.</div>
	<div class="p">For many years, the Agency has been working with Member States on mutation breeding of major food crops that yield very well in different ecological conditions. One example is the improvement in rice varieties in the Asia and Pacific region. In a harvesting ceremony in August, the Indonesian Government gave recognition to the positive and sustained economic impact of a variety of rice with higher yield and better quality, produced using gamma rays, which has successfully been introduced in 20 Indonesian provinces. We anticipate the release of at least seven new varieties of rice in the region during the next three to five years.</div>
	<div class="p">The Agency's technical cooperation programme provides about $80 million of assistance per year and continues to be a principal mechanism for implementing the Agency's basic mission: "Atoms for peace". The Secretariat continues to work on measures to ensure that technical cooperation projects such as those I have just mentioned achieve lasting and concrete benefits to recipient member States. Efforts are proceeding to improve the planning of national technical cooperation strategies through early and direct dialogue with member States, to ensure strong Government commitment and to focus on fewer but higher quality projects. We have expanded our monitoring of the impact of technical cooperation projects in order to increase project quality, relevance, effectiveness and sustainability, and we continue to build and expand partnerships with other international organizations and development partners with a view towards leveraging the Agency's limited resources, attracting greater attention to the benefits of nuclear technologies, and, in some cases, drawing on the technical expertise of other organizations to enhance the impact of a nuclear technique.</div>
	<div class="p">The safety and security of nuclear activities around the globe remain a key factor for the future of nuclear technology. It is gratifying to note that nuclear safety continues to improve at nuclear power plants worldwide, that more countries are raising their standards of performance in radiation protection and that significant steps have been taken in the past two years to improve nuclear security.</div>
	<div class="p">One area that still needs improvement involves learning from past experience. When events occur at nuclear facilities, it is essential that such operating experiences -- the lessons learned -- be properly communicated to other relevant nuclear facilities and, as applicable, be incorporated into their operational practices. This remains an area of current focus.</div>
	<div class="p">The development and adoption of legally-binding norms has proven to be a powerful mechanism for enhancing safety worldwide. The Conventions on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency continue to serve as mechanisms for Agency response missions to States parties during emergencies. The Agency is increasing its involvement in the Convention on Nuclear Safety by reporting, as requested, on the trends and issues observed during our various safety missions, and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management has now been in force for over two years. However, many States are not yet party to these conventions and certain key areas of the nuclear fuel cycle are still not subject to conventions.</div>
	<div class="p">One convention that has gained increased attention recently is the 1979 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. In the past two years, 20 additional States have become parties to the Convention, reflecting the importance of the international nuclear security regime. States are now working on a much-needed amendment to broaden the scope of the Convention, that I hope will be adopted soon.</div>
	<div class="p">I am also pleased to report good progress in the continuing revision and updating of international nuclear safety standards. Upgrades to all existing Agency standards should be completed by late next year. Over the next three to four years, we hope to fill in the remaining gaps in coverage -- such as safety standards on geological waste repositories -- and to implement a more coherent structure for the body of IAEA standards. Those standards should be accepted and implemented worldwide as the global reference for nuclear and radiation safety.</div>
	<div class="p">The Agency's safety review and appraisal services assist member States in the application of IAEA safety standards and provide useful feedback on their effectiveness. These services originated predominantly in the field of nuclear installation safety, but now extend to cover many areas of radiation, radioactive waste and transport safety as well. I should note that, in particular, safety services and assistance to countries of Central and Eastern Europe operating power reactors have been at the centre of the technical cooperation programmes of those countries for the past decade, resulting in a broad and significant positive impact on the operational safety of those facilities. Demand for Agency services continues to be very strong. The Agency's annual report for 2002 lists more than 60 safety missions of various types to 29 States. Collectively, the results of the services constitute a substantial body of safety experience from around the world.</div>
	<div class="p">Agency efforts to help member States improve their protection against nuclear and radiological terrorism are continuing at an exceptionally fast pace on multiple fronts. Since September 2001, working in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa, we have conducted nearly 40 advisory and evaluation missions and convened more than 50 training courses, workshops and seminars. The IAEA also has strengthened its cooperation on nuclear security issues with other international organizations, including the United Nations and its specialized agencies, Interpol, Europol, the Universal Postal Union and the European Commission.</div>
	<div class="p">Despite the increased attention given to the security of radioactive sources since 11 September 2001, some deficiencies remain. Information in the Agency's database of illicit trafficking, combined with reports of discoveries of plans for radiological dispersal devices -- so-called dirty bombs -- make it clear that a market continues to exist for obtaining and using radioactive sources for malevolent purposes. Agency evaluation missions have been held throughout Eastern Europe, Africa and Central America to assess member States' capabilities to detect nuclear and other radioactive material at their borders and to help them respond to illicit trafficking. In the past year, IAEA missions to a number of States have assisted in the recovery, characterization and securing of radioactive sources seized in trafficking incidents. The Agency will continue its efforts to improve source safety and security.</div>
	<div class="p">Events of the past year have placed the nuclear non-proliferation regime under stress on multiple fronts and have made it clear that concrete steps to strengthen the regime are urgently required. The Agency's role as an independent, objective verification body remains central to the effectiveness of the regime.</div>
	<div class="p">The IAEA's verification activities are designed to provide assurance that nuclear material and facilities are used exclusively for peaceful purposes. In the early 1990s, after the discovery of the clandestine nuclear-weapons programme in Iraq, the international community committed itself to providing the Agency with the authority to strengthen its verification capability -- specifically, its ability to provide assurance not only that declared nuclear material has not been diverted for non-peaceful purposes, but, equally important, that no undeclared nuclear material or activities exist.</div>
	<div class="p">This broader authority, however, is still far from universal. Regrettably, 46 States have yet to fulfil their legal obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to bring safeguards agreements with the Agency into force and, more than six years after the IAEA Board's approval of the Model Additional Protocol, over 150 countries still do not have an additional protocol in force. I strongly urge all States that have not done so to conclude and bring into force the required safeguards agreements and additional protocols at an early date. As I have repeatedly stated, if the Agency is to provide the required assurances, it must have the required authority.</div>
	<div class="p">The situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continues to pose a serious and immediate challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Since December 2002, the Agency has not performed any verification activities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and cannot therefore provide any level of assurance about the non-diversion of nuclear material. We have continued to emphasize the need for a comprehensive settlement of the Korean crisis through dialogue, and it is my hope that the six-party talks will lead to such a settlement. I trust that any future settlement will ensure, inter alia, the return of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and that the Agency will be given the necessary authority and resources to be able to fulfil its responsibilities under the NPT in a credible manner.</div>
	<div class="p">After an interruption of nearly four years, last November the Agency resumed verification activities in Iraq under the mandate provided by Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991)">resolution 687 (1991)</a> and related resolutions. Between November 2002 and March 2003, the Agency sought to determine what, if anything, had changed in Iraq over the previous four years relevant to Iraq's nuclear activities and capabilities. At the time the Agency ceased its Security Council verification activities in Iraq, we had found no evidence of the revival of nuclear activities prohibited under relevant Security Council resolutions. However, considering our four-year absence, the time available for the renewed inspections was not sufficient for the Agency to complete its overall review and assessment.</div>
	<div class="p">The Agency's mandate in Iraq under various Security Council resolutions still stands. In May, the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a> in which, inter alia, it expressed its intention to revisit the mandates of the IAEA and the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission. We are awaiting the results of that review and further guidance from the Council. Given the situation in Iraq, I believe it would be prudent for the United Nations and IAEA inspectors to return to Iraq, to bring the weapons file to a closure and, through implementation of a Security Council-approved plan for long-term monitoring, to provide ongoing assurance that activities related to weapons of mass destruction have not been resumed. In the meantime, I trust that the Agency will be kept informed of the outcome of any current inspection activities in Iraq relevant to our mandate, pursuant to Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1441(2002).pdf">resolution 1441 (2002)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Pursuant to the mandate given to me by the IAEA General Conference, I have continued to consult with the States of the Middle East region on the application of full-scope safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East and on the development of model agreements relevant to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the region. I regret to report that, due to the prevailing situation in the region, I have not been in a position to make any progress on the implementation of this important mandate, which is of direct relevance to non-proliferation and security in the Middle East. With the active cooperation of all concerned, I hope to move this mandate forward in the coming year. It is essential, in my view, that a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East be accompanied by a regional security structure that includes the establishment of the Middle East as a zone free from weapons of mass destruction. In my view, a durable peace will not be attained without an adequate security structure, which in turn is difficult to achieve without a peaceful settlement. The two must go hand in hand.</div>
	<div class="p">The Board of Governors this year has given considerable attention to the implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In September, the Board adopted a resolution urging Iran to show proactive and accelerated cooperation and to demonstrate full transparency by providing the Agency with a declaration of all its nuclear activities. The Board made clear that it was essential and urgent for all outstanding issues to be brought to closure as soon as possible in order to enable the Agency to provide the required assurances.</div>
	<div class="p">Recently, we have received what the Iranian authorities have said is a full and accurate declaration of Iran's past and current nuclear activities and are in the process of verifying that declaration. Iran has also expressed its intention to conclude an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement, which is key to our ability to provide comprehensive assurances. I will report to the IAEA Board later this month on the status of our implementation of safeguards in Iran.</div>
	<div class="p">Looking forward, it is clear that the Agency must have the required authority, information and resources to be able to provide the international community with the credible non-proliferation assurances required under the NPT. In that context, the international community must work hard to achieve the universality of the regime. We must also be more assertive in resolving the root causes of global insecurity -- such as long-standing regional conflicts and other causes of instability -- which provide incentives for the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. And we must work together to develop and establish a system of collective security that does not depend on nuclear weapons and accelerate the process of nuclear disarmament.</div>
	<div class="p">Recent events have made it clear that the non-proliferation regime is under growing stress. The current world situation is different in many respects from that of the late 1960s, when the NPT was being negotiated. A key difference is that information and expertise on how to produce nuclear weapons has become much more accessible. This places extra emphasis on the importance of controlling access to weapon-usable nuclear material.</div>
	<div class="p">In light of the increasing threat of proliferation, both by States and by terrorists, one idea that may now be worth serious consideration is the advisability of limiting the processing of weapon-usable material -- that is, separated plutonium and high enriched uranium -- in civilian nuclear programmes, as well as the production of new material through reprocessing and enrichment, by agreeing to restrict those operations exclusively to facilities under multinational control. Such limitations would naturally need to be accompanied by appropriate rules of assurance of supply for would-be users.</div>
	<div class="p">We should equally consider multinational approaches to the management and disposal of spent fuel and radioactive waste. Over 50 countries currently have spent fuel stored in temporary locations, awaiting reprocessing or disposal. Not all countries have the appropriate geological conditions for such disposal and, for many countries with small nuclear programmes, the financial and human resources required for the construction and operation of a geological disposal facility are simply daunting. Taken together, these proposals, in my view, would provide enhanced assurance to the international community that the sensitive portions of civilian nuclear fuel-cycle programmes are not vulnerable to misuse.</div>
	<div class="p">The Agency continues to play a key role in ensuring that the benefits of nuclear technology are shared globally for economic and social development, that nuclear activities are conducted safely, that nuclear and radioactive materials and facilities are adequately protected, and that a credible inspection regime exists to verify compliance with non-proliferation commitments.</div>
	<div class="p">This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the "Atoms for peace" speech delivered before this body by President Eisenhower, in which he articulated a vision, shared by many world leaders, that would enable humanity to make full use of the benefits of nuclear energy while minimizing its risk. That vision led to the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Much has changed since that time and I believe it is appropriate for us to take stock of our successes and failures and to resolve to pursue whatever actions are required, including new ways of thinking and unconventional approaches, to ensure that nuclear energy remains a source of hope and prosperity and not a tool for self-destruction.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me conclude by expressing my continuing gratitude to the Government of Austria, which has now served for over four decades as a most gracious and welcoming host to the IAEA.</div>

	Mr. Nuez Garca-Saco (Spain)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">As the representative of Spain and Chairman of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), I am honoured to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.10.pdf">A/58/L.10</a> on the annual report of the IAEA. The following countries, along with Spain, are sponsors of the text: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia and Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Uganda, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.</div>
	<div class="p">Since the document was first circulated, the following have joined the list of sponsors: Albania, Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Central African Republic, Costa Rica, Guatemala, India, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Republic of Moldova, Slovakia, Thailand, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine, Uruguay and Venezuela. I hope that the new sponsors can be incorporated into the list before we adopt the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to thank the Director General of the IAEA, Mr. ElBaradei, for the statement he has just made, which supplements the information contained in the annual report. All of this highlights the scope and importance of the results achieved by the Agency over the past year.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution before the General Assembly this year incorporates a significant change in format from that of earlier years. The change is due to an attempt to further rationalize our work and that of our colleagues in Vienna, while preserving the essence of the message which the General Assembly's adoption of the draft resolution sends to the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">We are all aware that, since 1990, the year in which the General Assembly adopted the last of the so-called procedural resolutions on the IAEA, the length of such resolutions has undergone rapid and unnecessary growth. The expansion reflected the understandable concern of some Members to highlight in the resolution those aspects of the Agency's work that were of the greatest importance to them. The greater length of the text was inevitably accompanied by a lengthier and more difficult drafting process, frequently including the discussion of issues that had already been negotiated and decided upon at the IAEA General Conference.</div>
	<div class="p">Given those developments, and so as to enhance the efficiency of our efforts, we have decided this year to introduce a draft resolution that strikes a middle ground between the procedural resolutions of the past and the substantive appeal of recent years. By comparison with last year, we shall have a markedly shorter resolution -- perhaps well less than half as long -- which nonetheless retains the essential of the substance.</div>
	<div class="p">In any event, the draft resolution and the annual report together provide sufficient information to give an overall picture of the recent work of the Agency and to give a detailed account of activities in areas of specific interest. So as to focus the attention of the Assembly on the most significant activities of the Agency, the draft resolution does not refer to resolutions and decisions adopted at the most recent IAEA General Conference related to budgetary or procedural issues. This means that, of the 22 resolutions and 5 decisions adopted, only 14 substantive resolutions and 3 substantive decisions are mentioned. By paragraph 2 of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would take note of each of those resolutions and decisions, which, with the exceptions that I shall describe shortly, relate to one of the three pillars of the Agency's activities: nuclear safety, technology transfer and verification of peaceful use.</div>
	<div class="p">Specifically, in the area of nuclear safety, which includes protection from nuclear terrorism, four IAEA resolutions were adopted: a resolution on cooperation in radiological material, transport and waste management (GC(47)/RES/7A); a resolution on the code of conduct on radioactive sources (GC(47)/RES/7B); a resolution on transport safety (GC(47)/RES/7C); and a resolution on progress on measures to protect against nuclear and radiological terrorism (GC(47)/RES/8).</div>
	<div class="p">In the area of technology transfer, six resolutions were adopted: on strengthening of the Agency's technical cooperation activities (GC(47)/RES/9); on strengthening the Agency's activities related to nuclear science, technology and applications (GC(47)/RES/10A); on nuclear knowledge (GC(47)/RES/10B); on the development of innovative nuclear technology (GC(47)/RES/10C); on the use of isotope hydrology for water resources management (GC(47)/RES/10D); and on a plan for producing potable water economically using small and medium-sized nuclear reactors (GC(47)/RES/10E).</div>
	<div class="p">In the area of verification, three resolutions were adopted: on strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and application of the Model Additional Protocol (GC(47)/RES/11); on the implementation of the Agreement between the Agency and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the application of safeguards in connection with the Non-Proliferation Treaty (GC(47)/RES/12); and on the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East (GC(47)/RES/13).</div>
	<div class="p">Additionally, there were two presidential statements: one on the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq (GC(47)/DEC/12); and another on Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat (GC(47)/DEC/13).</div>
	<div class="p">As I indicated earlier, the draft resolution that we are introducing before the General Assembly also mentions two resolutions and a decision that are not substantive in nature, but which refer to topical issues: resolutions GC(47)/RES/14A and B on staffing of the Agency's secretariat and on women in the secretariat, respectively, as well as the General Conference decision amending article VI of the Agency's statute (GC(47)/DEC/14).</div>
	<div class="p">As a final comment, I would like to note that all the resolutions and decisions adopted at the most recent General Conference were a result of the constructive climate of dialogue that prevails in IAEA, and were adopted by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p">It only remains for me to thank Member States for the broad support that this new approach and particularly the text of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.10.pdf">A/58/L.10</a> have received over the course of the informal consultations that I chaired in Vienna, which resulted in broad and solid consensus. The consultations I have been holding over the past week in New York have also revealed widespread support for the initiative. At the time, I asked States present in the consultations not to reopen issues already negotiated and agreed upon in Vienna. At this stage, I would like to repeat that appeal to all States, and to express my confidence that draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.10.pdf">A/58/L.10</a> will be adopted by a broad majority and, if possible, by consensus.</div>

	Mr. Trezza (Italy)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The acceding countries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, the associated countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey and the European Free Trade Association countries that are members of the European Economic Area Iceland and Norway align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p">First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his statement on the Agency's 2002 report and for providing the General Assembly with additional information on the main developments in IAEA activities during 2003. The European Union commends the secretariat of the IAEA and its Director General for the excellent work done by the Agency and for the importance of the results achieved last year.</div>
	<div class="p">The States members of the European Union, which were among the most active participants in the forty-seventh IAEA General Conference, held in Vienna from 15 to 19 September 2003, welcome the outcome of the Conference and the 15 resolutions and 5 decisions that were adopted there.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union member States and acceding countries are all sponsoring the draft resolution on the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (<a href="../pdf/A-58-L.10.pdf">A/58/L.10</a>) and fully support its content. They also wish to thank the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, Ambassador Nez Garca-Saco, for his presentation. The draft resolution reflects broad agreement among IAEA member States and is the result of intense consultations in Vienna. We commend the Chairman of the IAEA Board of Governors for his efforts and hope that the present draft resolution will be adopted by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p">At the European Council held in Thessaloniki in June this year, the heads of State or Government of the EU reiterated their commitment to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and to the objective of deterring, halting and, where possible, reversing the expansion of proliferation programmes worldwide. The European Union believes that a nuclear non-proliferation regime of universal character, supported by a strong system of international safeguards, is an essential prerequisite for collective security. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of this global non-proliferation regime, and the IAEA safeguards system is its essential international instrument. The Union is fully committed to the NPT and will continue its efforts to maintain the authority and integrity of the Treaty.</div>
	<div class="p">The universal adoption and implementation of safeguards agreements and additional protocols to them is definitely the key to an effective and credible safeguards system. The EU considers that the IAEA comprehensive safeguards, including the additional protocols, constitute the verification standard. The measures contained in the additional protocols are especially crucial to strengthening the IAEA's ability to detect possible undeclared nuclear material and activities and to provide assurances about the absence of such activities.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union wishes to recall its concern regarding the continued existence of unsafeguarded nuclear facilities and material in States not parties to the NPT. The EU calls upon those States to accede to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States and to place all their nuclear activities under IAEA safeguards.</div>
	<div class="p">The fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction represents a challenge of paramount importance for the international community. The European Union member States strongly support all measures aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons. While the primary responsibility for the necessary nuclear security rests with member States, the Agency clearly has an essential role to play in combating nuclear terror. After 11 September 2001, the IAEA moved rapidly to reorient and reinforce its activities relevant to protections against nuclear terrorism. We support the work of the IAEA in this field and we welcome contributions provided by member countries to the Nuclear Security Fund.</div>
	<div class="p">The IAEA General Conference approved its programme and budget for 2004-2005. The European Union is well aware of the difficult context in which the Agency has to finance its statutory obligations under its regular budget. It was in fact mainly due to the unavoidable and exceptional future needs of the IAEA's verification activities that the EU member countries were able to accept the compromise package that led to the substantial increase in the budget for 2004-2005.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union fully supports the IAEA Director General in his continued efforts to improve the effectiveness of the Agency. A results-based approach to budgeting requires strong management and a clear definition of cross-cutting activities. Enhanced cooperation and coordination between departments should be encouraged, leading to greater synergy and the better use of resources -- human as well as financial.</div>
	<div class="p">Nuclear safety is an ongoing concern of the international community, and its continuous improvement is the goal of all IAEA member States. The responsibilities of the States engaged in nuclear activity with respect to their own population, their neighbours and the international community cannot be overemphasized. The European Union member States and acceding countries closely cooperate to maintain a high level of nuclear safety in the Union, including during the decommissioning of nuclear installations and the management of radioactive wastes.</div>
	<div class="p">Technical cooperation, together with international safeguards and nuclear safety, are the three pillars of the Agency's activities. The European Union has always played an instrumental role in the IAEA's technical cooperation and development. The level of voluntary contributions provided by EU member States to the Technical Cooperation Fund in 2003 will, in fact, amount to well over 35 per cent of total contributions.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union supported the decision reached at the General Conference on technical cooperation funding for the near future. On this matter, the Union wishes to underline that the funds must be used in the most cost-effective, efficient and transparent way.</div>
	<div class="p">The IAEA's indispensable role as the competent authority for the verification of compliance with the safeguards agreements covering the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons has proved to be worthy of the international community's trust. The Agency also plays an essential role in promoting the safe usage of nuclear technology for peaceful applications in those member States which use that technology. Finally, the IAEA, through its technical cooperation programmes, contributes to the achievement of tangible social and economic benefits and to the scientific advancement of member States.</div>
	<div class="p">The most recent European Council meeting reiterated its grave concern about Iran's nuclear programme and gave its full support to the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution of 12 September. The European Union expects Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA in its implementation and welcomes the result of the talks held in Tehran on 21 October, according to which Iran will sign and continue to apply the Additional Protocol, allowing unrestricted access to inspectors and voluntarily suspend all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities. The EU believes that the full implementation of Iran's decisions will open the way to dialogue on the basis of longer-term cooperation, which will provide all parties with satisfactory assurances relating to Iran's nuclear-power-generation programme. The full resolution of international concerns would create conditions for developing cooperation with Iran in a range of areas.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union is alarmed about the fact that it has still not been possible for the IAEA to verify the degree of completeness and correctness of the initial report by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of its nuclear materials. The European Union commends the Agency for its efforts since last September, and supports efforts by the Director General to seek dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in order to find a solution for the implementation of safeguards. Furthermore, since December 2002 the IAEA has been unable to confirm the non-diversion of nuclear material to non-peaceful uses. The EU notes that the IAEA Board of Governors has reported to the Security Council on further non-compliance by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with its safeguards agreement.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union supports the continuation of the dialogue among all interested parties. For that reason it welcomes the two meetings held in Beijing with a view to finding a possible negotiated solution to the question, and encourages all the parties involved in those meetings to pursue negotiations actively and in good faith. We strongly urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to come unconditionally into full compliance with all of its relevant international commitments, in particular its IAEA safeguards agreement under the NPT.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union commends the work done by the IAEA in Iraq since last year's General Conference. The EU supports all efforts made by the IAEA to continue to verify the nuclear material in Iraq, and welcomes the IAEA's mission, which focused on verification of the material subject to safeguards in Tuwaitha, where looting had reportedly taken place. Although the Agency's mandate in Iraq under various Security Council resolutions still stands, the Council stated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a> that it will revisit that mandate. The EU looks forward to such a review. Nonetheless, the Union wishes to recall that, irrespective of the mandate under Security Council resolutions, the Agency has the continuing obligation, under Iraq's NPT safeguards agreement, to ensure the non-diversion of nuclear material declared and placed under its safeguards in Iraq.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union and the acceding countries reiterate their full support for the Agency and their commitment to the full realization of its statutory functions and renew the appeal for the prompt and unanimous adoption of the draft resolution under consideration.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. De Rivero" nation="Peru" language="Spanish">
	Mr. De Rivero (Peru)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) tells us that the greatest challenges currently facing the Agency relate to strengthening safeguards and ensuring the effectiveness of the non-proliferation regime. We are therefore concerned about the fact that the report also states that progress in establishing a safeguards system is continuing to be discouragingly slow, in particular as concerns the number of States with additional protocols in force. The situation is compounded by the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula, which can jeopardize international stability. We hope that the diplomatic consultations under way can turn that dangerous situation around. In light of the lack of progress on the safeguards issue, we appeal once again to all States to sign and implement comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols and to comply strictly and transparently with the recommendations that the Agency makes in that regard.</div>
	<div class="p">With respect to the challenge of non-proliferation, today we wish to announce that, with Cuba's ratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), as well as its decision to conclude a safeguards agreement and an additional protocol, Latin America has consolidated its status as the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in the world. However, the exemplary situation in Latin America is the exception to the rule today in terms of non-proliferation.</div>
	<div class="p">Since the 1960s, my country has participated actively in creating and strengthening the NPT. Indeed, I myself was President of one of the NPT Review Conferences. However, today, in the light of that experience, we believe that the existing non-proliferation regime is being overwhelmed by the challenges of the twenty-first century. We must acknowledge today that it is increasingly clear that the nuclear-non-proliferation regime of the past century is failing. The temporary asymmetry accepted in the 1960s between NPT nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon States has been perpetuated because nuclear disarmament has not been carried out in keeping with the requirements of the NPT. Moreover, there has been a proliferation of more nuclear States; today we can count perhaps nine such States.</div>
	<div class="p">Controlling access to nuclear-weapons technology has become increasingly difficult. Almost all nuclear technological development today is of dual use. It may be peaceful and military at the same time. Today one can easily find available literature with formulas for the manufacture of explosive nuclear devices. Today we also have nuclear scientists who are unemployed or poorly employed, who can offer their services not only to States that aspire to become nuclear States, but also to terrorist groups.</div>
	<div class="p">Given these new challenges, we believe that the time has come to envisage a new international non-proliferation regime which would limit the processing of weapon-usable nuclear material in civilian nuclear programmes, control the production of new nuclear material by enrichment, administer the disposal of fuel and radioactive waste and, finally, ban the production of fissile material for military use with a view to beginning the reduction of nuclear weapons.</div>
	<div class="p">We need to be realistic and reduce nuclear-weapon stocks, because these weapons fulfil no strategic function in the face of the challenges of the twenty-first century. What can nuclear weapons do to counter terrorism, except encourage their own proliferation? What can nuclear weapons do about civil wars of national disintegration that are ravaging the world? What can they do about financial crises or trafficking in drugs, persons and small arms? What can they do against global pollution, poverty and major human migrations?</div>
	<div class="p">I have the impression that the globalization of human contacts in the twenty-first century will change our perception about the relevance of nuclear weapons.
