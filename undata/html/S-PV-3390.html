	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">My delegation considers the operations of the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) indispensable to achieving the objectives set forth by the Security Council. Ever since its creation, UNFICYP has played a vital role in maintaining peace on the island and ensuring a climate conducive to political negotiations between the leadership of two Cypriot communities. We therefore welcome the fact that the mandate of UNFICYP has been extended for a further period ending on 31 December 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">However, my delegation would have preferred a brief procedural resolution extending the mandate of UNFICYP without going into the substance of political issues at this stage. The political aspects of the problem would be best addressed at the time when the Security Council carries out an in-depth consideration of the Secretary-General's report of 30 May 1994 on his Mission of Good Offices in Cyprus, and a further report on the subject which is still awaited.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">My delegation remains optimistic about the prospects for positive results on the package of confidence-building measures and the Mission of Good Offices by the Secretary General in Cyprus. We are gratified to note that on 20 January 1994 the Turkish Cypriot leadership accepted, in principle, the package of confidence-building measures suggested by the Secretary-General in his report of 1 July 1993. Furthermore, we are encouraged to note that on 31 May 1994 the Turkish Cypriot leader conveyed to the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Cyprus acceptance of the agreements reached in Vienna on 11-12 May 1994, provided those ideas were incorporated in the text of the confidence-building measures agreement to be concluded between the two sides. We consider these steps as a manifestation of the political will on the part of the Turkish Cypriot leadership to make progress on the question of confidence-building measures relating to the fenced area of Varosha and Nicosia international airport, as well as an overall political settlement of the problem.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">We express the hope that acceptance and implementation of the package of confidence-building measures, with the agreement of both sides, offers the best possibility at this stage of making progress towards securing a lasting solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>
