	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">This morning the General Assembly will proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1996.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">The five non-permanent outgoing members are the following: Botswana, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia and Italy. These five States cannot be re-elected and therefore their names should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in 1997 the following States: Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the Republic of Korea. The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">Of the five non-permanent members which will remain in office in 1997 three are from Africa and Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: two from Africa and Asia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean and two from Western European and other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to be elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa and one from Asia.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa07">I should like to inform the Assembly that the number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa08">In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa09">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballots, and there shall be no nominations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">Regarding candidatures, I have been informed that for the two vacancies from among the African and Asian States, there are three candidates, namely India, Japan and Kenya. Kenya has been endorsed by the group of African States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">As for the Latin American and Caribbean States, there are two candidates for one vacancy. The two candidates are Bolivia and Costa Rica.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">From among the Western European and other States, there are three candidates for two vacancies: Australia, Portugal and Sweden.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa05">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to the election by secret ballot.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa07">I request representatives to use only those ballot papers that have been distributed and to write on them the names of the five States for which they wish to vote.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa08">A ballot paper containing more names from the relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. Names on a ballot paper of Member States which do not belong to that region will not be counted.</p>

The delegation of Bolivia wishes to express thanks for the support it received from the delegations that voted for us.

We shall therefore proceed to the first restricted ballot. This second round of balloting shall be restricted to the two States from among the Latin American and Caribbean States that were not elected but that obtained the largest number of votes in the previous ballot -- Bolivia and Costa Rica, bearing in mind the statement we just heard from the representative of Bolivia -- and to the two States from among the Western European and other States that were not elected but obtained the largest number of votes on the previous ballot -- Australia and Portugal.
