<div class="spoken" id="1-5">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Clodumar" nation="Nauru" language="">
	Mr. Clodumar (Nauru)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum group of countries that are members of the United Nations and that maintain Permanent Missions in New York: Australia, Fiji, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country, Nauru.</div>
	<div class="p">The members of the Pacific Islands Forum group join the rest of the world in expressing shock and outrage at the tragic events of 11 September in this our host city of New York, in Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania. We wish to convey the sorrow and the thoughts of our peoples to the Government and the people of the United States, through the Permanent Representative of the United States of America. We also wish to express our admiration for the way in which the people of this city in particular have responded, and for the spirit that the people of the United States of America are demonstrating at this difficult time.</div>
	<div class="p">It is now clear that no part of the world is immune to terrorist activities. Terrorist organizations are active in many parts of the world, and unfortunately it would be unrealistic to assume that the Pacific will continue to be free of this scourge. Even if terrorists are not active in our territory, these acts of terrorism have consequences for us all. Nationals from a number of our member countries were victims of the attacks. Nationals from our countries reside in the United States and in other countries where terrorist attacks have occurred, and may occur again.</div>
	<div class="p">There are also other, perhaps less immediate, effects. For instance, the inevitable impact of these events on global air transportation may have significant consequences for the Pacific, a region in which safe and regular air transport is critical. In this interconnected world, we are all affected.</div>
	<div class="p">The leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, in their joint declaration issued on 26 September, recognized the 11 September attacks as not only against the United States of America, but against humanity and common decency. The leaders recalled their 1998 decision collectively condemning international terrorism and reaffirming their support for international cooperation aimed at its eradication, and expressed their commitment to do everything in their power to assist in bringing those responsible for the heinous act and all other acts of international terrorism to justice.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, Mr. Noel Levi, in his statement of 12 September, said,</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"This is an attack on ... the community of nations."</div>
	<div class="p">As such, it requires a strong response from the community of nations.</div>
	<div class="p">The attacks undermine the very basis of this Organization, and this Organization must rise above itself to meet the challenge. All countries must join in efforts to combat terrorism, and the Pacific Islands Forum group is committed to doing what needs to be done. Although most of us do not have the economic or military capability to contribute to the fight against terrorism, we can and will provide the moral and political support pledged by our leaders.</div>
	<div class="p">The Group welcomes Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, adopted on 28 September, calling on Member States, among other things, to cooperate, particularly through bilateral and multilateral arrangements and agreements to prevent and suppress terrorist attacks and take action against perpetrators of such acts. The Security Council acted under Chapter VII of the Charter, thereby obligating Member States to heed the action it has prescribed to meet the objectives against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, members of the Group will take the necessary actions to suppress the financing of terrorism, including the freezing of funds and other assets of individuals, groups and States involved in or supporting terrorism; assist in criminal investigations and information exchange about such individuals or groups; and restrict the international movement of such individuals or groups within international norms and the rule of law.</div>
	<div class="p">We acknowledge that these actions will require changes to legislation in some cases. Effective implementation will also require enhanced regional cooperation and greater flows of information from outside the region.</div>
	<div class="p">Existing Pacific regional initiatives will also assist in the fight against terrorism. Regional efforts to assist States to strengthen the regulation of money flows will be relevant to efforts to combat the financing of terrorism. Regional efforts and programmes to control flows of small arms into and within the region will also help improve regional security and counter terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">To these ends, there is an urgent need to recognize the importance of supporting existing regional initiatives. In our own region, for example, there is a real need for assistance to facilitate the carrying out of regional security measures initiated by the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, particularly in the areas of security personnel training, legislation to combat financing for terrorism and the dissemination of relevant information on terrorist groups and their activities.</div>
	<div class="p">We therefore welcome the offers made by some States during this debate to assist other States to participate fully in international efforts to combat terrorism, and look forward to such support for the strengthening of regional initiatives.</div>
	<div class="p">Members of the Pacific Island Forum group are also looking at ways to increase their participation in the existing framework of international instruments combating terrorism. The group will also join other States in working towards the adoption of a comprehensive convention against terrorism that builds upon and strengthens that framework later in this General Assembly session.</div>
	<div class="p">In closing, the members of the Pacific Island Forum group are committed to joining with other countries in taking all possible measures to eliminate terrorism. There has been a challenge to this Organization and to the international community, but we believe that through a strong and united response, this Organization and the international community will emerge stronger.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Jokonya" nation="Zimbabwe" language="">
	Mr. Jokonya (Zimbabwe)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me to associate my delegation with those who have spoken before us in expressing our deep sense of shock and horror at the ghastly attacks against the Government of the United States, its people and all the peace-loving people of the world, by quoting from President Mugabe's condolence message to President George Bush:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"My Government, the people of Zimbabwe, and I personally share the shock, anger and anguish of your Government, the citizens of the United States (at home and abroad), the families of the injured and the deceased and your own anguish and heavy sense of responsibility. Mr. President, as you contemplate what needs to be done, we are with you."</div>
	<div class="p">Let me underscore that perhaps the most frightening aspect of the 11 September terrorist acts is that terrorists can strike at any time and anywhere. Among the victims of the World Trade Center attacks were Zimbabwean citizens who were peacefully pursuing their American dream.</div>
	<div class="p">As the world mourns with friends and relatives, I urge this body to accept that this is not a tragedy for America alone but one for the whole international community. The 11 September attacks show that terrorism leads to the death and injury of innocent civilians and bystanders totally uninvolved in terrorist causes. Terrorism has afflicted the world for long enough, and it is our considered view that our deliberations today should be action-oriented. How do we fight terrorism?</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorist acts are criminal, whatever the motives of the terrorist or the cause served. Terrorism is defined by actions, not by the cause it is intended to serve, if there is any cause at all. Killing innocent civilians and hijacking planes are all terrorist acts, even though those responsible may claim that they work towards some kind of objective. This is the clear intention of the unanimous General Assembly <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-40-61">resolution 40/61</a> of 1985, which condemns as criminal "all acts, methods and practices of terrorism wherever and by whomever committed".</div>
	<div class="p">The condemnation of international terrorism as criminal must be understood as imposing obligations on all States to take appropriate measures to prevent acts of international terrorism. This includes the duty to refrain from aiding, supporting or acquiescing in terrorist activities. For a State to allow a terrorist base within its territory would be incompatible with these obligations. The failure to apprehend persons who have carried out terrorist acts in other countries or aided and abetted such acts is likewise a violation of international obligations.</div>
	<div class="p">Whatever programme of action emerges from today's deliberations, it must be underscored that the relationship between international politics and foreign affairs, on one hand, and international law, on the other, is often somewhat ambiguous with respect to the problem of terrorism. There is no commonly accepted legal definition of terrorism, just as there is no commonly accepted political definition. However, as Professor Robert Friedlander has said:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Even though there is no acceptable legal definition, there need not be if one deals with terrorism as a criminal act. Whatever the means and however employed, acts of terror-violence are common crimes in every civilized society on this earth. Therefore, an exact legal definition is not necessary, if one merely deals with the elements of the actus reus in question: murder, serious bodily harm, reckless endangerment, intentional infliction or severe mental distress."</div>
	<div class="p">The judgement by Friedlander reflects the usual impatience of the legal mind with what is essentially a political and diplomatic process. In this regard, we should seek guidance from the United Nations, which has long been a forum for efforts to deal with terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">It is a given that whether terrorism is domestic or international in character, affected Governments must, of course, act. All Government action to deal with terrorism falls into four categories; prevention; protection; crisis or incident management; and punishment. These four tasks must be implemented in the international as well as the domestic arena.</div>
	<div class="p">There is a fundamental difference, however, between accomplishing these tasks domestically and accomplishing them internationally. At home, every Government is the sovereign authority and has at its disposal of the police and political authority of the State. Internationally, each Government has distinctly limited authority and must approach the problem in cooperation with fellow Governments.</div>
	<div class="p">In dealing with terrorism, each Government decides how much it wishes to work with other Governments. Such cooperation can take many forms. For instance, it could take the form of information exchange between police and intelligence services, joint planning to deal with terrorist attacks, actual cooperation in an incident, or cooperation in the pursuit of terrorists.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation takes note of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which the Security Council adopted on 28 September 2001, and will support efforts at suppressing the financing of terrorism. Zimbabwe is ready to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism, and looks forward to positively considering all requests coming within the context of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, my delegation wishes to reiterate that international terrorism is an offence against the peace and security of mankind. In 1970 the General Assembly emphasized that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State" (<i>resolution 2625 (XXV), annex, para. 1</i>)</div>
	<div class="p">and that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Also, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the régime of another State." (ibid.)</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Belinga-Eboutou" nation="Cameroon" language="French">
	Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">First of all, I would like to convey to you, Mr. President, our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I assure you of the full cooperation of my delegation for the successful accomplishment of your difficult task.</div>
	<div class="p">At its twenty-seventh session, in 1972, 29 years ago, the General Assembly decided to include on its agenda an item on measures to eliminate terrorism. Since then, this item has been considered annually in the Assembly's legal Committee. Unfortunately, we have seen acts of terrorism continue, killing innocent people and targeting the very structures of society. The foundations of democracy have been shaken. What is the status of human rights in all of this? They have been annihilated.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly's decision to consider the issue of terrorism in plenary meeting stems from a heightened awareness of the seriousness and magnitude of this evil. Since that black Tuesday, 11 September 2001, the crime of terrorism is no longer simply a phenomenon of wanton violence. Unfortunately, the world now faces a widespread danger, and a very serious threat. Terrorism has taken hold of the collective imagination and is sowing fear. Never before has an act of criminal madness so shaken the universal human conscience as the attacks perpetrated on that day on American soil.</div>
	<div class="p">Those still alive who planned or were complicit in that bloody and destructive act of terror inflicted on thousands of innocent people must answer for their acts. Of course, it was the territory of the United States that was targeted; but the scope of their action is without doubt global in nature. Each and every one of us must pause to remember the victims in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. I wish to recall here the message sent to President Bush on this sad occasion by the President of the Republic of Cameroon, Mr. Paul Biya:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Mr. President, Cameroon has been following with dismay the dreadful tragedy your country is experiencing on this day. On the occasion of this difficult ordeal for yourself, for the United States and for the American people, I would like to convey to you, on behalf of the people and the Government of Cameroon, and on my own behalf, our most heartfelt sympathy. To the bereaved families that were so cruelly stricken, I extend my saddest condolences and the deep compassion of the entire people of Cameroon."</div>
	<div class="p">The entire world shares the deep sorrow of the American people and of the bereaved families, who, like Rachel in the Bible, will forever mourn their children who once were and are no more. The entire world shares this shock. We must all act together so that the planners of and accomplices to the attacks do not go unpunished. Of course, we must give due place to reason and reflection and to the rule of law and the rights that guarantee and protect the great basic values defended by the United Nations and by democracies. Reason dictates avoiding any action that, by its consequences and scope, may be akin to a collective reprisal affecting innocent peoples and communities.</div>
	<div class="p">After this tragedy no State or authority can deny that terrorism is a threat to international peace and security. It is for that reason that mobilizing to prevent and fight terrorism involves the entire international community. In that regard, I would like to welcome the adoption of various conventions on terrorism by the General Assembly and regional organizations. The latest of those deals with suppressing the financing of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The recent events should induce States to sign and ratify those instruments, along with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Even though they are sectoral, those conventions, once they enter into force, will mark tangible progress in our quest for effective legal weaponry in our cooperative struggle against terrorism. To supplement those instruments, a comprehensive convention against international terrorism is needed.</div>
	<div class="p">The tragedy that struck the peoples of the United Nations on 11 September gives us the duty to rise above differences relating to definitions and succeed, at this session, in the negotiations on a draft convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism and on a comprehensive convention against this scourge. Here, Cameroon repeats the proposal of the Non-Aligned Movement to convene a high-level conference, under United Nations auspices, to define a common international community response to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. That proposal is more necessary than ever.</div>
	<div class="p">Because of its membership and its powers, the United Nations is the ideal framework to pull together the various elements of an effective collective international community response to terrorism. Cameroon endorses and supports in every respect Security Council resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">1368 (2001)</a> of 12 September and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September. In that connection, we are committed to continued and intensified exchanges of information on the movements of suspicious individuals. Cameroon is already a party to a number of anti-terrorism conventions, and it will pursue its policy of signing various relevant instruments. Cameroon is, further, committed to cooperating with the Security Council in the context of the machinery to follow up the implementation of Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">In November 2002, Cameroon will host the seventy-first General Assembly of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL). We shall ensure that special attention is devoted to strengthening overall cooperation and police and law enforcement cooperation to fight terrorism and organized crime.</div>
	<div class="p">Cameroon believes that, if we are to succeed in our implacable combat against terrorism, we must strengthen national structures and national capacity. Because of terrorism's complex modus operandi, we need greater assistance from developed countries and from the international community, especially in the areas of technology, training and information; investigative teams must be trained to combat this worldwide scourge. Only such assistance, which is sorely needed, will enable developing countries to carry out viable anti-terrorist policies. The fight also requires a genuine and unequivocal commitment from all States to refrain from complacency or active or passive complicity with respect to terrorists or those who would be terrorists. No State should for any reason harbour terrorists; no State or community should offer facilities, or training camps or facilities to those who intend to assault the integrity of States or individuals.</div>
	<div class="p">To succeed in our fight against terrorism, each and every one of us must understand the need to promote a culture of tolerance and democracy. To succeed in our fight against terrorism, we must avoid sowing seeds of division or weakness within our ranks. That is why we must disavow and denounce the pseudo-intellectuals who seek to use the sad events of 11 September to prove the highly dubious theory of the clash of civilizations. Such ideas are more an apologia for hatred than intellectually credible and valid reasoning.</div>
	<div class="p">No one people has a monopoly on terrorism; terrorism is worldwide. In all cultures, there have always been terrorists or anarchists who are prepared -- even impatient and eager -- to engage in killing and self-immolation. Therefore, combating terrorism also means rejecting the notion that terrorism is specific to any particular religious community or in any one people. Combating terrorism means rejecting duality between civilizations. The only valid rule is respect for the values and beliefs of each and every people. Human dignity and human belief cannot be measured or defined in terms of wealth or poverty, but only in terms of a universal moral imperative.</div>
	<div class="p">By causing the death of some 6,000 men and women, those responsible for the 11 September 2001 attacks rejected the sanctity of life. By violating respect for life, they violated not only one of the universal principles of human rights but also, and above all, one of the major divine messages of Islam, a religion that advocates love and peace.</div>
	<div class="p">During the Millennium Summit, we committed ourselves to freeing people from all fear. So why should we not declare the month of September, every year, a month to combat terrorism in all its forms? That would express and maintain our common determination to ensure that we never again witness what we experienced on 11 September 2001.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Lelong" nation="Haiti" language="French">
	Mr. Lelong (Haiti)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The Haitian delegation wishes to associate itself with preceding speakers to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We wish you every success this year -- a year that promises to be a turbulent one -- and we assure you of our full cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p">The Haitian delegation wishes also to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the talent and skill he displayed during his tenure. The Haitian delegation would also convey to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, its sincere best wishes and its appreciation for the outstanding work he has done to preserve peace and promote development. He has shown intelligence and wisdom at a time when the world is confronting many challenges.</div>
	<div class="p">The Haitian delegation certainly cannot fail to reiterate, on behalf of the Haitian Government, its sincerest condolences to the Government and the people of the United States, as well as to the bereaved families and friends of the victims. I should like to assure them that we share their grief at many levels, since the barbaric attacks of the morning of 11 September against this country claimed the lives of nationals of many countries, including Haiti.</div>
	<div class="p">The Haitian delegation associates itself with the statement made by the representative of Dominica on behalf of the 14 members of the Caribbean Community. We do, however, wish to make a few comments on the item under consideration.</div>
	<div class="p">Because of the tragedy of 11 September, the Assembly is meeting to reflect together on how to coordinate an effective and collective response to international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as terrorism poses a genuine threat and a challenge to all of humankind.</div>
	<div class="p">All of us witnessed the tragedy, which is already being seen as a turning point in our history -- a time when our hearts, wounded by the psychological impact of this heinous act, prompt us to rally together in order collectively to confront this scourge. I wish to reaffirm that my country condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever it is perpetrated and by whomever, and regardless of the identity of its victims or of its masterminds. These inhuman acts undermine the very basis of the democratic system by jeopardizing international peace and security, freedom, human rights and the search for well-being and prosperity.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, the Haitian delegation is pleased at the speed and the unequivocal way in which the General Assembly and the Security Council expressed their outrage and their profound condemnation.</div>
	<div class="p">The Haitian delegation deems it important to support the people of the United States in its quest for justice through a measured and timely response, thereby emphasizing to the identified perpetrators and accomplices that such acts have consequences. We believe it important that justice be done and that we not yield to the easy temptation of Babylonian vengeance, which could give rise to an uncontrollable spiral of violence. While there is an enormous -- and understandable -- temptation to respond brutally to barbarity, this would also pose the danger of making us, in a way, the allies of terrorists, since our responses could further fuel their fundamentalism.</div>
	<div class="p">Let us recall together what Benjamin Franklin told his compatriots more than two centuries ago:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." <i>(Historical Review of Pennsylvania, 1759)</i></div>
	<div class="p">Hatred must not be on the agenda, nor can fear be a convenient justification. Let it be clear: we are not witnessing a clash between civilizations, but, rather, a battle for civilization and for our shared humanity.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community already has 10 conventions, complemented by two protocols, that deal with terrorism in all its aspects, and two additional initiatives are being considered. These international legal instruments should be strengthened. It is in the interest of all States to comply with international legality, not to oppose it in the name of a kind of sovereignty that is often denied the weakest. Along these lines, an effort must be made to arrive at the ratification and the effective implementation of the principal international legal instruments.</div>
	<div class="p">Likewise, for some time now we have been witnessing the rise of armed groups, which may be small numerically but are terrifying in view of their destructive capacity. They are a monstrous expression of an uncivil society and steadily are forming an international network. We must denounce these disturbed fundamentalists who are in our midst and strip them of the protection afforded them by alleged sovereignty.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, the Haitian delegation does not wish to downplay the importance of international legal instruments, which certainly are essential in combating terrorism and in avoiding any recurrence of such tragedies. The present objective -- the major objective -- of the international community remains the effective struggle against terrorism. Nonetheless, it is also of great importance that we reflect together on the social, political, economic and other factors that engender terrorism. In this battle without quarter -- a battle in which there can be no concessions to this evil -- the international community must also identify its roots and address them. The statistics of injustice abound. We know them all, but we tend to respond with indifference. The international community must, under the auspices of the United Nations and in a spirit of tolerance and solidarity, form a major coalition against poverty, ignorance, misery, hunger, social exclusion, marginalization -- a task that is now more urgent than ever.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Mmualefe" nation="Botswana" language="">
	Mr. Mmualefe (Botswana)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On behalf of the delegation of Botswana, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved unanimous election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We have full confidence that you will be able to guide the work of this rather extraordinary session to a successful conclusion.</div>
	<div class="p">Through you, Mr. President, we would like also to convey our unqualified appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for the exemplary and diligent manner in which he presided over the work of the fifty-fifth session.</div>
	<div class="p">The heinous acts of terrorism of 11 September, which resulted in a massive loss of civilian life and in the total transformation of the landscape of our great host city, New York, and the similar attacks on Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, were a tremendous shock to all of us.</div>
	<div class="p">President Festus Mogae of Botswana joined the leaders of all other peace-loving nations in condemning in the strongest terms the barbaric and cowardly acts of terrorism visited upon the people of the United States of America and conveyed, on behalf of the Government and people of Botswana, our heartfelt condolences to the victims and their families, to President Bush and to the Government and people of the United States.</div>
	<div class="p">This body has long appreciated the enormous threat of terrorism and the fight against terrorism has long been at the forefront of our efforts to make our global village more habitable. Our collective history bears with it a regrettable trail of tragic and vile acts of terrorism, many of them aimed at undermining the tranquillity and peace that our community of nations has been tirelessly working to attain. No single attack can stand above any other with regard to national impact, each nation logically mourning the loss of friends and countrymen and experiencing a heightened sense of insecurity. What separates this act from others, however, is its visibility, its unprecedented magnitude of lives lost, its meticulous conception and execution and its confounding simplicity, penetrating arguably the most secure defensive and intelligence capability the world has ever known. We have all been given a jolting wake-up call. We are all on heightened security alert.</div>
	<div class="p">Therefore, the decision taken by the General Assembly to discuss in the plenary the broader aspects of the persistent and abominable scourge of terrorism could not have been more timely, and it is a good gesture of our collective resolve to adequately address all aspects of this problem. We therefore welcome the opportunity to be able to take part in the discussions on this important question.</div>
	<div class="p">Through its Legal Committee and Third Committee, the General Assembly has adopted a series of annual resolutions addressing legal and human rights aspects of the question of terrorism. The Security Council has also long been actively seized with this issue, insofar as it constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. Together with such entities as the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the International Maritime Organization, amongst others, the international community has over time formulated a global cross-sectoral response to the scourge of terrorism by developing an array of antiterrorism legal instruments and by laying down provisions addressing a number of terrorist activities, ranging from the seizure of aircraft to hostage-taking and the financing of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, every corner of the globe has also seen a proliferation of regional anti-terrorism conventions. In my own region, at a summit of the African leaders meeting in Algiers, Algeria, on 14 July 1999, the Organization of African Unity adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, underlining, amongst other things, Africa's awareness of the necessity</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"to promote human and moral values based on tolerance and rejection of all forms of terrorism irrespective of their motivation"</div>
	<div class="p">and obligating</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"States Parties to undertake to refrain from any acts aimed at organizing, supporting, financing, committing or inciting to commit terrorist acts, or providing havens for terrorists, directly or indirectly, including the provision of weapons and their stockpiling in their countries and the issuing of visas and travel documents."</div>
	<div class="p">Similar efforts have been made in other regions as well to conclude regional agreements and mutually agreed declarations.</div>
	<div class="p">At the national level, many of us have, to varying degrees, responded positively and made significant efforts to participate in the global response against terrorism. The realization that in this global village, all nations -- big or small and regardless of any long-established tradition of internal political stability and democratic values based on tolerance for each other -- are equally vulnerable to the scourge of terrorism has prompted us to take immediate action. Botswana is a party to a number of regional and international anti-terrorism instruments. Following the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan, Botswana became the fourth State party to the recent International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, adopted by this General Assembly only 22 months ago on 9 December 1999. As called for by this Assembly in paragraph 6 of its <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a> of 17 December 1996, we can only encourage all other nations not yet parties to this invaluable wealth of legal instruments to consider doing so as expeditiously as possible.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Botswana takes seriously its obligations towards the provisions of all these legal instruments and our level of participation in many of these instruments is testimony to our resolve to do all that is within our means to help international efforts to stamp out terrorism in all its aspects. Our message is very loud and clear. We will criminalize and punish any form of terror unjustifiably unleashed on any target within our borders on whatever motivation -- political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious, intolerance, extremist or other unacceptable pretext. Our judicial system will put into place measures designed to arrest, extradite or prosecute those suspected of committing acts of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">We will redouble our efforts and take resolute measures not to allow our territory to act as a safe haven for any terrorist activity and we are committed to exchanging such relevant information as required to assist collective efforts against the phenomenon of terrorism. We will also do all that is within our means to stifle funding for any terrorist activities.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me to state the obvious. The triumphant battle against terrorism is far from over. These latest tragic events highlighted the magnitude and diverse forms of contemporary terrorism. There is as yet no known early warning system to effectively counter the phenomenon of terrorism. In this highly globalized world, we are all equally vulnerable.</div>
	<div class="p">As stated earlier, the international community has responded quite positively to this challenge, adopting a series of resolutions and decisions and enacting at least a dozen conventions and protocols on the matter. But the emerging threat of terrorism has shown us that a successful battle against this menace cannot be won on paper alone. We must, all of us, summon the necessary political will and muster the courage if we are to succeed in our efforts. Above all, the collective good of our community of nations must prevail over this phenomenon, regardless of our prevalent lack of terminology consensus and definition problems of what constitutes "terrorism". We should accept that the problem is real and affects us all. We cannot allow any form of differences to derail our meaningful collective efforts to address the problem.</div>
	<div class="p">As clearly outlined in the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, annexed to <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-49-60">resolution 49/60</a>, adopted by the General Assembly in December 1994, our determination to eliminate international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations requires us to make a conscious effort to honour our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, and to promote and implement, in all honesty and good faith, the letter and spirit of all the existing treaties relating to various aspects of the problem of international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">We must all cooperate in bringing to justice all those responsible for acts of terrorism. As recognized by this Assembly, our greatest strength and chance of success also lies in our desire to cooperate and to coordinate our activities in combating other crimes closely associated with terrorism. Many terrorist individuals and groups are known to profit and prosper through drug-trafficking, the unlawful arms trade and money-laundering, among other illegal activities. I can only echo the sentiments of the Executive Director of the Vienna-based United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP) that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Success in combating terrorism requires both strategic insights from research and international cooperation based on `best practices' and `lessons learned'."</div>
	<div class="p">To this end, the establishment by the General Assembly of the Vienna-based Terrorism Prevention Branch within the ODCCP, and of the United Nations Centre for International Crime Prevention, was a step in the right direction. These entities still require further strengthening.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, we must not allow clandestine terrorist activities to exploit our hard won-technological innovations in order to terrorize and threaten our very existence.</div>
	<div class="p">For many of our nations, particularly developing countries, the emerging threat of international terrorism presents an additional challenge to the already precarious situation resulting from enormous problems on the social, political and economic fronts. The challenges presented by poverty, underdevelopment, conflict and political instability, and the scourge of life-threatening diseases like HIV/AIDS, place us in dire need of resources and technical assistance to help us upgrade our capacities to effectively participate in the global coalition against terrorism. There is no doubt that effective conflict-prevention strategies and successful efforts to fight international terrorism are inextricably intertwined. Conflict-ridden regions around the globe have proved to be easy breeding grounds and havens for terrorist activities. For us to win the battle against international terrorism, it is also imperative that we make resolute efforts to find durable solutions to the conflicts that are raging throughout the world.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to conclude by reaffirming Botswana's unflinching resolve to cooperate with worldwide efforts to address the persistent phenomenon of international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We will continue to follow with keen interest the work of the Legal Committee on this matter and the deliberations of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a> of 17 December 1996 in its efforts to elaborate a draft convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism, as well as other means of comprehensively addressing this problem.</div>
	<div class="p">I should also like to recall the collective position of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries that the emerging challenges presented by the phenomenon of international terrorism cannot be ignored and need to be addressed at the highest possible level. As called for in paragraph 14 of General Assembly <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-55-158">resolution 55/158</a> of 12 December 2000, in this regard we would like to encourage the Ad Hoc Committee to seriously address the question of convening a high-level conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, to formulate a joint, organized response by the international community to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The tragic events of 11 September shocked the people of Latvia, who greatly respect human rights, international law and the right to live without fear. On behalf of the Government of Latvia, I extend my country's condolences and sympathies to the Government of the United States and to the American people. We share the pain of the families of the victims of this brutal act of terrorism. Our Government declared 13 September a day of mourning.</div>
	<div class="p">We would also like to express our condolences to the State of Israel and the Russian Federation for the tragic accident that took place yesterday over the Black Sea.</div>
	<div class="p">The Latvian delegation aligns itself with the statement made by the Presidency of the European Union on agenda item 166, "Measures to eliminate international terrorism". We also welcome the initiative of the European Union to have this item debated in the plenary General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The recent terrorist attacks were not only aimed against the people of America and the city of New York, which has been the home of the United Nations for more than 50 years. It was a strike against humanity and the universal values for which the United Nations stands. Like every other act of terrorism, this is a challenge to international society as a whole, as well as to each and every one of us. Therefore, we, as the United Nations, must act unanimously, deliberately and without delay so as to agree upon and implement measures to eliminate international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Innocent people are reduced to objects in brutal terrorist acts. Terrorists do not discriminate among their victims. The victims of terrorists are the people all around us: children, men and women -- people of all nationalities and religions. No crime is too horrible for terrorists.</div>
	<div class="p">The primary task of the United Nations is to maintain peace and security. As we are convinced that terrorism is a prime threat to peace and security, we have to be united in our words and deeds so as to prevent and suppress terrorist acts. We are all aware that terrorism has no face, borders, nationality or religion. To succeed in combating terrorism, therefore, we must act on all levels: global, regional and national.</div>
	<div class="p">Latvia strongly welcomes and supports Security Council resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">1368 (2001)</a> and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">1373 (2001)</a>, setting out principles and measures to combat terrorism at all levels. Latvia is convinced that the full and unconditional implementation of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is imperative if we are to succeed in suppressing terrorism.The financing of terrorism has to be prevented and eliminated. Any action or inaction by States or individuals allowing the practice of terrorism has to be stopped. Cooperation and exchanges of information among States concerning terrorist activities have to be strengthened. Latvia welcomes the establishment of the Security Council Committee to monitor the implementation of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Latvia is taking all the necessary measures to implement Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. First, a high-level Task Force chaired by the Prime Minister of Latvia has been created to coordinate national efforts against terrorism in the following areas: preventing financing of terrorism; enhancing information exchanges on terrorism; tightening border control; enhancing the control of strategic goods; and increasing crisis management capacity.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, Latvia is committed to accelerating the adoption and implementation of international conventions and protocols against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, we are coordinating our actions with our Estonian and Lithuanian friends.</div>
	<div class="p">National efforts have to be welded into a global framework. We urge all States to accede to the existing body of international law relating to the elimination of terrorism. Latvia fully supports accelerating the drafting and implementation of conventions on global terrorism and nuclear terrorism. We are convinced that this is a priority for the Sixth Committee and the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Also, my country fully supports the initiative to convene a high-level international event on combating terrorism within the framework of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">The debate in the General Assembly this week has shown that no country is a mere observer in the fight against terrorism. No country is capable of individually suppressing terrorism; international cooperation, the commitment of the United Nations and the political will of all nations are required. To achieve sustainable results in annihilating terrorism, joint international action is mandatory. More than ever before, the international community must be united in its commitment. Latvia believes that the elimination of terrorism is within our reach. We will contribute resources to vindicating and sustaining democracy, the rule of law and justice.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Tekle" nation="Eritrea" language="">
	Mr. Tekle (Eritrea)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The Eritrean delegation is taking the floor for the first time during this session. Therefore, Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to extend congratulations to you on your election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am certain that your remarkable experience and expertise will lead our deliberations to a successful conclusion.</div>
	<div class="p">On 11 September, Eritreans witnessed with horror, shock and disbelief, then in anger, and finally with grief, pain and anguish, the reprehensible act of terrorism that caused the sudden loss of several thousand innocent and unsuspecting human beings from about 60 countries going peacefully about their daily routines. I wish once again to extend our sincere condolences to the people and the Government of the United States, in whose country the crime was committed and who have suffered the greatest loss, as well as to those other countries whose citizens have lost their dear ones. Needless to say, Eritreans condemn this heinous crime in the strongest terms possible.</div>
	<div class="p">Eritrea, which has benefited from United States assistance and cooperation in its own struggle against terrorism since the early days of its independence, takes this opportunity to reiterate its solidarity with the people and the Government of the United States. It also reaffirms its firm commitment to participate in any effort that seeks to bring the perpetrators of this infamy to justice, to eradicate the scourge of terrorism and to ensure that similar crimes against humanity are never again committed.</div>
	<div class="p">Eritreans know from bitter experience that the international community has been plagued by, and has had to endure, terrorism for quite a while. In fact, terrorism had already become an ominous threat to international peace, security and stability, as well as to socio-economic development, when Eritrea joined the international community as a sovereign State. Not long after, the young nation was to become one of the prime victims of terrorism. At that time, it realized that terrorism had no religion, race, ethnicity or nationality and that it only exploited them to achieve certain nefarious ends. It also realized that no country could be immune to terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">During 1995 and 1996, in particular, a terrorist organization with a multinational membership had begun to terrorize Eritreans and visitors from abroad along one of our country's borders. Among its despicable crimes was the cold-blooded murder in 1996 of five Belgian tourists and the Eritreans who were with them. It was for this reason that Eritrea made the war against terrorism one of the cornerstones of its nascent foreign policy.</div>
	<div class="p">It soon became evident to the Government of the new State that, first of all, terrorism represented an intricate international web of actors who shared some ill-conceived and evil ideology anchored in hate and bigotry, preaching violence, and with abundant support from a multiplicity of financial sources; and, secondly, that it was essential to create, in addition to strong national programmes, viable regional and international mechanisms to effectively and credibly combat terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">To this end, by 1994, barely a few months after it became a sovereign State, it had submitted to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) a plan related to the creation of a strong regional coalition to coordinate the fight against terrorism in the Horn of Africa. Additionally, it had submitted a detailed working paper which, incidentally, identified most of the terrorist organizations and leaders in the region, including Osama bin Laden, to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit held in Yaoundé in 1996, which recognized the threat and challenge posed to Africa by terrorism. Thirdly, it also made a great diplomatic effort in Europe and America, with a view to establishing a wider anti-terrorist coalition.</div>
	<div class="p">It is for these reasons that the Eritrean Government fully endorses the recent United Nations resolutions adopted to supplement and strengthen existing ones, particularly Security Council resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">1373 (2001)</a> and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">1368 (2001)</a> and General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1.pdf">resolution 56/1</a>. The new and unprecedented determination reflected in these resolutions to combat terrorism at the international, as well as at the regional and national levels, augurs well for the struggle against the scourge. However, Eritrea also fully recognizes that the adoption of resolutions and the signing of agreements is not enough and that, to be effective, they must be immediately complemented with coordinated and credible action to ensure implementation and compliance by all. The international community must therefore avail itself of this new momentum and determination to create an environment that will protect and promote our new unity of purpose and consolidate our collective will.</div>
	<div class="p">Eritrea is convinced that terrorism cannot be justified or legitimized for any reason or under any circumstances. It is as immoral as it is criminal. It violates basic human rights and human values. It is in fact a crime against humanity. It is an attack on human dignity. It is a justification of hatred, intolerance and violence. It spawns fear and insecurity and anarchy. As such, it must be condemned in all its forms and manifestations and without any reservations.</div>
	<div class="p">It is thus incumbent on the international community to act collectively and decisively to eliminate it. Yet, Eritrea realizes that the war against terrorism cannot be won in the immediate future. Thus, while the international community must, of course, act decisively and forcefully now, it must also prepare a long-term strategy envisaging a broad and sustained effort to ensure the complete eradication of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Eritrea believes that any such international effort must be undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations if only because it has the unique capacity to build a broad consensus and because it already provides a legal framework which may be improved to strengthen any future action that is to be taken.</div>
	<div class="p">Thus, even as we must urgently take the measures set forth in recent General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, in particular Security Council resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">1368 (2001)</a> and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">1373 (2001)</a>, Eritrea also supports the adoption of a comprehensive convention on terrorism and expresses its thanks to India for the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism that it has submitted to the Sixth Committee. In our view, the draft can serve as a good basis for discussion.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, let me reiterate that the international community cannot afford to delay any action against terrorism. We owe it to future generations.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes a major force that poses constant instability and threats to all countries and peoples. It is, therefore, important, in ensuring world peace and security, that effective measures be taken to eliminate terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The large-scale terrorist incident that occurred in the United States on 11 September caught the international community by great surprise. It was also very regrettable and tragic. The incident reminds the international community once again of the gravity of terrorism and calls for deep thought about issues that need to be dealt with in eliminating terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Acts of terrorism result from various political motivations and purposes, and they are committed in an arbitrary and reckless manner. This necessarily requires that the leading role of the United Nations be further enhanced in addressing international issues, including the elimination of terrorism, and that all Member States value the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter and realize effective international cooperation on the basis of the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p">Since terrorism has emerged as a serious international problem, Member States will have to properly find the root cause of terrorism and consider ways and means to cope with it in an effective and practical manner. Member States will have to have a correct concept of what terrorism is and discharge their national obligations to eliminate it. At the same time, they must contribute, in a fair and unbiased way, to the efforts of the international community to eradicate the cause of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The problem of terrorism should be resolved in conformity with the Charter and relevant international law. Mistrust and confrontation between countries and nations should be removed and the principles and ideals of the Charter should be adhered to.</div>
	<div class="p">Applying the label of terrorist to independent States that advocate sovereign equality in international relations, violating the sovereignty of such States and inflicting pain and suffering on their people through armed intervention, occupation, unilateral pressure and sanctions, all should be duly denounced, as this represents State terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea maintains, as ever, its consistent stance of opposing all forms of terrorism and support of any kind for it. We strongly denounce and reject all forms of terrorism, including its organization, assistance, instigation and acquiescence.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation hopes that proper ways and means for eliminating all forms of terrorism will be worked out at this session.</div>

	Ms. Løj (Denmark)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The Danish Government associates itself with the statement made on 1 October by the representative of Belgium on behalf of the European Union.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me once again at this General Assembly session reiterate that Denmark most strongly condemns the forces behind the horrific acts of terrorism in the United States on 11 September 2001. We welcome the resolve of the Security Council to act swiftly and effectively in countering those criminal acts. The Danish Government and the people are fully committed to participating in this united international effort to ensure that those responsible for these attacks are brought to justice and punishment.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is today the single most serious international threat to the peaceful functioning of our societies, exploiting, as it does, the basic values of the free world governed by democracy and the rule of law. International terrorism, as we all witnessed on 11 September, has taken on new dimensions.</div>
	<div class="p">Targeting innocent civilians and thus creating a state of fear or terror in the minds of the general public, is one of the most horrifying criminal acts and cannot be tolerated by the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">No cause can ever justify such cowardly and murderous acts. Terrorism undermines everything it claims to be fighting for. The underlying causes of terrorism must, of course, not be ignored, but must be properly addressed. Combating international terrorism cannot, however, await a solution to the underlying tensions.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is a crime, whether committed in times of peace or during armed conflict. All appropriate means must be pursued to bring the perpetrators to justice, here and now. The international community, in its own interest, should work together in this endeavour. Steps must be taken to eradicate terrorism. In this regard, the United Nations has a crucial role to play.</div>
	<div class="p">The Danish Government welcomes the immediate response by the United Nations to the terrorist attacks against the United States: Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">resolution 1368 (2001)</a> and General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1.pdf">resolution 56/1</a>, both of 12 September. Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, adopted on 28 September, constitutes timely and most appropriate guidance to Member States in their actual and future work in combating terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The Danish Government has, as an immediate follow-up to these United Nations resolutions, initiated a careful implementation process. That is being done in close cooperation with our partners in the European Union as well as by national initiatives. The initiatives required will, among other things, encompass legislation to prevent and roll up the financing of terrorism, changes to the Danish Criminal Code and the Aliens Act and implementation of extended provisions to extradite terrorists, as well as law initiatives to strengthen efforts against smuggling of human beings and money laundering. At the opening of the Danish Parliament on 2 October, the Prime Minister indicated that necessary legislation will be presented to Parliament within 60 days, and underlined the need for urgent action.</div>
	<div class="p">As reaffirmed by the European Council on 21 September, it is the belief of the European Heads of State and Government that the United Nations, with its unique and universal mandate, is a fundamental player in the fight against international terrorism and must act accordingly.</div>
	<div class="p">However, while focusing on the fight against terrorism, we must not forget other major challenges facing us: the eradication of poverty; protection of all human rights; democratization; and the promotion of good governance and the rule of law. All Governments, civil societies and the United Nations must work together. The United Nations can be instrumental in our effort. But renewed political will is necessary. Further resources need to be allocated. Domestic and international commitments must go hand in hand in order to have sufficient impact. In this respect, let me also mention the need of the many refugees in developing countries. The provision of humanitarian assistance is fundamental. This is closely linked to the prevention of conflicts and to establishing and maintaining international peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p">Denmark has ratified 11 out of 12 United Nations conventions dealing with the fight against various aspects of terrorism. On 25 September we signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Steps are being taken to ratify this Convention as soon as possible -- hopefully, before the end of this year.</div>
	<div class="p">Among further steps to be taken by the United Nations in the fight against international terrorism is the early completion of a comprehensive convention. In this context, we should consider how we might effectively bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of international terrorism -- for instance, by developing an international mechanism for the effective prosecution and punishment of those responsible. In any event, we must all work closely together to ensure that terrorists will not find safe haven anywhere in the world -- in other words, that those participating in terrorist activities will be either prosecuted or extradited, wherever they set foot. There can be no concessions to terrorists or their sponsors.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to pledge the support of Denmark in the struggle against international terrorism and in the search for solutions to its underlying causes.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="13-8">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Buallay" nation="Bahrain" language="Arabic">
	Mr. Buallay (Bahrain)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">As my delegation is addressing the Assembly for the first time, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President. I am confident that your diplomatic skills will reflect positively on our deliberations. I cannot fail to express our appreciation to Minister Holkeri for his presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.</div>
	<div class="p">At the outset, I should like to express the condemnation by the Government and people of the State of Bahrain of the acts of terrorism perpetrated in the United States of America on 11 September 2001, which resulted in so many innocent victims. We condemn any act of terrorism, whoever perpetrates it and whatever the reasons and motivations, because terrorism and acts of terrorism are anathema to the teachings of our lofty religion. They run counter to the most fundamental values and human principles calling for the renunciation of all acts and forms of terrorism, for establishing peace among peoples and for the protection of their rights.</div>
	<div class="p">Many efforts have been made to combat terrorism and eliminate it. Many initiatives have been taken in this framework by many international and governmental organs. Regional and international conventions have been drafted to combat terrorism. Many resolutions condemning terrorism anywhere and in all its forms have been adopted. In this regard, the General Assembly, by <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a>, adopted on 17 December 1996, established the Ad Hoc Committee to draft a convention on suppressing acts of international terrorism. However, differences of opinion among members of the Committee prevented agreement on the text of a draft convention. It is noteworthy that Arab States were at the forefront in tabling initiatives for combating terrorism and in calling for the convening of an international conference under the aegis of the United Nations to eliminate all forms of terrorism, whether perpetrated by individuals, groups or States.</div>
	<div class="p">How far international efforts succeed in addressing terrorism greatly depends on many issues, including the following points.</div>
	<div class="p">First, terrorism needs to be clearly defined, in a manner agreed by the international community, in order to ascertain the reasons and factors leading to terrorism and to the means to punish its perpetrators. In defining terrorism, we must draw attention to the need to differentiate between terrorism and the legitimate struggle against and resistance to occupation, as is the case for the Palestinian people struggling to liberate its usurped land and recover it from its occupier.</div>
	<div class="p">Occupying the land of others by force is among the most serious forms of terrorism. Such occupation is State terrorism, which has wider ranging and more pervasive consequences. The entire world must therefore condemn the acts perpetrated by Israel in terrorizing Palestinian land.</div>
	<div class="p">Such acts of terrorism are also reflected in the killing of innocent people -- unarmed children, old and young people. Those people are uprooted and their homes destroyed. In addition, every sort of modern sophisticated weapon is used against them; and that is to say nothing of the fact that such acts embroil the entire region in a vicious cycle of violence. We therefore believe that international efforts must be mobilized to find a solution to the question of Palestine so as to restore stability and peace in the region.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, it must always be stressed that terrorism does not belong to a specific religion, civilization or culture. Terrorism is an aberrant act that exists in every human society. There must therefore be no linkage between terrorism and Islam, which advocates peace and friendship among all peoples of the world. We must not allow such a linkage to light the fuse of conflict between religions and civilizations.</div>
	<div class="p">It is regrettable that, at a time when many voices are being raised in the Islamic world calling for a dialogue among civilizations, we hear some voices in some States speak of the superiority of Western culture and civilization over Islamic culture and civilization. It is also regrettable that some media in some States should wage campaigns aimed at distorting the image of Arabs and Muslims and linking Islam and terrorism. This is a grave attack on Islam and Muslims. We believe that sowing the seeds of hatred among peoples is no less serious or dangerous than acts of terrorism themselves. That is the cause of conflict and extremism, and has the potential to damage humanity as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, as terrorism has political, economic and social roots, we believe that dealing with those causes and finding successful solutions to them are essential to eradicating it. We must not allow those factors to be exploited in the commission of acts of terrorism that lead to such tragic events as the ones we witnessed recently against the United States of America and its people.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, my delegation hopes that the General Assembly will adopt resolutions that reflect the opinions expressed by various delegations about terrorism and the means of responding in order to eradicate it.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="14-10">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Kamara" nation="Sierra Leone" language="">
	Mr. Kamara (Sierra Leone)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">My delegation congratulates you and your friendly country, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your leadership of this session will be productive and fruitful.</div>
	<div class="p">Before I proceed any further, let me convey to our American colleagues and to the Government and people of the United States our shock and condolences at the loss of thousands of innocent lives resulting from the cowardly attacks in Washington, Pennsylvania and New York. Those despicable acts make this debate extremely timely and appropriate.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government and people of Sierra Leone reaffirm at the highest level their unequivocal condemnation of all terrorist acts, methods and practices as being criminal and unjustifiable, whenever, wherever and by whomsoever they are committed. The despicable acts committed in the United States on 11 September 2001 directly remind all Sierra Leoneans of the catastrophic events that took place on 6 January 1999, when in an attack on Freetown 5,000 innocent civilians lost their lives in a senseless onslaught. The Government and people of Sierra Leone have had their own share of living with terrorism during a decade-long struggle with the rebel forces of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the mayhem they have perpetrated on the peace-loving citizens of our nation.</div>
	<div class="p">In that regard, my delegation supports the position of the Non-Aligned Movement on international terrorism expressed in the Durban Declaration. While we support the legitimate struggles of peoples all over the world for independence and dignity, we condemn attacks on innocent civilians as cowardly and despicable crimes against the peace and security of mankind.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation believes that the focus must now turn to establishing a precise and comprehensive definition of international terrorism. We all know what it is, but that is not enough. We must demonstrate the political will and commitment to agree on a definition. We have done this in the context of regional conventions like those of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). We now urgently need to do so the same at international level through the aegis of the United Nations, possibly through a conference of plenipotentiaries.</div>
	<div class="p">Defining the scourge of international terrorism is not enough. We must also engage ourselves in finding solutions to the problems that the terrorists use to justify their actions. Our involvement must be seen to be fair, just, transparent and neutral. We must not allow ourselves to be seen as supporting without mitigation only one side of a conflict -- for that, rightly or wrongly, gives succour to those who engaged in the abominable acts we witnessed in the United States on 11 September 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">It must be the commitment of the entire international community to bring to justice those who kill innocent people in acts of terrorism. For example, if there is prima facie evidence that an individual or a certain group is involved in the commission of acts of terrorism, they must be brought before national or international courts to account for their crimes against humanity, war crimes and, possibly, acts of genocide. Certain entities, for example, do not have credible legal systems that meet the international standards of justice and transparency. In such case, therefore, the individual or select group must be handed over to a country that has the legal infrastructure to try those involved in the commission of the crime.</div>
	<div class="p">This debate shows the importance of having in place an international criminal court. My delegation believes that the crimes committed on 11 September in the United States would fall within the jurisdiction of the Court. All of us present here today must work arduously for the coming into operation of the Court.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations must be assisted in proscribing international acts of terrorism. The United Nations must, under Chapter VIII of the Charter, give regional organizations and agencies the mandate to deal with matters relating to international peace and security. Acts of terrorism are such matters that threaten international peace and security. However, for a Chapter-VIII mandate to be carried out effectively, the United Nations must provide regional organizations and agencies with the requisite resources to carry out that mandate.</div>
	<div class="p">A network of major conventions to prevent and suppress terrorism has been adopted. Despite those conventions, acts of terrorism continue, for rogue States persistently continue to frustrate the will of the international community. That is why we particularly welcomed the adoption of Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> on 28 September 2001. It is an added measure to combat international terrorism which provides that all States must endeavour to prevent and suppress the commission of acts of terrorism in all forms and manifestations.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation insists that those States which continue to provide support and solace to terrorists must be swiftly and definitively punished. They must be sanctioned, and their political and military leaders must be held individually responsible for crimes committed by the perpetrators.</div>
	<div class="p">We reiterate our condemnation of all forms and manifestations of terrorism. We will support the international efforts, aided by national political will and commitment, that are required to suppress acts of terrorism. We will cooperate with all other members in the achievement of that common goal.</div>

	<div class="p">Since this is the first time that Estonia has taken the floor since the horrific events here in the United States on 11 September, please allow me to reiterate to the United States, to the American people and to the families of all the innocent victims the deepest condolences of the Government and the people of Estonia.</div>
	<div class="p">Because Estonia, as an associated country of the European Union, has aligned with Union's common statement, I shall be very brief.</div>
	<div class="p">First of all, let me assure the Assembly that Estonia is giving full support to action in the United Nations to ensure that no one, whether a State or an individual, supports, finances or harbours terrorism. Clearly, under the circumstances, the use of multilateral institutions as a common platform for action has become more important than ever. But it is also more evident than ever that in order to be successful in achieving our common goals in the fight against terrorism, enhanced cooperation is vitally needed at all possible levels of society. In that context we would like to stress the importance of strengthening regional and subregional cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p">With that in mind, Estonia, together with its Baltic neighbour States, has taken concrete steps to strengthen cooperation among our countries by working out a package of joint measures in response to the terrorist attacks against the United States. That package contains practical joint measures in the humanitarian aid, security, military and, last but not least, legal fields.</div>
	<div class="p">But besides that joint package with our neighbours, my Government has also worked out a detailed list of Estonia's preliminary measures for an enhanced fight against terrorism. One of the priorities on that list is enhancing the rule of law. Estonia quickly speeded up the process of ratifying the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. In a few days, on 9 October, the ratification process for both of those important legal instruments will reach its final stage in our Parliament.</div>
	<div class="p">We are also reviewing our national legislation and normative acts to make sure that they provide the legal basis and tools to prevent and, if necessary, to respond to terrorism. But legal instruments alone are not sufficient. A strong commitment by States and genuine cooperation among Governments and their law enforcement institutions are what is needed for efficient action.</div>
	<div class="p">Our strength is in unity. Let us provide our common fight with all the necessary tools by ensuring that the best possible coordination of anti-terrorist measures, backed by enhanced information exchange among all allies and partners, becomes a reality.</div>

	<div class="p">I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to your post, with its great responsibilities, and wish you all success.</div>
	<div class="p">As one of the ugliest phenomena of our time, terrorism is no new concept: mankind has faced it from time immemorial. But the dangerous trend towards an expansion of its scope beyond regional borders, along with the dire consequences of terrorist acts, have made it a genuine threat to the peace and security of all mankind. We cannot exclude the real threat of nuclear terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Increasingly frequent terrorist acts in their most varied and horrific forms -- bombings, drug terrorism, air hijacking, hostage-taking, religious fanaticism -- have taken thousands of innocent lives and have destabilized the foundations of societies, causing panic and chaos, undermining the economies of victim countries and posing a threat to the bases of international peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p">The cruelty and dire consequences of the 11 September events in New York shook the entire world community. We in Turkmenistan met with deep sorrow the tragic events in the United States of America. The leadership and the people of Turkmenistan share the suffering of the people of the United States and convey their condolences to the families and friends of those who died.</div>
	<div class="p">Our country has sternly condemned the perpetration of terrorist acts. It is perfectly clear that the evil, which has cost thousands of innocent lives, must be punished. We must take urgent steps to eliminate the possibility that such tragedies will be repeated. We must root out terrorism in each and every country.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Human values must be reliably protected from the infringement of dark forces. Here there is no alternative but close cooperation by States under the auspices of the United Nations. In this connection, we fully endorse the Secretary-General's view that the United Nations is the only forum for establishing a global coalition, as only in this way can we lend global legitimacy to the long-term struggle against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Close international cooperation is required to suppress and eliminate terrorism and its consequences and to ensure the right to life, to freedom and to personal security. Turkmenistan supports the establishment of an international anti-terrorist coalition. As a State whose neutral status is recognized by the international community through the United Nations, Turkmenistan deems it appropriate that such a coalition be a permanent body of the United Nations and that it carry out its activities under the auspices of the Organization, with clearly stated goals, tasks, functions, powers and working machinery. Its existence within the United Nations, in close cooperation with all States and international organizations, would allow for the establishment of a system that would ensure that any manifestation of terrorism anywhere in the world will not go unpunished, and would allow us also to take effective measures to combat it.</div>
	<div class="p">We are also in favour of the initiative of the Non-Aligned Movement to convene an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations in order to pool international efforts and coordinate the positions of States, with the goal of suppressing and eliminating terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism, regardless of the reasons behind the commission of terrorist acts or of the goals of their masterminds, is a terrible crime that contravenes the Charter of the United Nations and represents the gravest of infringements on the rights and freedoms of the human being.</div>
	<div class="p">In this connection, we need to increase the number of legal instruments that give a concrete definition of terrorism and consequently specify how it should be punished. The most reliable instrument for this purpose would be a comprehensive international convention on international terrorism - work on which must be sped up. Turkmenistan's neutral status, entered into as an international obligation, means that our country's action in the international arena is in strict compliance with the Charter of the United Nations. On this basis, Turkmenistan's policies have always strictly adhered to United Nations guidelines, and it has always cooperated with other members of the world community and international organizations.</div>
	<div class="p">We can and we must fight against terrorism, but Turkmenistan believes that the campaign against international terrorism requires a careful, well-thought-out approach. All steps and actions designed to eliminate hotbeds of international terrorism must be targeted ones. They should do no harm to innocent people; they should be in keeping with the norms of international law; and they should not lead to a destabilization of the situation in the region.</div>
	<div class="p">Turkmenistan attaches great importance to international conventions against terrorism as a legal instrument to combat this modern-day scourge, and, accordingly, it has acceded to the majority of such instruments or is working to do so. We have taken a number of practical steps pursuant to international conventions, as is reflected in our national legislation and legislative proposals.</div>
	<div class="p">In the context of current events, we would like to point out the following. For 22 years now, a war has been waged in the long-suffering land of Afghanistan. Turkmenistan, while not interfering in the internal affairs of neighbourly fraternal Afghanistan, has done a great deal to organize peace talks, under the auspices of the United Nations, among the warring parties. We once again express our hope that an effective negotiation process will be possible. In spite of all of the developments, the United Nations, as an impartial Organization, must play a central, coordinating role in inter-Afghan talks.</div>
	<div class="p">In this connection, the President of Turkmenistan, Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov, proposed, during this terrible time, the establishment of a special United Nations office in Ashkhabad, which would take the initiative of organizing a mission with the goal of finding a mutually acceptable solution to the problem.</div>
	<div class="p">Turkmenistan, in an immediate reaction to the tragedy, offered to lend humanitarian assistance to the civilian population of Afghanistan, first and foremost to women and children, who have been feeling the brunt of the consequences of terrorism. Working closely with United Nations agencies, and the United States Government, we are receiving humanitarian deliveries of medicines, foodstuffs and basic necessities, and we are establishing all of the necessary conditions for their dispatch to Afghanistan.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the strengthening of international cooperation within the framework of the United Nations is a prerequisite for the successful resolution of the complex international problems we face. The ideals and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations must be defended, and that is why we must strictly condemn all acts of terrorism and join the efforts of the international community to combat it. This is the only real force capable of combating terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Neutral Turkmenistan reaffirms its determination actively to cooperate within the framework of the United Nations for the full eradication of terrorism.</div>

	Mr. Adechi (Benin)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The delegation of Benin, on whose behalf I have the honour to speak, is pleased to be able to take the floor on the agenda item now before us on the consideration of measures aimed at eliminating international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">We also welcome the initiative of the European Union to propose the consideration, in plenary of the General Assembly, of the highly important and disturbing question of international terrorism. The consideration of this issue by the General Assembly reflects the unanimous condemnation of the barbaric and retrograde acts committed on 11 September 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">The debate we have had over the past three days in plenary have underscored -- though that emphasis was hardly necessary -- the threat that terrorism poses to the security of States and to the progress of humankind.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe that the consideration of this item at a time when preparatory work is under way on the creation of International Criminal Court is a sign for the future.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Benin has expressed the full solidarity of the people of Benin with the people of the United States, whose grief and sorrow we share, and has forcefully condemned this heinous attack, which struck America but is also a threat to the entire world.</div>
	<div class="p">Since this year is devoted to the promotion of a dialogue among civilizations, the terrorist attack of 11 September could not have been more untimely. That is why the international community must show its resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms, as it represents a threat to the coherence of human communities.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism also violates the fundamental principles of the Charter and runs counter to the legitimate aspirations of peoples to build a world of peace, of solidarity and of progress.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism violates the fundamental principles of human rights and thereby constitutes a threat to the coherence of our societies and to democracy, above all to emerging or fragile democracies.</div>
	<div class="p">Benin is therefore deeply concerned at the increase in terrorist acts throughout the world. Convinced that no motive can rightly be invoked to justify such acts, Benin has always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Indeed, no civilization, no culture, no religion advocates or justifies such extremist and barbaric behaviour.</div>
	<div class="p">It seems clear today that the links between terrorism and transnational crime are strengthening and becoming globalized, making all illicit trade lucrative, ranging from prostitution and the exploitation of vulnerable groups of our societies to the illicit trade in small arms and precious metals.</div>
	<div class="p">When a threat is global and multidimensional, the response must be global and diversified. Terrorism is not an isolated phenomenon. It is the result of political manipulation, but it is also fuelled by long-disregarded frustrations stemming from social inequality, marginalization and exclusion.</div>
	<div class="p">In a way, the terrorists are a violent mirror of the dysfunction of our human community. We must therefore return, once the primacy of law is restored, to seeking together the causes and circumstances that lead to acts as desperate as they are criminal and unjustifiable.</div>
	<div class="p">At the national and international levels, we shall have to consider the preventive side of our action in order to eradicate this scourge once and for all. Such an undertaking can succeed only through the combined efforts of the entire international community. The heads of State and Government, meeting at the Millennium Summit last year, reiterated their commitment to undertaking concerted action to conquer terrorism in accordance with the relevant international conventions. The United Nations, through its mission and composition, is the ideal and legitimate forum for coordinating the mobilization and action of the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">Benin has assured the Government of the United States of America of its readiness to do all in its power to cooperate bilaterally in the fight against terrorism. Benin will also work constructively with the other Members of the Organization to find a lasting solution to this scourge. We are convinced that, through solidarity, cooperation and the effective implementation of the relevant international instruments, we will succeed. That is why welcome India's initiative of submitting a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism, as recommended in <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-54-110">resolution 54/110</a>. Along the same lines, we urge that obstacles to the adoption of the convention on the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism be promptly removed.</div>
	<div class="p">The fight against terrorism will be long and arduous. We must therefore be resolute in overcoming the difficulties along the way. In that respect, we have no choice but to define unambiguously the concept of terrorism if we wish to maintain and strengthen the broad mobilization to win this struggle. That is the price we must pay to strengthen peace and security throughout the world. That is the price we must pay to bequeath to future generations a world free of fear and threats to the survival of humankind.</div>

	Mr. Singhara Na Ayudhaya (Thailand)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I should like to begin by adding my voice to all those that have spoken before me in expressing once again our deepest sympathies to the families of the more than 6,000 Americans and other nationals, including Thais, who lost their lives in the tragedy of 11 September 2001. No one can understand both the sorrow and the outrage better than Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, who spoke to us on 1 October. At the same time, his leadership during the darkest hours of this city and his words of fortitude during his address symbolize the resilience of the people of New York and the United States in the face of international terrorism and their determination to move forward. As a fellow New Yorker, I pay tribute to the Mayor and to all the people he represents.</div>
	<div class="p">Our meeting takes place amidst a flurry of activities that have been going on here in the United Nations and elsewhere as the international community closes ranks to fight against the common threat posed to international peace and security by international terrorism. As we deliberate on possible future courses of action, I should like to reiterate very clearly where we stand.</div>
	<div class="p">We condemn in the strongest terms such acts of terrorism as were perpetrated in the United States on 11 September 2001. We join the United Nations in calling for international cooperation to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these outrages and we will join any international coalition to combat terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Already, the General Assembly has adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1.pdf">resolution 56/1</a> on 12 September, of which we are proud to be a part, and the Security Council has adopted resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">1368 (2001)</a> and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">1373 (2001)</a> on 12 and 28 September, respectively. These are welcome developments. In the view of my delegation, the implications of these General Assembly and Security Council resolutions are clear.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community is united in the universal condemnation of those responsible for the tragedy and the terrorism that they represent. Nevertheless, this unity must be sustained as we move from condemnation of terrorist acts to cooperation to fight terrorism. As the Secretary-General reminded us on 1 October,</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Terrorism will be defeated if the international community summons the will to unite in a broad coalition, or it will not be defeated at all." (<i><a href="../pdf/A-56-PV.12.pdf">A/56/PV.12</a></i>)</div>
	<div class="p">It is our hope that this coalition will be as broad and as universal as possible, embracing the full spectrum of humanity.</div>
	<div class="p">But what is equally important is that these resolutions, particularly those of the Security Council, have virtually eliminated any notion of so-called neutrality from the fight against terrorism. We have a clear, international obligation, as Members of the United Nations, to cooperate with one another to fight against terrorism. If Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">resolution 1368 (2001)</a> laid down the principles in this struggle, Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> created the framework. The scope of this framework is indeed comprehensive, covering cooperation in the financial, immigration, operational information and other areas. We will now need to examine, in close consultations with Member States, how this cooperation can be most effectively operationalized.</div>
	<div class="p">On our part, we have already extended our cooperation to the international community through our existing laws, such as those on mutual assistance in criminal matters, in the form of information exchange and intelligence sharing. Our immigration policies and procedures are being reviewed and reinforced. In addition, Thailand is taking all necessary steps to ensure that the relevant Security Council resolutions, including those relating to the financing of terrorist acts, are effectively carried out. These should play an important role in facilitating the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Security Council resolutions designed to cut off the financial bases of terrorists and terrorist organizations.</div>
	<div class="p">For our part, Thailand is now party to the four hijacking conventions and in the process of considering accession to other conventions relating to terrorism, in particular the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, as called for in <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. But the key word is cooperation, and that requires that we be given the appropriate assistance and support, including technical, financial or informational, so that the cooperation can be as effective as possible.</div>
	<div class="p">As we move forward together in our common struggle against international terrorism, I should like to address four points in the broader scheme of things which, I hope, the international community will bear in mind.</div>
	<div class="p">First, let us recognize that the scourge of terrorism, like a hydra, has many heads, linking it to many other spheres of illegal and criminal activities. As stated in Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, there are close connections between international terrorism and illicit drugs, transnational organized crime and money laundering, to name a few. To deal with them effectively requires coordinated efforts against all these activities. Illicit drug production and trafficking, in many cases, generate the enormous financial resources that help make terrorism such a formidable foe. All the measures to tackle the financial networks of terrorist organizations will not be so effective if the sources of the financial flows are not effectively dealt with. The drug producer or drug trafficker is a terrorist in his actions just as much as the person holding the gun.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, let us accept that if terrorism is a threat for all of humanity, then all members of the international community should continue to be given the opportunity to contribute in charting the course of action humanity intends to take in this common struggle. In this connection, we should recognize the important role the General Assembly can play in these endeavours. For example, the work of the Ad Hoc Committee to, inter alia, develop a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, currently being undertaken within the framework of the Sixth Committee, should be accelerated and supported. We commend the Secretary-General for drawing attention to this point in his report on measures to eliminate international terrorism in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-160">A/56/160</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, let us realize what the coalescence of this broad coalition of States against terrorism is telling us: no State can tackle problems, especially those of a global nature, by itself. In this globalized world, there is simply no better alternative than multilateralism. One would be hard pressed to find a more effective mechanism for tackling such global problems than the type of close, dynamic cooperation and goodwill among States and peoples that multilateralism engenders.</div>
	<div class="p">And lastly, let us remind ourselves that for all the horror and revulsion that terrorism brings to its victims, we should not forget our own humanity in dealing with the problem. In fighting terrorism, we should not encroach on the civil liberties of individuals or on the human rights of people that are guaranteed by our laws and nurtured by our commitment to democratic values. In fighting against terrorism, we should not succumb to paranoia or xenophobia, which would result in greater mistrust amongst States and peoples. Terrorism is a global phenomenon that is not identified with any group of people, particular region or faith. It is faceless and, indeed, faithless.</div>
	<div class="p">Thailand stands ready to cooperate with the international community and the United Nations to eliminate international terrorism in order to make our world safer for humanity.</div>

	<div class="p">As I join the debate on this very critical issue, allow me to congratulate the President on his the election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I am confident that the Assembly will benefit from his leadership and guidance as Member States strive to improve the performance of this unique Organization as it continues to serve the peoples of the world.</div>
	<div class="p">Barbados associates itself fully with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Dominica on behalf of the member States of the Caribbean Community.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Barbados joins other members of the international community in expressing its utter abhorrence of the barbaric terrorist attacks perpetrated against the United States of America on 11 September 2001. As a democratic and peace-loving country, Barbados strongly condemns terrorism in all of its manifestations, particularly when it results in the loss of human life. The use of terrorism as a means to an end has no place in the modern world of tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to which we as Member States of the United Nations are committed.</div>
	<div class="p">Barbados therefore joins the international community in supporting the call for the perpetrators of this ignominious crime to be identified, apprehended and brought swiftly to justice. We also pledge our cooperation in the sustained global effort which will be needed in the months and years ahead to deal effectively with this very grave threat to international peace and security. For we firmly believe that terrorism is a global problem which necessitates a global response.</div>
	<div class="p">Like other members of the international community, Barbados fully supports Security Council resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">1368 (2001)</a> and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">1373 (2001)</a> and General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1.pdf">resolution 56/1</a>, as well as the resolution on "Strengthening hemispheric cooperation to prevent, combat, and eliminate terrorism", adopted at the meeting of consultation of the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States on 21 September, and is committed to their implementation.</div>
	<div class="p">We are also painfully aware, from our own experience, that no country, however small, is immune to terrorism. Indeed, small countries are particularly vulnerable because they frequently do not have the logistical and intelligence assets to effectively track the activities of terrorists and other agents of transnational crime. It is for this reason that the exchange of information is critical if we are to enjoy any success in this fight. For its part, the Government of Barbados will continue its cooperation in exchanging information with law enforcement authorities of other jurisdictions in an effort to ensure that terrorists do not find a safe haven in our country. Barbados is equally committed to ensuring that its national territory is not used by terrorists to launch or to finance the launching of attacks against third countries. We have therefore instituted enhanced security measures at our air and sea ports.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, Barbados is willing to join with all other Member States to elaborate appropriate measures capable of harmonizing the approach of the international community in relation to terrorism. To this end, we look forward to the development of appropriate standards through which internationally accepted legal norms may be applied in the fight against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Last week Barbados, along with other member States of the Caribbean Community, participated in a signing ceremony which had been arranged long before 11 September. I had the privilege of signing, on behalf of the Government of Barbados, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, as well as the supplementary Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition.</div>
	<div class="p">As a country whose economy is heavily dependent on tourism, Barbados is well aware of the importance of providing a safe and secure environment not only for Barbadians but also for those foreign nationals who visit our shores or reside in Barbados.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to stress in the strongest terms possible that Barbados has no intention of allowing its financial services sector to be used as a conduit for the financing of the activities of terrorists or any other international criminal elements. From its inception, the Barbados financial services sector has operated within a strict legal and regulatory framework. Long before 11 September, Barbados sought to ensure that its international financial sector met international standards in respect of regulation, supervision and other anti-money-laundering measures. In this context, we have scrupulously adhered to the guidelines laid down by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, which is affiliated to the Financial Action Task Force. We have enacted anti-money-laundering legislation, and last year established an anti-money-laundering authority, which is serviced by a financial intelligence unit. We will continue to cooperate fully with our bilateral partners and with ongoing regional and international anti-money-laundering efforts.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like at this stage to say a special word about the great city of New York, which is home to thousands of immigrants from my country, at least two of whom tragically lost their lives at the World Trade Center on 11 September. New York is also a home away from home for the thousands of diplomats and Secretariat staff of all nationalities and faiths who serve at the United Nations and represent their countries in the collective pursuit of world peace, human well-being and prosperity. We therefore share with all New Yorkers a personal sense of loss and outrage, and a determination never to let terror win.</div>
	<div class="p">The economic impact of these dreadful events is being felt not just by New York and the United States, but by every nation around the world, especially the smallest and most vulnerable. Coping with the economic consequences of 11 September is a shared problem which will also require priority international attention in the coming weeks and months.</div>
	<div class="p">We all know the famous warning that in order for evil to prevail all that is needed is for good men -- and, dare I say, good women -- to do nothing. Evil showed its face on 11 September. We are, however, confident that, with the combined efforts of the international community, the evil of terrorism will not prevail.</div>

	<div class="p">I would like to join other delegations in congratulating Mr. Han on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.</div>
	<div class="p">I would also like to express our deepest condolences to the American people, and especially to the families of those who lost their lives as a result of the terrorist attacks in the United States. We would also like to express our appreciation to Mayor Giuliani for his speech in which he shared with us the fundamental values of humanity. Recent events in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania have, unfortunately, shown the magnitude of the hard work that still lies ahead of us in building a better world.</div>
	<div class="p">The tragedy of 11 September suddenly raised one very important issue that has obviously been neglected to date: international terrorism. Even though fighting international terrorism has been discussed in many forums, including the General Assembly, for several years, we have failed to ensure the appropriate and comprehensive implementation of the many conventions, treaties and resolutions that have been adopted to deal with this problem. A comprehensive approach has to be taken to fighting international terrorism at the global, regional and national levels, and this should, of course, include legal, political and economic aspects.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully committed to the efforts of the international community to achieve the ultimate goal of eradicating international terrorism. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina has thus already approved a plan of action, and we are pleased to inform the Assembly about it. The Council of Ministers has taken into consideration our obligations, in accordance with Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. A coordinating body has been established to prepare an adequate report for the Security Council about measures and activities relating to the implementation of that resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">Bosnia and Herzegovina plans to sign and ratify the recently adopted International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Amendments to our asylum and immigration law will be finalized and sent on to the Parliamentary Assembly for adoption as a matter of urgency. New security measures will be implemented at all airports, including adjustments in the policy of issuing flight licences, in accordance with relevant international conventions. The State Border Service is being strengthened, and a system for ensuring accurate information about entries and exits at all border crossings is being created. Customs controls are also being strengthened.</div>
	<div class="p">All decisions relating to the issuing of passports and citizenship certificates are being re-examined. A new visa regime is being established that will be in compliance with the standards and criteria of the Schengen visa regime and those of other neighbouring countries. Comprehensive data on all personnel from international, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations is being compiled. In accordance with the provisions of Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1333-2000">resolution 1333 (2000)</a>, we are checking for all accounts and deposits that might belong to individuals and groups linked to international terrorist organizations; if such accounts exist, they will be frozen.</div>
	<div class="p">Reiterating strongly that international terrorism has no roots in any religion, we would like to condemn all the individuals and groups that manipulate religion in an attempt to justify horrible criminal acts. Every religion teaches love among people, not violence and hatred. That means that those who abuse the religious feelings of people are working against God's will.</div>
	<div class="p">The crime of international terrorism belongs in the category of the most serious crimes, and has the potential to affect all the countries in the world. We would therefore like to suggest the inclusion of such a crime, in a form acceptable to all countries, within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.</div>
	<div class="p">There can be no doubt that the United Nations will have to continue to play a leading role in fighting international terrorism. Scientific and technological advances can clearly become a threat if they get into the hands of terrorists. This prospect creates a climate of fear at the beginning of a century which is expected to bring about the even greater development of technologies. In such a context, the United Nations has to undertake certain measures to ensure that progress in technology is used for the betterment of humanity, not for increasing fear.</div>
	<div class="p">During this General Assembly session we have expressed our full commitment to declaring war on terrorism. We have adopted many resolutions and conventions on this issue. But we are deeply convinced that we should strengthen the follow-up of the implementation of all these United Nations instruments.</div>
	<div class="p">We are therefore proposing that the General Assembly and the Security Council establish one body to be responsible for the follow-up of the implementation of the provisions of those United Nations instruments. That would be the best way to enable the international community to continue to be alert to prevent the spread of such a horrible international evil.</div>

	Mrs. dos Santos Jalo (Guinea-Bissau)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Since this is the first time that I have taken the floor, permit me to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to congratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan upon his re-election to a second term.</div>
	<div class="p">Tuesday, 11 September 2001, is a day of sorrow, not only for the people of the United States of America but also for all of civilized society. Our delegation, the people and the Government of Guinea-Bissau have deep sympathy with the pain inflicted on our host city of New York, and we wish to express our deepest condolences to the Government and people of the United States of America and to all other countries who lost their nationals in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania.</div>
	<div class="p">Although this barbaric act of terrorism happened on American soil, it touched us all in one way or another. It took away the freedom and peace of mind we enjoyed in believing that we lived in a global and civilized world. Our children, for whom we were preparing to work during the twenty-seventh special session of the General Assembly, deserve a civilized global world -- a world of peace and security where they can fly in aeroplanes without fear, walk to their schools breathing safe air without masks, drink the water of their lands without any suspicion of inhaling poison. If we do not clean up the earth for our children, there will be no future for humankind. We should stand together and fight terrorism in order to bring freedom and peace for our children of tomorrow.</div>
	<div class="p">These criminal evil minds have no hearts, no human purpose in their lives and, even less, no faith in God. There is no religion that teaches the killing of another human being. These godless people have a simple name -- terrorists -- whose own lives are worthless.</div>
	<div class="p">On 11 September, the people of our host city of New York presented us with a lesson. In the shadow of their pain, they stood together without intimidation. The terrorists should not win our hearts. They should not intimidate the community of nations continuing the fight that led to the creation of this Organization. It is a fight for a world of peace and security in order to bring sustainable development to all humanity so that our children can enjoy a peaceful tomorrow free of violence and fear.</div>
	<div class="p">The fight against international terrorism seems to be a complicated task. The attacks on 11 September have made it evident that no country and no place is immune from terrorism. Therefore, the international community should strengthen its efforts to solve regional conflicts as one of the methods of combating terrorism. The United Nations, which plays a key role in the system of suppressing terrorism, already has reacted through Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">resolution 1368 (2001)</a> and General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1.pdf">resolution 56/1</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Our common village, the world, is preparing for the International Conference on Financing for Development. To achieve the goals of this Conference, we need peace and security. There can be no development without peace, especially in today's globalized world. Those responsible for these horrific crimes against innocent lives should be brought to justice. International law under the United Nations Charter should be our guide so that all nations can enjoy peace and work towards sustainable development.</div>
	<div class="p">My Government believes in dialogue as a way to solve this problem. Therefore, we are strongly supportive of efforts to find better and efficient alternatives to combat terrorism and all of its root causes. Guinea-Bissau is committed to working towards the implementation of existing international anti-terrorism conventions and all new conventions, propositions and measures that can help in the fight against terrorism.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Stanislaus" nation="Grenada" language="">
	Mr. Stanislaus (Grenada)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The delegation of Grenada aligns itself with the statement presented by the representative of Dominica on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).</div>
	<div class="p">As the marathon debate on this agenda item, "Measures to eliminate international terrorism", winds down, everything that should be said has already been said, but not everyone has said so. Therefore, for the record, Grenada, whether by accident or by design, claims its place among the last speakers.</div>
	<div class="p">It was the immortal William Shakespeare who wrote centuries ago:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head". (<i>"As You Like It", Act II, scene one</i>)</div>
	<div class="p">The dastardly, criminal and horrific terrorist act perpetrated on the United States of America -- indeed, upon the civilized world -- on 11 September, galvanized the solidarity of the international community in its condemnation and its resolve, especially the people of the United States of America and New Yorkers, who have found strength and unity in adversity.</div>
	<div class="p">The Prime Minister of Grenada, the Honourable Keith Mitchell, has already extended his profound personal sympathy and that of the Government and people of Grenada to the President of the United States of America and to the relatives of the many victims who lost their lives and those who have been maimed or injured by this senseless and barbaric act.</div>
	<div class="p">Grenada, too, lost nationals in those terrorist attacks and, therefore, feels the pain of the thousands of people of other countries who have lost their loved ones, loved ones whom we loved so much.</div>
	<div class="p">When hatred and violence determine the actions of individuals, the result can only be extreme behaviour that causes the wanton and callous destruction of life and property. The view that hatred is bred by feelings of dispossession, imbalance and inequality cannot be ignored, and we must consider taking steps to reduce the economic and social imbalances that exist in our world community. This would no doubt assist in our fight against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Grenada recalls Article 1 of the Charter and calls on this body to take every step necessary to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p">We wish to reiterate the purpose of the Organization, which calls for</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace".</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Grenada pledges its full support for actions to eliminate the scourge of terrorism. We must ensure that acts of terrorism do not become a facet of human existence.</div>
	<div class="p">My country fully supports and endorses Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which sets out important measures that countries -- big and small, rich and poor -- must all now take together to prevent and combat terrorists in our jurisdictions, or wherever they may be found, in all their forms and manifestations.</div>
	<div class="p">Grenada has already begun to take steps within its jurisdiction and within its capacity to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorists. Our priority will be to aim at, first, seeking to prevent those who finance, plan, facilitate or commit terrorist acts from using Grenada for those purposes against other States or other citizens, and, secondly, finding ways of intensifying and accelerating the exchange and sharing of information. Grenada is examining its administrative and other processes with a view to improving efficiency in this regard. But our activities will not be limited.</div>
	<div class="p">My country will intensify the degree of regional and international cooperation, as we seek to ensure that there are no gaps in the global framework and in the fight against this heinous crime. Grenada will reinforce and extend its international cooperation arrangements in the field of justice, policing and law enforcement.</div>
	<div class="p">My Government fully supports the development of a comprehensive and effective legal framework to combat terrorism. My country has begun a review of international conventions already in place, with a view to signing, ratifying and fully implementing them. Those not yet in effect would be implemented. Some of these conventions are within the United Nations system, while others are of a regional or hemispheric nature.</div>
	<div class="p">Priority is being given to the existing 12 United Nations and international conventions against terrorism, in particular the United Nations Convention on terrorist financing.</div>
	<div class="p">It is necessary for the international community to send a clear signal to the terrorists that their philosophy is fundamentally wrong and totally unacceptable. We must stand united in our efforts to combat and eliminate activities aimed at killing innocent people and destroying communities.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Grenada joins the Caribbean Community in pledging our full support in the efforts to confront terrorist activities and restore the rights and freedoms of people all over the world.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, Grenada has had an opportunity in another forum to greet, salute and congratulate the President on his conduct of the meetings of the General Assembly thus far. Our confidence in his leadership and skilful handling of them is reinforced.</div>
