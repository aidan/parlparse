</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">I have the honour to present to the General Assembly for its consideration the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, covering its work during 1998, as contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/53/23</a>, parts I-IX.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">The report is being submitted in accordance with paragraph 11 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-78.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 52/78</a>, regarding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The Assembly requested the Special Committee to continue to seek suitable means for the full implementation of the Declaration and, in particular, to formulate specific proposals for the elimination of the remaining manifestations of colonialism. It also called upon the Committee to continue to examine the implementation of the Declaration by Member States, pay special attention to the small Territories, particularly by dispatching regular visiting missions, to enable them to exercise their right to self-determination and independence, and to enlist worldwide support for the achievement of the objectives of the Declaration. Furthermore, in keeping with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 46/181</a>, entitled "International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism", the Special Committee was also mandated to undertake a series of activities, including organizing seminars in the Caribbean and the Pacific regions, alternately, during the Decade.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">During the last year, the Special Committee held extensive consultations, keeping in mind the particular and specific requests of the General Assembly just outlined. The Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration with a view to formulating a series of recommendations to enhance the pace of decolonization and promote political, economic, social and educational advancement of the peoples in the remaining Territories. To do so, it acceded to the requests of Spain to participate in its proceedings on the question of Gibraltar, of Brazil and Sao Tome and Principe in the consideration of the question of East Timor, and of the delegations of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay in the proceedings on the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas).</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">With regard to the question of the list of Territories to which the Declaration is applicable, the Committee decided to continue to review this issue at its next session, subject to any directives given by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">Having resolved to rationalize the organization of its work, the Committee kept its formal meetings to a minimum. The members held 17 meetings between February and May and also convened a session from 29 June to 13 July. It maintained the arrangement by which its Subcommittee and its Working Group were replaced by an Open-ended Bureau. In the time-frame agreed to, the Special Committee discharged the responsibilities assigned by the Assembly and submitted its recommendations on all items entrusted to it, which are contained in parts II-IX of the report before the General Assembly contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/53/23</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa06">In particular, I would like to draw the Assembly's attention to <a href="../pdf/A-53-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/53/23</a>, part II, paragraph 12, which contains the draft resolution on the dissemination of information on decolonization, adopted by the Special Committee and recommended to the General Assembly for adoption. The Special Committee also considered carrying out a critical review of its work and may wish to convene a meeting in the near future to do so. The Acting Chairman presented a paper, which is annexed to the report of the Special Committee (<a href="../pdf/A-AC.109-L.1886.pdf" class="nolink">A/AC.109/L.1886</a>), to facilitate the consultations on the intended approach for such an assessment.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa07">By adopting the suggestions put forward by the Chairman relating to the organization of its work, the Special Committee decided to take up as appropriate an item entitled "Special Committee decision of 15 August 1991 concerning Puerto Rico", and to consider that issue in its plenary. A number of recommendations were received from organizations that expressed their wish to be heard by the Special Committee on this subject. This request was acceded to by the Committee, and on 10 and 11 August 1998, the Committee heard representatives of 29 organizations, as detailed in the report presented to the Assembly. Following the consideration of this item, the Committee adopted a draft resolution, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-AC.109-2131.pdf" class="nolink">A/AC.109/2131</a>, which, <i>inter alia</i>, reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence, and expresses the hope that the Government of the United States will assume its responsibility of expediting this process. It also requests the Rapporteur to present a report to the Special Committee next year on the implementation of this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa08">The Special Committee also decided to consider an item entitled "Matters relating to the small Territories" and took into account the provisions of relevant resolutions -- including <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-78.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 52/78</a>, paragraph 11 (c), which requests the Special Committee to pay special attention to the small Territories, in particular through the dispatch of regular visiting missions. During the period under review, this question was given extensive consideration, as noted in chapters X to XII of the present report.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa09">In regard to its programme of work for 1999, the Special Committee considered the question of holding a series of meetings away from Headquarters, as authorized by the General Assembly. It decided that it would consider accepting invitations as might be received in 1999, and thereafter, request the Secretary-General to seek the necessary budgetary provision in accordance with established procedure. Following the guidelines on the pattern of conferences, in particular <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-214.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 52/214</a> of 22 December 1997, and taking into account its probable workload for 1999, the Special Committee decided to strive to fulfil its mandate by keeping its meetings to a minimum. This would entail holding its plenary meetings in February/March 1999 and up to 30 meetings in June/July. The Bureau expects to hold some 20 meetings between February and July 1999. This would not preclude any ad hoc meetings that may be warranted and is subject to any directives given by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa10">I draw the Assembly's attention to the question of cooperation and participation of the administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee. I would like to report that the delegations of New Zealand and Portugal continued to participate in the related aspect of the Committee's work and that the delegation of France participated in the consideration of the question of New Caledonia. Though the delegations of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America, did not participate in the work of the Committee, as a result of informal consultations held during the fifty-first session of the General Assembly and the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-224.pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 51/224</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-77.pdf" class="pdf">52/77</a> on small Territories, both administering Powers expressed their desire to continue an informal dialogue with the Special Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa11">The Special Committee continues to call upon the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to cooperate with the United Nations by receiving visiting missions in the Territories under their administration. The Special Committee recommends that the General Assembly again request the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to cooperate with the Special Committee in the discharge of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa12">The Special Committee has also decided that the participation of representatives of Non-Self-Governing Territories in its work should continue. Further, it recommends to the General Assembly that the Committee should continue to be represented at seminars, meetings and conferences organized by United Nations bodies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations active in the field of decolonization.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa13">During the year, the Chairman of the Special Committee held consultations with the President of the Economic and Social Council to consider appropriate measures for coordinating policies and activities of the specialized agencies in implementing the relevant resolutions; this is accounted for in chapter VII of the present report. In its consideration of the Territories concerned, the Special Committee took into account the relevant resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, including resolutions on the question of Western Sahara and the situation in East Timor. It also continued to follow the work of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and to monitor related developments in the Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa14">The Committee maintained contact with the Organization of African Unity and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) during the year, and it continues to follow the work of the South Pacific Forum and the activities of non-governmental organizations which have a special interest in decolonization. The Acting Chairman represented the Special Committee at the Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in May as well as the Ministerial Meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Durban in August.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa15">The Special Committee held a regional seminar at Nadi, Fiji, in June 1998 in implementation of the Plan of Action for the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. The outcome is presented in chapter II of the report. The question-and-answer session promoted at that meeting was particularly useful in promoting an open and frank discussion of issues. The Committee has also adopted a resolution which makes recommendations to the General Assembly on the question of the publicity to be given to the work of the United Nations in the field of decolonization, outlined in chapter III of this report.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa16">In accordance with its mandate, the Special Committee intends to continue to pursue the speedy and unconditional end of colonialism in all its forms during 1999. It will endeavour to examine its own work critically and assess the effectiveness of its activities and the areas in which it can improve. In particular, it is gratified that the informal consultations held with the administering Powers -- the United Kingdom and the United States -- and the European Union, concluded in an agreement on the consolidated draft resolution on small Territories and the draft resolution on economic and other activities which affect the peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories, respectively. The Assembly may wish to renew its appeal to all States, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to comply with the various requests addressed to them by the General Assembly and the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa17">The Special Committee has approved a tentative programme of meetings for 1999 and commends it to the Assembly for approval. It also suggests that the Assembly would examine the question of the implementation of the Declaration by taking into account the various recommendations reflected in the present report and would endorse the proposals outlined in order to enable the Special Committee to carry out the tasks it envisages for 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa18">As the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism approaches its last two years, much has been achieved, but much remains to be done. The Special Committee will make a renewed and concerted effort to meet its goals by working closely with the Territories, the administering Powers, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, the non-governmental organizations and the wider international community.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa19">We call upon each of them to cooperate fully with the Special Committee to formulate concrete mechanisms, appropriate procedures and legislation to complete the processes required for the implementation of the Declaration by the populations of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories by the end of this decade and achieve our ultimate goal of ushering in, in the twenty-first century, a world free from colonialism.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa20">Before concluding, allow me to express to all the members of the Special Committee and in particular Acting Chairman Ambassador Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla of Cuba, as well as Vice-Chairman Ambassador Moctar Ouane of Mali, my appreciation for their assistance, support and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa21">Finally, may I extend the Committee's appreciation and gratitude also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for giving priority to and establishing a stand-alone Decolonization Unit in the Department of Political Affairs and giving it substantive responsibilities for the programme on decolonization. I also thank Ms. Maria Maldonado, Chief of the Decolonization Unit, as well as Mr. Mohammad Sattar, Secretary of the Special Committee, along with their respective substantive and technical secretariats, in both the departments of Political Affairs and General Assembly Affairs, for their professional advice and assistance in facilitating my task as Rapporteur.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa22">On behalf of the Committee, I commend the report to the attention of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01"> I now call on the representative of Cuba to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-53-L.58.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/53/L.58</a>.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly as it begins its consideration of the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. In my capacity as Acting Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples during the current year, I have been privileged to serve the Special Committee and conduct its deliberations, the results of which are duly reflected in the report contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-23.pdf" class="nolink">document A/53/23</a>, parts I-IX.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The General Assembly has just heard a statement by the Rapporteur of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, introducing the report of the Special Committee. In its report, the Special Committee has made a number of recommendations to the Assembly for its consideration and action. These recommendations represent the considered contribution of the Committee to the efforts of the United Nations to eradicate the last remnants of colonialism from the face of the earth.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Today I am speaking, on behalf of the sponsors, to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-53-L.58.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/53/L.58</a> for consideration by the General Assembly. This draft resolution addresses the issue of the implementation of the Declaration adopted by the Assembly 38 years ago and refers specifically to the responsibility entrusted by the Assembly to the Special Committee for monitoring the fulfilment of the letter and the spirit of the Declaration by the parties concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">When the Special Committee was established by General Assembly resolution 1654 (XVI), the Assembly requested it to examine the application of the Declaration, to make suggestions and recommendations on the progress and extent of the implementation and to report thereon to the Assembly. The Assembly also directed the Special Committee to carry out its task by using all the means at its disposal within the framework of the procedures and modalities that it adopted for the proper discharge of its functions. The Assembly invited the authorities concerned to afford the Special Committee their fullest cooperation in carrying out its tasks and requested the specialized agencies concerned to assist the Special Committee in its work within their respective fields.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Thirty-eight years later, the Special Committee continues to carry out conscientiously the mandate it received from the Assembly in 1961. Despite the significant progress achieved, the decolonization process has not been concluded.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">By the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would recall and reaffirm previous resolutions on decolonization, including <a href="../pdf/A-RES-43-47.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 43/47</a>, which declared the decade that began in 1990 as the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that have not yet exercised their right to self-determination, including independence. The Assembly would also reaffirm its determination to continue to take all steps necessary to bring about the complete, speedy and unconditional eradication of colonialism and the faithful observance by all States of the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">By adopting this draft resolution, the Assembly would approve the report of the Special Committee covering its work during 1998 and the programme of work envisaged for 1999. In this connection, the Special Committee would continue to seek suitable means of ensuring the immediate and full implementation of the Declaration and also carry out actions approved by the Assembly in connection with the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. The Special Committee would continue to formulate proposals for the elimination of the remaining manifestations of colonialism and would report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The Special Committee has indicated that it will endeavour to look at its own work critically, carrying out an assessment of the effectiveness of its activities and the areas in which it can make improvements. Such a review is made all the more necessary as we approach the end of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. The commitment of the Special Committee and the United Nations to fulfilling the aims of the Decade so as to achieve a world free of colonial domination must be expressed in concrete, purposeful efforts. The principles of the Charter regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories are as relevant today as they were at the inception of the United Nations, and great strides have already been made in the implementation of the 1960 Declaration. Nevertheless, more can be done in the future to accelerate the process of decolonization. The goals of the 1960 Declaration are achievable, and they require the cooperation of the administering Powers with the Special Committee. We hope that in 1999 such cooperation will take us a long way towards achieving those goals.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">By the terms of the draft resolution, the Special Committee would also continue to pay special attention to the small Territories, in particular by dispatching visiting missions to secure first-hand information and to ascertain the wishes and aspirations of these Territories' inhabitants. It would also take steps to enlist worldwide support from Governments and from national and international organizations for the achievement of the objectives of the 1960 Declaration and other relevant resolutions of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">By the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would call upon the administering Powers to continue to cooperate with the Special Committee in the discharge of its mandate and continue to receive visiting missions to the Territories. The Assembly would also call upon the administering Powers that have not participated in the work of the Special Committee to do so at its 1999 session. I should like to point out that during 1998 New Zealand and Portugal continued their cooperation with the Special Committee. Furthermore, for the first time, France attended meetings of the Special Committee and provided valuable information regarding the historic signing of the Nouméa Accord and its implications for New Caledonia. As Acting Chairman of the Special Committee, I carried out consultations with the administering Powers regarding sending future visiting missions to the Territories, and I remain hopeful that our future dialogue with the administering Powers will include an agreement on this point.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">On many occasions the Special Committee has expressed its readiness to engage in constructive dialogue with the administering Powers, as it considers that their cooperation is indispensable for progress towards the full implementation of the 1960 Declaration. During 1998 members of the Special Committee had the opportunity to hold informal consultations that proved useful in reaching significant agreed recommendations that were submitted to the General Assembly, including recommendations regarding New Caledonia, Tokelau and Guam.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-53-L.58.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/L.58</a> also requests the Secretary-General, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to provide economic, social and other assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories. Such assistance is necessary above all for the small island Territories, which are affected by their small size, small populations, geographic remoteness, limited natural resources and vulnerability to natural disasters.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">Lastly, the draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to provide the Special Committee with the facilities and services required to carry out its mandate in implementing the resolutions and decisions on decolonization adopted by the General Assembly and the Special Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">The States members of the European Union have informally presented to the sponsors various amendments to <a href="../pdf/A-53-L.58.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/53/L.58</a>, and although we have begun consultations in that regard, the lack of adequate time made it impossible to consider those amendments in depth. Given the scope of the amendments for a text that has existed for more than five years, some of which have direct implications for the programme of work of the Special Committee of 24, the recommendations would have to be duly discussed within the Special Committee itself in order for it to take the appropriate decisions.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa15">The draft resolution that we are presenting this year is therefore substantively similar to the texts that the General Assembly has adopted by broad majority over the last few years.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa16">The sponsoring delegations welcome the European Union's initiative with a view to moving towards greater concertation on these issues, and we hope that this will mark the beginning of a constructive and transparent process in that direction. The General Assembly can rely on the greatest possible willingness and constructive spirit on the part of the Special Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa17">I would like to point out that during 1998 the Special Committee received appropriate substantive and technical support from the Secretariat and has had at its disposal adequate resources to carry out its activities. In this respect, I would like to express to the Secretary-General, on behalf of the Special Committee, our appreciation and our satisfaction with the arrangements made to assist the Special Committee in the fulfilment of its mandate. In order for the Special Committee to continue to work smoothly, it is essential for such services and facilities to continue to be provided.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa18">In conclusion, I would like to ask all Member States to consider positively the recommendations contained in the draft resolution before them on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. This would be an expression of support for the principled efforts of the United Nations to put an effective, speedy and unconditional end to colonialism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ayewoh</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The consideration by the General Assembly at its fifty-third session of agenda item 18, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", could not have come at a better time. The historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which was adopted in 1960, has tremendously changed the membership and composition of the United Nations, as well as the conduct of relations among States.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">My delegation attaches great importance to this agenda item, partly out of its historical experience as a former colonial territory and also out of a principled position regarding the rights of peoples to control their own destiny. My delegation commends the Committee of 24. Its success in the task assigned to it is universally recognized and appreciated by all.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">Despite this success, however, we still have many Non-Self-Governing Territories today under one form of colonial administration or another. Indeed, precisely because of the nature of most of these Territories, which are basically small in size and population, as well as less endowed with natural resources, the role of the United Nations in ensuring that they attain their independence by the end of this decade has become more critical.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">My delegation believes that these factors notwithstanding, it is only fair and just that the administering Powers give the indigenous peoples of these Territories the opportunity to decide whether or not they wish to be independent. This should be done under internationally recognized due process with the close supervision of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">The declaration of this decade as the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism underscores the fervent desire of the General Assembly to put the issue of colonialism behind it within a reasonable time-frame.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">In this regard, my delegation wishes to reiterate its support for the work of the Special Committee on Decolonization. We will continue to cooperate with it in its endeavour to implement its objective of bringing an end to the era of colonialism by the year 2000. We welcome the measures adopted for the dissemination of information on decolonization in the Non-Self-Governing Territories and commend the efforts of the United Nations in the coordination of development assistance to these Territories by the specialized agencies. We deplore the activities of some foreign economic and other interests which are impeding the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence in these Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Experience has taught all of us, especially those of us from formerly colonized countries, that for decolonization and self-government to be of any value to colonial peoples, it must be pursued simultaneously with concrete social, economic and political development measures. Assistance should be given to the colonial Territories to help establish the sound economic foundations and good political education necessary to carry the responsibilities of self-government. The United Nations specialized agencies should therefore increase development assistance programmes to these Territories, especially in human resource development.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">As we approach the new millennium, let all the peoples of the world rededicate themselves to the complete eradication of colonialism. The Nigeria delegation has worked and will continue to work with the United Nations and its agencies to ensure the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-181.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 46/181</a> on the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. We will continue to cooperate closely with other delegations to ensure the attainment of this noble goal.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ovia</span> <span class="nation">Papua New Guinea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to make some general comments regarding all the items before the General Assembly for consideration today, and especially those under the mandate of the Special Political Committee on Decolonization, the Committee of 24.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Papua New Guinea's position and views regarding all these issues are well known to the members of the General Assembly and therefore I do not intend to repeat them again at this time.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">I would, however, like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to and congratulate the Chairman of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (the Fourth Committee), Mr. Pablo Macedo, and his Bureau for the exceptional efforts they have made in completing the work of that Committee in record time. I stand to be corrected here, but to the best of my knowledge, this year is the one of the few times, if not the first -- at least in the short time I have been at the United Nations -- in which that Committee has completed its work expeditiously.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">I must also pay tribute to the diplomatic skills and leadership of Mr. Opertti in ensuring that the work of the Committee was on schedule. I am now thinking aloud here in wondering whether the fact that he and Mr. Macedo come from the same region of the world has anything to do with this speed. May I also add here that the Acting Chairman of the Committee of 24, Ambassador Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, also comes from that region.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Secondly, I would like to also take the opportunity to thank all the members of the Fourth Committee for their efforts and cooperation in working through the issues of mutual interest to all our countries. In this regard, I would like to make special mention of the good cooperation shown by all the administering Powers, and especially the Governments of New Zealand on Tokelau; the Government of Portugal; the Republic of France on New Caledonia; and, although informally, the Government of the United States on the question Guam; as well as the Acting Chairman and members of the Special Political Committee for all their efforts. My delegation would like place on record our great appreciation and further express the hope that we will continue to work together in the same spirit in the future towards a positive and eventual resolution of the status of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, of course taking into full account and consideration the expressed and legitimate will of the peoples of the Territories concern.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">As is clearly shown by all the draft resolutions to be adopted by consensus today, including the omnibus draft resolution before the Committee today, my delegation is of the view that we, the Members of the United Nations, the administering Powers and members of the Committee of 24 alike, must allow and include in any negotiations and dialogue on the future of those Territories the affected peoples concerned. We will make much progress towards ending the last vestiges of colonialism, as clearly demonstrated by some of the consensus draft resolutions before us today, if we continue in this trend. Alternatively, as many of us would agree today, our Organization must allow for the greater engagement of the peoples of these Territories by sending periodic, if not regular United Nations visiting missions to each of these Territories to ascertain the full wishes of the peoples concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Also in the same vein, my delegation would like to pay high tribute to the Secretary-General and his Special Rapporteurs for their positive efforts with regards to a number of the Non-Self-Governing Territories under their focus. From our delegation's assessment, there is good and positive progress being made on these fronts as well.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">I am sure this is our common objective and the ultimate goal of our Organization and we must all persevere with those final efforts, which sometimes are the most difficult, to bring to fruition our desired goals.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">May I also add here that, as "reform" is the buzz word in the corridors of this Assembly, it makes good economic, if not common sense for us to work together in resolving the outstanding issues in the shortest possible time in order that we may save money and time for our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, my delegation pays tribute to all the members of this Assembly and makes a further call on all interested parties to devote those last efforts, including the political will to cooperate fully with the Committee of 24 and the General Assembly, to achieving our mandated objectives.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa01">At its fifty-third session, the General Assembly, upon recommendation of the General Committee, allocated to the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) for consideration 12 agenda items: items 18, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and 12 and 90.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa02">At its meeting on organization of work, held on 17 September 1998, the Fourth Committee decided, in order to rationalize its work and to make full and effective use of the conference services and facilities, to have a single general debate on all agenda items relating to the question of Non-Self-Governing Territories and other related matters. It spared no effort to complete its work by Friday, 20 November, as requested by the General Assembly. Between 5 October and 19 November, it held 24 meetings and adopted a total of 25 draft resolutions and three draft decisions, and concluded its work on Thursday, 19 November 1998, one day before the deadline set by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa03">It is my great pleasure and honour to introduce the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee to the General Assembly for consideration and approval.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa04">The first report, submitted under agenda item 18, entitled "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-594.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/594</a>. The Committee adopted five draft resolutions, including a consolidated draft resolution dealing with 11 separate Territories. These draft resolutions appear in paragraph 34 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends them to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa05">I should like to inform the General Assembly that paragraph 32 of the report contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-594.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/594</a> does not match the original text submitted for publication. I therefore wish to read out the text of that paragraph as adopted by the Fourth Committee. The new text reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa06">"At the same meeting, on the proposal of the Chairman, the Committee decided to recommend to the General Assembly the adoption of a consolidated draft resolution incorporating the draft resolution on Guam which had been adopted (see para. 31), as section VI of the draft resolutions on the questions of American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, Pitcairn, St. Helena, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands, adopted on 13 October (see para. 26), with the following changes (see para. 34, draft resolution IV):".</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa07">Of course, a corrigendum on the new paragraph will be issued by the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa08">The second report, on agenda item 81, entitled "Effects of atomic radiation", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-595.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/595</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (<a href="../pdf/A-53-46.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/46</a>), as well as the reports submitted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (<a href="../pdf/A-53-478.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/478</a>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (<a href="../pdf/A-53-483.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/483</a>) on this question and adopted a draft resolution on this subject without a vote. The draft resolution appears in paragraph 6 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa09">The third report, issued as <a href="../pdf/A-53-596.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/596</a>, relates to agenda item 82, entitled "International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space". The Committee adopted without a vote the draft resolution that appears in paragraph 10 of the report and recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa10">The fourth report, issued as <a href="../pdf/A-53-597.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/597</a>, relates to item 83 of the agenda, entitled "United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East". The Committee adopted seven draft resolutions on this item relating to various aspects of the mandate of the Agency, appear in paragraph 22 of the report, and recommends them to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa11">The fifth report, relating to agenda item 84, entitled "Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-598.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/598</a>. The Committee adopted five draft resolutions, which appear in paragraph 21 of the report. It recommends the five draft resolutions to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa12">I wish to emphasize here that, generally speaking, the Fourth Committee welcomed, when it was considering this item, the signing of the Wye River Memorandum on 23 October 1998 between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority and expressed the wish that a final and lasting peace would be achieved for the mutual benefit of the two parties.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa13">The sixth report, on agenda item 85, entitled "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-599.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/599</a>. The Fourth Committee adopted a draft resolution under this agenda item, which appears in paragraph 8 of its report, and recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa14">The seventh report, submitted under agenda item 86, entitled "Questions relating to information", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-600.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/600</a>. The Committee adopted without a vote draft resolutions A and B, which appear in paragraph 8, as well as the draft decision in paragraph 9. It recommends the two draft resolutions and the draft decision to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa15">The eighth report, issued as <a href="../pdf/A-53-601.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/601</a>, relates to agenda item 87, entitled "Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 <i>e </i>of the Charter of the United Nations". The draft resolution on this item appears in paragraph 7 of the report, and the Fourth Committee recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa16">The ninth report, issued as <a href="../pdf/A-53-602.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/602</a>, relates to agenda items 88, entitled "Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories", and 18, entitled "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples". By a recorded vote of 120 votes in favour to 2 against, with 3 abstentions, the Committee adopted a draft resolution on agenda item 88 entitled "Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories". The Committee also adopted a draft decision entitled "Military activities and arrangements by colonial Powers in Territories under their administration" by a recorded vote of 74 votes in favour to 44 against, with 2 abstentions. The Fourth Committee recommends to the General Assembly for adoption the draft resolution and the draft decision, which appear in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the report respectively.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa17">The tenth report, issued as <a href="../pdf/A-53-603.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/603</a>, relates to agenda items 89, entitled "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations", and 12, entitled "Report of the Economic and Social Council". The Committee adopted a draft resolution on agenda item 89 by a recorded vote of 85 votes in favour to none against, with 41 abstentions. It recommends that draft resolution, which appears in paragraph 7 of its report, for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa18">The eleventh and final report relates to agenda item 90, "Offers by Member States of study and training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories", and is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-604.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/604</a>. The Committee recommends the draft resolution appearing in paragraph 6 of that report for adoption by the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa19">On behalf of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), I commend to the General Assembly for consideration and approval all the reports I have just introduced.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa20">Let me take this opportunity to thank and pay special tribute to all delegations and all others who have contributed to the success of the work of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) at this session. I congratulate all the members of the Committee on the skill and spirit of cooperation they demonstrated with a view to achieving mutually satisfactory solutions, enabling the Committee to complete its work in an effective and constructive manner.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa21">In particular, I thank the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Pablo Macedo of Mexico, whose diplomatic skill and experience enabled the Committee to conclude, on time and in an extremely effective way, its work on the agenda items allocated to it by the General Assembly. The Chairman benefitted from the valuable support of the Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Ferden Çariçhi of Turkey, Mr. Chun Hae-Jin of the Republic of Korea and Mr. Tomás Hrbác of Slovakia, with whom as Rapporteur I had the pleasure of working as part of the Bureau of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa22">I want also to thank Mr. Mohammad Sattar, the Secretary of the Committee. It was truly a pleasure to work with him and his dynamic, supportive, capable team; thanks to them, the Committee's work was carried out in a climate of genuine cordiality.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa23">My thanks go also to the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, Mr. Jin Yongjian, for his kind assistance to the Committee, and to Mr. Vadim Perfiliev, Director of the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs Division, for his help and cooperation.</p>

	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01"> I now call on the representative of the United Kingdom, who wishes to speak in explanation of vote after the voting. May I remind him that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Eldon</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I regret that my delegation has found it again necessary to vote against <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-68.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 53/68</a>, on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-69.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 53/69</a>, on the dissemination of information on decolonization.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">The latter text does contain elements which, as an administering Power, the United Kingdom welcomes. In particular, we note the recognition that self-determination does not automatically equate independence and that there are other options available. However, we believe that the continuing financial crisis means that the obligation this text places on the Department of Political Affairs and Department of Public Information to publicize decolonization issues is a serious waste of scarce resources. This resolution is therefore unacceptable to us.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">The United Kingdom also regrets that the resolution on the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples continues to contain outdated language and assumptions that do not reflect reality in the United Kingdom's Non-Self-Governing Territories. We do not accept that the presence of military bases could in any way constitute an obstacle to the granting of independence or impede their inhabitants from expressing their views on self-determination. Similarly, the text of the resolution suggests the administering Powers are guilty of "economic exploitation" and even of "violations of basic human rights". We reject such claims, which are wholly without foundation.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">My delegation also finds unacceptable the continued references to "colonialism", "colonial rule" and "colonial countries". We do not accept that such terminology accurately reflects the present-day relationship between the United Kingdom and its overseas Territories. And the presence of such language in this text is particularly regrettable, given the improvements made to other resolutions on decolonization issues in recent years. We hope that the drafters of the two resolutions before us will in future follow the trend set in these other resolutions. We stand ready to work with them to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">My delegation joins with others in recognizing that decolonization is one of the great success stories of the United Nations. We pay tribute to those who have worked successfully and with goodwill in this field, and we will of course continue to fulfil our Charter obligations with regard to the United Kingdom's overseas Territories.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">We also welcome the Special Committee of 24's readiness to engage constructively with the administering Powers. However, the United Kingdom continues to take issue with the need for a decolonization programme of the kind espoused by the Committee. The United Nations has more pressing goals, affecting vastly greater numbers of the world's population and more relevant to today's needs. The activities and structure of this Organization should reflect the world's present and future priorities, not those of the past.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">In conclusion, the two draft resolutions submitted to this General Assembly do not reflect or advance the wishes and interests of the peoples of the remaining United Kingdom overseas Territories; and those wishes and interests remain the paramount consideration in my Government's policy towards them.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa03">The opening of the commemoration and the award of human rights prizes will be held in the General Assembly Hall at 10 a.m. For logistical reasons, the commemoration will continue that same morning and for the rest of the day in Conference Room 4, where all statements by member States and observers will be heard.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa04">In this connection, members will recall that yesterday, at its 76th plenary meeting, the General Assembly decided to limit statements in the commemoration to five minutes in view of the very large number of speakers already inscribed.</p>
