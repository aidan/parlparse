	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa01">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.61.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/L.61</a>, submitted by the President of the General Assembly, is the outcome of consultations among Member States, which at the request of the President I conducted as facilitator. The draft resolution is intended to lay the organizational basis and set out the modalities for June's High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa02">I would recall that, as reaffirmed in the draft resolution, the High-level Dialogue is the intergovernmental focal point for the general follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development. Ensuring its success is thus vitally important for progress on the meeting the commitments adopted at Monterrey. We feel that the draft resolution provides a solid basis to enable the international community, at the June event, to make solid progress on the issue of financing for development. We are certain that the modalities set out in the text will enable the June High-level Dialogue to make an important contribution to the negotiating process for the September high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly, as the Assembly requested.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa03">As facilitator, I wish to thank and pay tribute to all delegations for their work and for the positive and constructive attitude they demonstrated throughout the consultations, which I think is a sign that we will be able to achieve excellent results at the June event.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa04">Let me conclude by mentioning the support we have received from the Secretariat and from the Office of the President of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01"> With regard to draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.61.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/L.61</a>, I should like to inform members that by operative paragraph 4 the General Assembly would</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">"[decide] also that the High-level Dialogue will consist of a series of formal and informal meetings to constitute a policy dialogue and six interactive multi-stakeholder round tables".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">By operative paragraph 12, the Assembly would</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">"[request] the Secretary-General to seek from the regional commissions their inputs on the regional and interregional aspects of the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development and to report thereon to the High-level Dialogue".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">The Secretariat would like to inform the General Assembly that no additional conference service requirements would arise under the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, as the requirements of operative paragraph 4 have already been included in the calendar of conferences for 2005, based on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-250.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 57/250</a>. In that resolution, the General Assembly decided to hold the High-level Dialogue biennally at the ministerial level. It was specified that the duration of the High-level Dialogue would be two days, and that it would consist of an innovative series of plenary and informal meetings to constitute a policy dialogue and eight interactive round tables with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa06">As concerns non-conferencing costs related to the provision of operative paragraph 12, requesting inputs from the regional commissions, the requirements for the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development have already been included in the programmes of work of the Commissions in the current biennium.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa07">Therefore, should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.61.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/L.61</a>, no additional requirements would arise under the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005.</p>
