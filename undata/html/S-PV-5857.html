<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Spatafora</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">I wish to briefly take the floor in order to thank all delegations for their very constructive, flexible and strong support during the consultations on this resolution, as well as to express our full satisfaction with the outcome. Once again, the Council is rallying strongly and united behind one of the most important missions of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">We are convinced that this text meets all the expectations expressed in the report (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-159.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/159</a>) of the Secretary-General and in the briefing by Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno on 12 March. The Secretary-General recommended that the Mission's mandate be sharpened. Indeed, the resolution was conceived and discussed in that spirit. In fact, not only are we extending the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) for a further 12 months, we are also offering the Mission clear guidance on the priorities to take forward within the mandate in the coming months: enhanced coordination of, and leadership on, international efforts; strengthened cooperation with the International Security Assistance Force; political outreach; national reconciliation; governance; humanitarian assistance; the promotion of human rights; elections; and regional cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">The resolution also highlights what we have perceived as the main feature of the 12 March debate: the need for all the activities of the Mission and of the international community at large to be guided by the overarching principle of reinforcing Afghan ownership and leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">Finally, we are pleased with the focus of the United Nations on some crucial horizontal issues, namely, the protection of civilians, children and armed conflict, women and peace and security. It is now the duty of the entire international community to translate the resolution into concrete support for UNAMA, in particular for the efforts of the newly appointed Special Representative of the Secretary-General. I am confident that he will receive from all Member States and from the Headquarters of the United Nations the necessary resources and political support to fulfil his daunting task.</p>
