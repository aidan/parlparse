	<p id="docA51PV106-pg001-bk03-pa01">Members will recall that, at its 102nd plenary meeting, on 17 June 1997, the General Assembly decided to include this item on the agenda of the current session as agenda item 168 and that, at its 104th plenary meeting, on 16 July 1997, the Assembly considered the agenda item.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV106-pg001-bk03-pa02">It is my understanding that it is the wish of members to further consider the question of United Nations reform at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA51PV106-pg001-bk03-pa03">May I therefore take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to retain the item on United Nations reform on the agenda of the current session and to include it in the draft agenda of the fifty-second session?</p>
