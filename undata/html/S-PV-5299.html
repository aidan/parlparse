	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now proceed to the election of five members of the International Court of Justice, in accordance with Article 13 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, to fill the five seats which will become vacant on 5 February 2006 on the expiry of the terms of office of the following Judges: Mr. Vladlen S. Vereshchetin (Russian Federation), Mr. Pieter H. Kooijmans (Netherlands), Mr. Francisco Rezek (Brazil), Mr. Thomas Buergenthal (United States of America) and Mr. Nabil Elaraby (Egypt).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The list of candidates nominated by national groups is contained in documents <a href="../pdf/S-2005-447.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/447</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-2005-447-Add.1.pdf" class="nolink">S/2005/447/Add.1</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2005-447-Corr.1.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/447/Corr.1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I should like to inform the members of the Council that I have received a letter addressed to me by the Legal Counsel, dated 2 November 2005, in which he informs me, on behalf of the Secretary-General, that after the established deadline for the filing of nominations, namely, 30 June 2005, several national groups submitted nominations to the Secretariat. I should also like to draw members' attention to the fact that all such additional nominations relate to candidates already nominated by other national groups, whose names therefore already appear in <a href="../pdf/S-2005-447.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/447</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2005-447-Corr.1.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/447/Corr.1</a>. The Legal Counsel recommended that, in accordance with established practice, I inform Council members orally on the day of the election about the decisions of the national groups I have just mentioned. I am also informed that the Legal Counsel made a similar recommendation to the President of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">The nominations made by the national groups to which I have referred are as follows: for Mr. Mohamed Bennouna, Argentina and Jordan; for Mr. Thomas Buergenthal, Germany, New Zealand, Peru and Romania; for Mr. Julio D. González Campos, Argentina; for Mr. Kenneth Keith, Germany, Luxembourg and Papua New Guinea; for Mr. Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor, Argentina, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania; and for Mr. Leonid Skotnikov, Germany and Romania.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">The Security Council has before it a note by the Secretary-General dated 3 November 2005, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2005-447-Add.1.pdf" class="nolink">document S/2005/447/Add.1</a>. Therein, the Secretary-General notes that, by a letter dated 3 November 2005, the representative of Niger informed the Legal Counsel that the national group of Niger had decided to withdraw its nomination of Mr. Seidou Adamou Mazou for election to the International Court of Justice. Since Mr. Mazou was nominated only by the national group of Niger, his name does not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">The Security Council also has before it a memorandum by the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2005-446.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/446</a>, describing the present composition of the Court and setting out the procedure to be followed in the conduct of the election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">I should like to remind the Council that, under Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"Those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of votes in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The required majority in the Security Council is eight votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">If, in the first ballot, the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than five, then, pursuant to rule 61 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Council will proceed to a second ballot on the remaining vacancies. Balloting will then continue in the same manner until five candidates have obtained the required majority of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">If, on the other hand, more than five candidates obtain the required majority, according to past practice and as set forth in paragraph 13 of the Secretary-General's memorandum, a new vote will be held on all the candidates. That rule will also apply to any subsequent ballots if the number of candidates obtaining the absolute majority is greater than the number of vacancies remaining.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The voting will be held by secret ballot. When we proceed to the vote, members of the Council will receive a ballot paper containing the names of all the candidates. In that connection, I should like to offer one slight clarification.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">Members have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2005-447.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/447</a>, which contains a note by the Secretary-General entitled "List of candidates nominated by national groups". I wish to point out to members of the Council that two candidates share the same surname, namely, Mr. Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor, Mexico's candidate, and Mr. Abdelfattah Amor, Tunisia's candidate. In order to avoid any confusion, Mexico's candidate has requested that he appear as Mr. Bernardo Sepúlveda in the ballot to be distributed to members. No such request was made by Tunisia's candidate; his name will therefore appear as Mr. Abdelfattah Amor. I hope that serves to clarify matters.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">No withdrawal will be accepted once ballot papers have been distributed. However, it would be possible to withdraw between ballots. Members of the Council will be requested to place an "X" in the boxes next to the names of the candidates for whom they wish to vote. Only those candidates whose names appear on the ballot paper are eligible for election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">I should like to remind members of paragraph 10 of the Secretary-General's memorandum (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-446.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/446</a>), which specifies that "Each elector may vote for not more than five candidates on the first ballot". Any ballot paper containing votes for more than five names will be considered invalid. When five candidates have obtained the required majority of votes, I shall communicate the result of the election to the President of the General Assembly, and I shall request the Council to remain in session, pending the receipt from the President of the General Assembly of the result of the voting in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">The Council will now proceed to draw lots to select two delegations to serve as tellers. As one of the candidates for election the Court is of Russian nationality, I shall defer to the representative of Romania, which held the presidency during the month of October, to draw lots.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">"I note from your letter dated 7 November 2005 that at the 5299 th meeting of the Security Council the following five candidates received the required majority of votes in the Council: Mr. Mohamed Bennouna, Mr. Thomas Buergenthal, Mr. Kenneth Keith, Mr. Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor and Mr. Leonid Skotnikov.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">"I have informed the General Assembly that the same five candidates obtained the required majority both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council and therefore are elected members of the International Court of Justice."</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">Thus the required majority of votes both in the Security Council and the General Assembly has been received by the same five candidates that I have just named.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">Since both the Security Council and the General Assembly have agreed on the same candidates, the jurists Mr. Mohamed Bennouna, Mr. Thomas Buergenthal, Mr. Kenneth Keith, Mr. Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor and Mr. Leonid Skotnikov have been elected members of the International Court of Justice for a term of office of nine years, beginning on 6 February 2006. I should like to congratulate them and wish them every success in the high office to which they have been elected.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa13">I also wish to thank, on the Council's behalf, the tellers for their assistance in the conduct of the elections."</p>
