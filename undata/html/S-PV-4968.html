<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">I would like stress my delegation's appreciation for the consensus adoption of the resolution extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor, in line with the presentation of a presidential text.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">The delegations of Brazil and Angola were proud to have had the opportunity to draft the present resolution, which guarantees the presence of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Timor-Leste for another six months with a view to extending its mandate for a further six months. We are particularly glad that the international community, through the Security Council, could provide an adequate answer to the request of the Timorese authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">More than that, the resolution adopted is a clear commitment of the international community to peace and security in a country that is only two years of age and that can take pride for so many historic deeds. We praise the people and authorities of Timor-Leste for their tremendous achievements in so short a period of time. We also praise the international community for its great support for the building of this new nation. We are sure that this one-year consolidation phase of the United Nations presence in Timor-Leste will be of the utmost importance to the development of Timor-Leste, its own capabilities and self-sufficiency.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all delegations for their valuable contributions during the negotiations that ended with a rewarding consensus on the adoption of this resolution. Strong support was always displayed for the efforts undertaken by the Timorese Government and people with a view to bringing peace and prosperity to that country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">Finally, I would like to thank once again Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma for his outstanding work in Timor-Leste. We wish him all the best now that he is concluding his term as Special Representative of the Secretary-General for East Timor and returning home for what we hope will be many good years of happiness with his family and friends.</p>
