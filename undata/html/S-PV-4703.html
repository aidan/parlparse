<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council reaffirms its continued commitment to the full and effective implementation of United Nations <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The Council notes the transformation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into Serbia and Montenegro and, in this context, reaffirms that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> remains fully valid in all its aspects. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1244 (1999)</a> continues to be the basis of the international community's policy on Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council further reaffirms its commitment to the objective of a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo and calls upon all communities to work towards this goal and actively participate in the public institutions as well as the decision-making process, and integrate into society. It condemns all attempts to establish and maintain structures and institutions as well as initiatives that are inconsistent with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the Constitutional Framework. The Council calls for the authority of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to be respected throughout Kosovo, and welcomes the establishment of UNMIK's authority in the northern part of Mitrovica. It encourages the establishment of direct dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade on issues of practical importance to both sides.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council condemns the violence within the Kosovo Albanian community, as well as the violence against the Kosovo Serb community. It urges local institutions and leaders to exert influence on the climate for the rule of law by condemning all violence and actively supporting the efforts of the police and the judiciary. It underlines the responsibility of the majority to make the minority communities feel that Kosovo is their home too, and that the laws apply equally to everyone. The minority community representatives must join and work within the institutions to benefit from them. The Council stresses that all communities must make renewed efforts to inject momentum into improving inter-ethnic dialogue and promoting the reconciliation process, not least through full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the activities of UNMIK and recent developments in Kosovo (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-113.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/113</a>) and the briefing of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the status of implementation of the benchmarks for Kosovo. The Council reiterates its full support for the 'Standards before Status' policy with postulated targets in the eight key areas: functioning of the democratic institutions, the rule of law, freedom of movement, the return of refugees and IDPs, economy, property rights, dialogue with Belgrade, and the Kosovo Protection Corps. The Council welcomes the presentation of a detailed plan for its implementation that will provide the appropriate baseline against which progress can be measured, as discussed with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General during the Council's mission in December 2002. The fulfilment of these targets is essential to commencing a political process designed to determine Kosovo's future, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The Council strongly rejects unilateral initiatives which may jeopardize stability and the normalization process not only in Kosovo but also in the entire region. It urges all political leaders in Kosovo and in the region to shoulder responsibility for democratization, peace and stability in the region by rejecting all initiatives contravening <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The Council rejects any attempts to exploit the question of the future of Kosovo for other political ends.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes progress made in 2002, as outlined in the Secretary-General's report. It supports the Special Representative of the Secretary-General's continued efforts, including in such priority areas as revitalizing the economy through investment, combating crime and illegal trafficking, and building a multi-ethnic society, while ensuring conditions for the sustainable return of refugees and IDPs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council welcomes the Special Representative of the Secretary-General's intention to transfer remaining competencies to the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) by the end of the year, except those reserved for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. It calls on the Kosovo PISG as well as all Kosovars to take on their responsibilities and genuinely cooperate for this transfer to be successful.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and urges Kosovo's leaders once again to work in close cooperation with UNMIK and the international Security Presence (KFOR) for a better future for Kosovo and stability in the region."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-1.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
