The members of the Council express heartfelt sympathy to the families of all the victims, and in particular to the relatives of those who lost their lives in the service of the ideals of the United Nations. I request the representatives of Switzerland and the United States of America, as well as the representatives of all other countries whose nationals were aboard the flight, to convey to their Governments and to the bereaved families our deepest condolences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">I now request members of the Council to stand and observe a minute of silence in memory of those who so tragically lost their lives.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">I should like to express appreciation to the Secretariat for the work it has undertaken in preparing this factual report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">I now call on the Director of the Security Council Affairs Division to make an explanatory statement.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa01">The draft annual report of the Security Council for the period 16 June 1997 to 15 June 1998, to be submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations in pursuance of Article 24, paragraph 3, and Article 15, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter, has been prepared by the Secretariat in line with the revised format agreed upon by the Security Council in 1974 and further revised in 1985, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa02">The format of the draft report before the Council provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a concise manner. It corresponds to the Council's decisions on the format. This is the first report prepared in accordance with the measures set out in the note by the President of 12 June 1997, in <a href="../pdf/S-1997-451.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/451</a>, which were aimed at enhancing the analytical nature of the report and accommodating the views expressed on the previous format. It should be noted that the addendum to the report contains monthly assessments prepared by former Presidents of the Security Council under their own responsibility, for the month during which they presided, and following consultations with members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">The draft report was circulated by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 24 August 1998 to the current members of the Security Council and also to the members whose terms of office expired on 31 December 1997, that is, Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the Republic of Korea, for review and comments, if any. Corrigenda containing changes proposed by Council members and by the Secretariat have also been circulated to Council members.</p>
