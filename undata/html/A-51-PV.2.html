	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa01">Pursuant to rule 31 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the election of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa02">All members of the General Assembly are eligible in this election except those already represented in the General Committee, namely, those countries whose representatives have been elected to the presidency of the General Assembly or to the chairmanships of the Main Committees.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa03">In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-33-138.pdf">resolution 33/138</a>, the 21 Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session shall be elected according to the following pattern:</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa10">(f) Representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa11">In accordance with paragraph 16 of annex VI to the rules of procedure, the election of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly by secret ballot will be dispensed with when the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled. We shall proceed accordingly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa12">I shall now read out the names of the endorsed candidates:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa13">African States: Angola, Burundi, Ghana, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Niger, Sudan</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa14">Asian States: Cyprus, Pakistan, Philippines, United Arab Emirates</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa17">Western European and other States: Andorra, Turkey</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa18">Since the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled in each region, I declare those candidates elected, in addition to the representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa19">The following States have therefore been elected to vice-presidencies of the General Assembly: Andorra, Angola, Bahamas, Burundi, China, Cyprus, France, Ghana, Honduras, Latvia, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Niger, Pakistan, Paraguay, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sudan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa20">I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the States which have been elected Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa21">The General Committee for the fifty-first session of the General Assembly has now been fully constituted in accordance with rule 38 of the rules of procedure.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa22">The first meeting of the General Committee will be held tomorrow, Wednesday, 18 September 1996, at 10 a.m. in Conference Room 4.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa01">The Assembly will now turn its attention to document <a href="../pdf/A-51-337.pdf">A/51/337</a>, which contains a letter dated 6 September 1996 from the Chairman of the Committee on Conferences addressed to the President of the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa02">As members are aware, the Assembly, in paragraph 7 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-40-243.pdf">resolution 40/243</a>, decided that no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly should be permitted to meet at United Nations Headquarters during a regular session of the Assembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa03">As indicated in the letter I have just mentioned, the Committee on Conferences has recommended that the General Assembly authorize the Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to meet from 16 to 19 September 1996 and also to authorize the Committee on Conferences, the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, as well as the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations to meet during the fifty-first session, beginning 19 September 1996.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa04">Bearing in mind that one of the dates overlaps with the fifty-first session of the Assembly, and that the others will take place in two days' time, may I take it that the General Assembly adopts the recommendation of the Committee on Conferences?</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg002-bk03">
	It was so decided.
</div>
