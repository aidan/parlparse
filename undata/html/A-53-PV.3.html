As stated in paragraph 17 of the Secretary-General's report, in recent years the closing date has been the Monday before the opening of the next session. Were the General Assembly to retain this practice, the closing date would consistently fall on an official holiday of the Organization, for which financial and other implications may need to be considered. Paragraph 17 of the report further states that the General Assembly may wish to decide on a closing date for future sessions that will fall on a working day.</div>
	<div class="p">In paragraph 43, the General Committee recommends to the Assembly to address the question of the opening and closing dates of future regular sessions.

	<div class="p">As mentioned in paragraph 43, by its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-232">resolution 52/232</a>, the General Assembly decided only on a closing date for the fifty-second session and on an opening date for the fifty-third session. Therefore, it is not yet known when the fifty-third session will close and when the fifty-fourth session will open.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly, during its fifty-third session, should take a decision that will allow Member States and the Secretariat to establish well in advance the exact opening dates of future regular sessions, and consequently their closing dates, as was provided by the present wording of rule 1 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. During the Assembly's consideration of this question, Member States should take into account the observations of the Secretary-General contained in paragraph 17 of his report on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241">resolution 51/241</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">We turn now to section IV of the report of the General Committee, relating to the adoption of the agenda. This section starts with paragraph 44.</div>
	<div class="p">I would first recall rule 23 of the rules of procedure, which provides that:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Debate on the inclusion of an item in the agenda, when that item has been recommended for</div>
	<div class="blockquote">inclusion by the General Committee, shall be limited to three speakers in favour of, and three against, the inclusion."</div>
	<div class="p">I think it is important to point out that the limitation of the number of speakers does not apply to other recommendations.</div>
	<div class="p">I should also like to stress that at this time we are not discussing the substance of any item.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to paragraph 45, may I consider that it is the wish of the Assembly to direct its Main Committees to review their agendas with a view to streamlining their programmes of work, as suggested in that paragraph?</div>

	<div class="p">Since I am now addressing you, Sir, in your capacity as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, allow me to congratulate you on your election to carry out the important task -- that of continuing to shape this international Organization.</div>
	<div class="p">It is unusual for my delegation to comment on the presentation of the report of the General Committee. But as a delegation we have, as of this year, found it necessary to continue to express our committed view -- especially on paragraph 54, which deals with an agenda item which was presented to the General Committee as item 166.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation, being one of the 30 sponsors of this item, wanted to place on the record the fact that this honourable house has a responsibility to the world community to cater for people in multitudes and for people in minorities. It is also the duty of the United Nations to listen to the voiceless and not to pretend that things are right in the world. For this reason, I want to impress upon the Assembly that the question of resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971 should be revisited, so that the United Nations can live up to the standard expected by the people who helped establish it and the people who regard the United Nations as a sanctuary for the voiceless and for those not represented in this Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">I want to assure the Assembly that as long as the question of 21.8 million Taiwanese is ignored by the United Nations, my delegation will continue to co-sponsor an agenda item on this subject. I want also to appeal to those delegations which have not yet seen the light as to why such an item is of significance, that one day it should dawn in their minds that they should under no circumstances undermine the views of the 30 Member States that are in support of this position.</div>
	<div class="p">It was saddening, during the General Committee debate, that some delegations so easily regarded this as a waste of time. My delegation counts that as an insult to our sovereignty and also to the membership of this organ. There is no item that is a matter of triviality. The United Nations, the way I know it, has a duty and an obligation to listen to whatever appeal is made to it.</div>

	<div class="p">The General Assembly has thus concluded its consideration of the first report of the General Committee. I wish to thank all the members of the Assembly for their cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p">Each Main Committee will receive the list of agenda items allocated to it so that it may begin to organize its work in accordance with rule 99 of the rules of procedure and paragraphs 30 and 31 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241">resolution 51/241</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, kindly note that the First Committee, the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), the Third Committee and the Sixth Committee should complete their work by Friday, 20 November, the Second Committee by Friday, 27 November, and the Fifth Committee by Friday, 4 December 1998.</div>
	<div class="p">I hope the Main Committees will continue the effort they demonstrated during the fifty-second session to conclude their work on time.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to recall and underline that all meetings must start punctually, at 10 a.m. and at 3 p.m.; I personally intend to ensure that we all keep to our commitment made today. This undertaking also applies to the Secretariat, which must ensure that all documentation, in all six official languages of the Organization, is available on time so that meetings can proceed without any delay.</div>
	<div class="p">I should now like to draw the attention of representatives to a matter concerning the participation of Palestine, in its capacity as observer, in the sessions and work of the General Assembly. Members will recall <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-250">resolution 52/250</a> of 7 July 1998 and its annex, as well as a note by the Secretary-General contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-1002">A/52/1002</a> that outlines the Secretary-General's understanding of the implementation of the modalities annexed to the resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to draw the Assembly's attention in particular to paragraph 6 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-250">resolution 52/250</a>, which reads as follows:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The right to make interventions, with a precursory explanation or the recall of relevant General Assembly resolutions being made only once by the President of the General Assembly at the start of each session of the Assembly."</div>
	<div class="p">Accordingly, for the fifty-third session of the General Assembly, the observer of Palestine will therefore participate in the work of the General Assembly in accordance with resolution 3237 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-43-177">resolution 43/177</a> of 15 December 1988 and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-250">resolution 52/250</a> of 7 July 1998, with no further need for a precursory explanation prior to any intervention by Palestine in this session.</div>
