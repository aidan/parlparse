	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitments to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia, consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, bearing in mind respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia. It reiterates that full responsibility for achieving national reconciliation and peace rests with the Somali people themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the efforts exerted by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to find a political solution to the crisis in Somalia. It welcomes and fully supports the initiative of the President of Djibouti aimed at restoring peace and stability in Somalia and urges States and international organizations, in a position to do so, to give these efforts political support and to provide financial and technical assistance to the Government of Djibouti to this end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the ongoing abuse of human rights and grave deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Somalia, which has led to death, displacement and the outbreak of diseases among the civilian population, particularly children and other vulnerable groups. It expresses appreciation to the efforts of all United Nations agencies, other organizations and individuals carrying out humanitarian activities in Somalia. The Council strongly condemns attacks by armed groups on innocent civilians and all humanitarian personnel. It strongly urges the Somali factions to respect international humanitarian and human rights law, to ensure the safety and freedom of movement of all humanitarian personnel and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief to all those in need.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council underlines the importance of the widest participation of the representatives of all parts of Somali society in an effort to rehabilitate Somalia. The Council strongly urges representatives of all social and political forces of Somali society to participate actively and in a constructive spirit in the work of the Somali National Peace and Reconciliation Conference in Djibouti. In this regard, it urges the warlords and faction leaders to desist from obstructing and undermining efforts to achieve peace. The Council expresses its readiness to consider taking appropriate steps regarding the warlords and faction leaders who engage in such activities. It also urges all States to stop providing these individuals with the means to carry on their destructive activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reminds all States of their obligation to comply with the measures imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-733(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 733 (1992)</a> and urges them to take all necessary steps to ensure full implementation and enforcement of the arms embargo. The Security Council further urges all States, the United Nations and other international organizations and entities to report to the Committee established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-751(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 751 (1992)</a> information on possible violations of the arms embargo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council remains seized of the matter."</p>
