<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Holliday</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">The adoption today by the Security Council of a resolution to strengthen the implementation and enforcement of the arms embargo imposed under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1493(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1493 (2003)</a> represents a critical step forward in our collective effort to reduce the illegal flow of weapons into the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We join with other delegations in condemning the ongoing violence and loss of life in the Congo perpetuated by these illicit weapons flows.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">Today's resolution creates a sanctions Committee devoted to overseeing implementation of the arms restrictions that the Council authorized in July 2003. My delegation believes that the new Committee can and should play a key role in bringing coordinated, unified Council and international pressure to bear against those who continue to ship arms to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in direct violation of existing multilateral restrictions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">The resolution provides us with helpful tools, such as the new sanctions Committee, that the Council can use to compel adherence by non-compliant parties to the standards and obligations we establish. However, the value of the information and recommendations brought to our attention by the experts will be realized only if the Council acts in response to such findings. The United States stands ready to work closely with other Council members to ensure that the arms embargo imposed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is respected and fully implemented by all parties.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahmood</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa01">In the context of the illegal exploitation of resources, the Pakistan delegation has consistently stated that the tracking of financial resources is important in order to eliminate the root causes of conflict. We would have liked to have an appropriate reflection of that in paragraphs 8 and 10 of the resolution. However, in the spirit of flexibility, we agreed to go along with the text. We will, of course, continue to refer to this subject as we move forward in our work for the implementation of this resolution.</p>
