However, in the light of the serious cash-flow problems besetting the Organization, I feel it is our duty to exercise the utmost discipline and care in ensuring the optimum use of the resources made available for the meetings and work of the Assembly. I wish to reiterate my earnest appeal to members to be at their seats by 10 a.m. so that meetings may start on time. I shall endeavour to begin meetings at the appointed hour, and I shall conclude them by 6 p.m. Similarly, I expect the Chairmen of the Main Committees to exert every effort to carry out their work within the prescribed time-frame. I understand that, with the exceptions I alluded to earlier on, the Secretariat will no longer be able to provide meeting services beyond 6 p.m., notwithstanding measures such as the staggering of staff working hours to avoid overtime costs because of the enormous volume of meetings and documentation already programmed for the period from September to December.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk12-pa02">In paragraph 13, the General Committee recommends that, in order to avoid the late start of meetings, the General Assembly should waive the requirement of the presence of at least one third of the members to declare a plenary meeting open and permit the debate to proceed and of at least one quarter of the members to declare a meeting of a Main Committee open and permit the debate to proceed.

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk14-pa02">In this respect, Main Committees at the outset should review their respective agendas in order to identify items which require immediate action, items which could be taken up at a later date during the period from January to September 1996, and items which could be usefully deferred to a future session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk14-pa03">For my part, I shall strive, with your cooperation, to prepare a programme of work and schedule of plenary meetings that will allow us to consider the items in our agenda expeditiously. With this objective in mind, I should like to request that delegations sponsoring resolutions commence their negotiations early enough so that we can evenly distribute items in the time available to us instead of delaying a large number of them to the end of November and the remaining two or three weeks in December before the holiday season.</div>
