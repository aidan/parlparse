However, in the light of the serious cash-flow problems besetting the Organization, I feel it is our duty to exercise the utmost discipline and care in ensuring the optimum use of the resources made available for the meetings and work of the Assembly. I wish to reiterate my earnest appeal to members to be at their seats by 10 a.m. so that meetings may start on time. I shall endeavour to begin meetings at the appointed hour, and I shall conclude them by 6 p.m. Similarly, I expect the Chairmen of the Main Committees to exert every effort to carry out their work within the prescribed time-frame. I understand that, with the exceptions I alluded to earlier on, the Secretariat will no longer be able to provide meeting services beyond 6 p.m., notwithstanding measures such as the staggering of staff working hours to avoid overtime costs because of the enormous volume of meetings and documentation already programmed for the period from September to December.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa02">In paragraph 13, the General Committee recommends that, in order to avoid the late start of meetings, the General Assembly should waive the requirement of the presence of at least one third of the members to declare a plenary meeting open and permit the debate to proceed and of at least one quarter of the members to declare a meeting of a Main Committee open and permit the debate to proceed.

	<p id="pg005-bk12-pa01">We turn now to section IV of the report of the General Committee, relating to the adoption of the agenda. It begins at paragraph 38.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk12-pa02">I would first recall rule 23 of the rules of procedure, which provides that:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg005-bk12-pa03">"Debate on the inclusion of an item in the agenda, when that item has been recommended for inclusion by the General Committee, shall be limited to three speakers in favour of, and three against, the inclusion."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg005-bk12-pa04">I should like to stress that at this time we are not discussing the substance of any item.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk12-pa05">With regard to paragraph 39, may I consider that it is the wish of the Assembly to direct its Main Committees to review their agenda with a view to streamlining their programme of work as suggested in that paragraph?</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk12-pa06">I see no objection.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk14-pa01">Again, may I urge members of the Assembly to give careful thought to the suggestion by the Secretary-General to consider deferring to a later session items for which decisions or action are not required during the main part of the present session.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk14-pa02">In this respect, Main Committees at the outset should review their respective agendas in order to identify items which require immediate action, items which could be taken up at a later date during the period from January to September 1996, and items which could be usefully deferred to a future session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk14-pa03">For my part, I shall strive, with your cooperation, to prepare a programme of work and schedule of plenary meetings that will allow us to consider the items in our agenda expeditiously. With this objective in mind, I should like to request that delegations sponsoring resolutions commence their negotiations early enough so that we can evenly distribute items in the time available to us instead of delaying a large number of them to the end of November and the remaining two or three weeks in December before the holiday season.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk14-pa04">In paragraph 40, the General Committee, with regard to item 20 (c) of the draft agenda, recommends that the General Assembly consider the question of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction as a separate sub-item under item 98 (Environment and sustainable development).</p>
