	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to documents <a href="../pdf/S-1995-349.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/349</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1995-351.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/351</a>, which contain the texts of two letters dated 2 and 3 May 1995 respectively, from the Permanent Representative of Croatia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council is deeply concerned at the continuation of hostilities in the Republic of Croatia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms in this context its statement of 1 May 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-23.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/23</a>) in all its aspects, and demands that the parties comply with the requirements set out therein immediately and in full.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council condemns the incursions into the zone of separation by the forces of the Government of the Republic of Croatia in Sectors North and South, and by both sides in Sector East. It demands that the forces in question withdraw immediately.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council also condemns the bombardment of Zagreb and other centres of civilian population by the forces of the local Serb authorities and demands that they cease immediately.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council further condemns acts of harassment and intimidation against United Nations personnel and reminds the parties of their obligations to respect such personnel at all times and to ensure their safety, security and freedom of movement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council calls on the parties to cooperate fully with UNCRO, UNHCR and the ICRC in protecting and assisting the local civilian population and any displaced persons. The Council is deeply concerned by reports that the human rights of the Serb population of Western Slavonia are being violated. It demands that the Government of the Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the Serb population concerned in conformity with internationally recognized standards.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council insists that the authority of UNCRO be re-established and respected in Sector West and other areas affected by the hostilities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council demands that the parties act in accordance with the proposals put to them by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, that they cease all hostilities immediately, and that they cooperate fully with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and with UNCRO.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council further calls upon the parties to enter without delay into the discussions in Geneva to which they have been invited by the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter and will be ready to consider further steps as necessary."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-26.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/26</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
