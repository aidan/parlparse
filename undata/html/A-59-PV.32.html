	<blockquote indent="35"><b>Third report of the General Committee</b> <b>(<a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/250">A/59/250</a>/Add.2)</b></blockquote>
<p><b>The President</b>  (<i>spoke in French</i>): In the first paragraph of its third report, the General Committee recommends to the General Assembly that an additional item, entitled "Observer status for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States in the General Assembly", be included in the agenda of the current session under heading I, that is, organizational, administrative and other matters.</p>
<p>May I take it that the General Assembly decides to include this item in the agenda of the current session under heading I?</p>
	<blockquote indent="36"><i>It was so decided.</i></blockquote>
<p><b>The President</b>  (<i>spoke in French</i>): The General Committee further recommends that the item be allocated to the Sixth Committee.</p>
<p>May I take it that the General Assembly decides to allocate this item to the Sixth Committee?</p>
	<blockquote indent="36"><i>It was so decided.</i></blockquote>
<p><b>The President</b> (<i>spoke in French</i>): I should like to inform members that the item entitled "Observer status for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States in the General Assembly" will become item 160 on the agenda of the current session.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Sixth Committee will be informed of the decision just taken by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>In paragraph 2 of the same document, the General Committee recommends to the General Assembly that the consideration of agenda item 21, "The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict", and agenda item 24, "Prevention of armed conflict", be separated.</p>

	<blockquote indent="36"><i>It was so decided.</i></blockquote>
<p><b>The President</b>  (<i>spoke in French</i>): I now wish to draw the attention of members to paragraph 3 of the report of the General Committee. In that paragraph, the Committee took note of the information that agenda item 21, "The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict", and agenda item 24, "Prevention of armed conflict", would be rescheduled separately at a later date to be announced. <b>Agenda item 15</b></p>
<p><b>Election to fill vacancies in principal organs</b></p>
	<blockquote indent="35"><b>(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the</b> <b>Security Council</b></blockquote>
<p><b>The President</b>  (<i>spoke in French</i>): The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of five non- permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2004.</p>
<p>The five outgoing non-permanent members are the following: Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain. Those five States cannot be re-elected. Their names, therefore, should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
<p>Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in the year 2005 the following States: Algeria, Benin, Brazil, the Philippines and Romania. The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
<p>Of the five non-permanent members that will remain in office in the year 2005, three are from Africa and Asia, one is from Eastern Europe, and one is from Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: two from Africa and Asia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean, and two from Western Europe and Other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.</p>
<p>In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to be elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa and one from Asia.</p>
<p>I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
<p>May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>
	<blockquote indent="36"><i>It was so decided.</i></blockquote>
<p><b>The President</b>  (<i>spoke in French</i>): In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.</p>
<p>The representative of Eritrea has asked to speak on a point of order.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Baduri</b> (Eritrea): I am taking the floor to formally withdraw the candidature of the State of Eritrea for membership in the Security Council in favour of the United Republic of Tanzania. The Government of Eritrea takes this decision in spite of the legitimacy of its candidature based on the criteria of the hallowed tradition of the African Group. This withdrawal demonstrates Eritrea's sense of responsibility and concern for the spirit of African solidarity. The Government of Eritrea is supremely confident that Tanzania will enhance the contributions of Africa to the effectiveness of the Council.</p>
<p>At this juncture, I wish to warmly thank the Member countries that have expressed support for the candidature of Eritrea since we announced it, by way of note verbale, on 10 February 2004.</p>
<p>I also wish to inform the Assembly that Eritrea reserves its right to submit its candidature during the next election for the non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the Eastern Africa subregion.</p>
<p>Finally, I request that this statement be reflected in the official records of the General Assembly this morning.</p>
<p><b>The President</b>  (<i>spoke in French</i>): Regarding candidatures, and taking into account the statement just made by the representative of Eritrea, the following are the candidates endorsed by their respective regional groups. For the two vacant seats from among the African and Asian States, there are two endorsed candidates, namely, Japan and the United Republic of Tanzania. For the vacant seat from among the Latin American and Caribbean States, there is one endorsed candidate, namely, Argentina. For the two vacant seats from among the Western European and other States, there are two endorsed candidates, namely, Denmark and Greece.</p>
<p>In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.</p>
<p>Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>
	<blockquote indent="36">We shall now begin the voting process.</blockquote>
<p>Ballot papers marked "A", "B" and "C" will now be distributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot papers that have been distributed.</p>
<p>May I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers marked "A", for the African and Asian States, the names of the two States for which they wish to vote; on the ballot papers marked "B", for the Latin American and Caribbean States, the name of the one State for which they wish to vote; and on the ballot papers marked "C", for the Western European and other States, the names of the two States for which they wish to vote.</p>
<p>A ballot paper containing more names from the relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a ballot paper that do not belong to that region will not be counted.</p>

<p><b>The President</b>  (<i>spoke in French</i>): I congratulate the States that have been elected members of the Security Council, and I thank the tellers for their assistance in the election.</p>
