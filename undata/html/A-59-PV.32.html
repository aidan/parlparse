	<div class="p">The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2004.</div>
	<div class="p">The five outgoing non-permanent members are the following: Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain. Those five States cannot be re-elected. Their names, therefore, should not appear on the ballot papers.</div>
	<div class="p">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in the year 2005 the following States: Algeria, Benin, Brazil, the Philippines and Romania. The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot papers.</div>
	<div class="p">Of the five non-permanent members that will remain in office in the year 2005, three are from Africa and Asia, one is from Eastern Europe, and one is from Latin America and the Caribbean.</div>
	<div class="p">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: two from Africa and Asia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean, and two from Western Europe and Other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to be elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa and one from Asia.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</div>

	<div class="p">I am taking the floor to formally withdraw the candidature of the State of Eritrea for membership in the Security Council in favour of the United Republic of Tanzania. The Government of Eritrea takes this decision in spite of the legitimacy of its candidature based on the criteria of the hallowed tradition of the African Group. This withdrawal demonstrates Eritrea's sense of responsibility and concern for the spirit of African solidarity. The Government of Eritrea is supremely confident that Tanzania will enhance the contributions of Africa to the effectiveness of the Council.</div>
	<div class="p">At this juncture, I wish to warmly thank the Member countries that have expressed support for the candidature of Eritrea since we announced it, by way of note verbale, on 10 February 2004.</div>
	<div class="p">I also wish to inform the Assembly that Eritrea reserves its right to submit its candidature during the next election for the non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the Eastern Africa subregion.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, I request that this statement be reflected in the official records of the General Assembly this morning.</div>
