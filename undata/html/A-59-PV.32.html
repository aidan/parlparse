	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa05">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: two from Africa and Asia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean, and two from Western Europe and Other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa06">In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to be elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa and one from Asia.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I am taking the floor to formally withdraw the candidature of the State of Eritrea for membership in the Security Council in favour of the United Republic of Tanzania. The Government of Eritrea takes this decision in spite of the legitimacy of its candidature based on the criteria of the hallowed tradition of the African Group. This withdrawal demonstrates Eritrea's sense of responsibility and concern for the spirit of African solidarity. The Government of Eritrea is supremely confident that Tanzania will enhance the contributions of Africa to the effectiveness of the Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa02">At this juncture, I wish to warmly thank the Member countries that have expressed support for the candidature of Eritrea since we announced it, by way of note verbale, on 10 February 2004.</div>
