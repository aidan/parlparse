	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council reiterates its grave concern at the continued violence and instability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and at reports of threats to the peace and transition process. It condemns in the strongest terms any involvement by outside forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council urges all Congolese parties to remain fully committed to the peace process of the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement and to respect the Government of National Unity and Transition as the sole legitimate governing authority in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It warns all parties against any attempt to seize power by force. It urges all parties to refrain from statements or actions which might inflame the situation, including by supporting armed elements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council warns all parties against any attempt at engaging in belligerent actions or violations of the embargo imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1493(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1493 (2003)</a> in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It invites the Secretary-General to further determine the need for a possible rapid-reaction capability for the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council calls on the Government of National Unity and Transition to begin work immediately with the International Committee in Support of the Transition and with MONUC to establish mechanisms for closer coordination in order to expedite security sector reform, the adoption of essential legislation and electoral preparations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council urges the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda to respond without further delay to MONUC's efforts taken under its current mandate to establish, as soon as possible, a joint verification mechanism for their common security, including verification of cross-border movements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council strongly encourages the heads of State of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi to work together to reduce tensions and restore confidence in the region, in accordance with the commitments made in the Declaration on Good-Neighbourly Relations of 25 September 2003, including by holding meetings at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council urges Rwanda not to provide any practical or political support to armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular those led by Mr. Laurent Nkunda or Mr. Jules Mutebusi. It further urges Rwanda to use its influence positively to de-escalate the current crisis and support the restoration of stability.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council reminds Uganda not to interfere in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including through military support for armed groups.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council calls on Burundi to prevent any support from its territory to armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It encourages the Transitional Government to facilitate humanitarian assistance for Congolese refugees now in Burundi, and the international community to provide its full assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council underlines that any attempt to disrupt the peace and transition process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including through support for armed groups, will not be tolerated.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council condemns the deaths of innocent  civilians and human rights  abuses in the East of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and calls for such incidents to be fully investigated. Those responsible for atrocities and human rights abuses should be held to account, and the Government of National Unity and Transition should take immediate steps, with support from the international community, to reverse the current climate of impunity."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-21.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/21</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
