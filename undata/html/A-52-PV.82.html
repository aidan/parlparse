<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Thorne</span><span class="nation">United Kingdom</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg005-bk09-pa01">I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union on the issue of procurement reform. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated country Cyprus align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg005-bk09-pa02">We would first like to take this opportunity to thank the coordinator of this item in the Fifth Committee, Mr. Miles Armitage, for his professionalism in bringing together consensus on such an important issue.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg005-bk09-pa03">The European Union attaches the greatest importance to the issue of procurement reform, which is the subject of the resolution we have just adopted in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-746-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/746/Add.1</a>. We made the strength of our views clear during our introductory statement on this issue when the debate was resumed in the Fifth Committee three weeks ago.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg005-bk09-pa04">That this debate will once again have to be resumed at our next session is a cause of considerable disappointment and, indeed, some disquiet. This is an area where the United Nations is exposed to commercial society. Its performance in recent years has left much to be desired. Repeated calls by the Member States for fundamental reform have led to little or no significant movement. That we achieved consensus on this resolution with relative ease demonstrates our common conviction of that unfortunate situation. Delegations were unanimous on many important issues, not least in their call for the early implementation of revised financial regulations and the long-awaited rules governing procurement procedures. We have asked for these to be submitted in good time for the next resumed session of the Fifth Committee, which will begin on 11 May.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg005-bk09-pa05">We also ask the Secretary-General to examine and report on three other key areas, which I will enumerate briefly as follows: first, ways in which developing countries and countries with economies in transition might gain a larger share of United Nations procurement; secondly, ways in which those who are fully paid up with their contributions to the United Nations might be given some measure of priority in the conclusion of procurement contracts -- we are particularly interested in the experience of the World Bank in this context; and, thirdly, ways in which the structure of the Procurement Division might be better adapted to meet the needs of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg005-bk09-pa06">For the first two of these issues, we have asked for reports to be submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. The European Union believes that these reports should be made available no later than the autumn of 1998.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg005-bk09-pa07">On the third point, the issue of the structure and staffing of the Procurement Division, there was some disagreement between Member States. The European Union has consistently supported the Secretary-General's own view that he requires a highly qualified officer at the level of D-2, with experience of top-level procurement, to run United Nations operations. We continue to believe that such an experienced pair of hands is necessary to deal with these important issues where the United Nations must interact with top international commercial competition.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg005-bk09-pa08">We were pleased that Mr. Connor, the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management, found the time to come and introduce this issue to the Fifth Committee. We were also happy to welcome Mr. Niwa, the responsible Acting Assistant Secretary-General, to some of our informal consultations on these important matters. We trust we can rely on their personal interest in an area which will continue to attract attention.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV82-pg008-bk10-pa03">Finally, I should like to express the appreciation of the Group of 77 and China to those who worked in support of the decision and also to request at this time that the Secretary-General work to fully implement the decision in its letter and spirit so that we may avoid further debate on the subject in the future.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV82-pg008-bk11-pa01">I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union on the issue of United Nations holidays and draft decision I, which we have just adopted. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- as well as the European Free-Trade Area countries members of the European Economic Area, Iceland and Liechtenstein, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg008-bk11-pa02">The European Union very much regretted that in the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly some delegations insisted upon reopening the very carefully balanced <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-214.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 52/214</a>, which we had adopted only three months earlier. Last week the European Union was obliged to vote against a text which changed the carefully balanced agreement therein.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg008-bk11-pa03">It is always regrettable when the Fifth Committee resorts to voting. In order not to repeat that procedure, the European Union has acquiesced in consensus on this occasion. I would, however, recall that the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management, Ms. Salim, informed the Fifth Committee on 26 March that the Secretary-General continued to believe that he had fully complied with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-214.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 52/214</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg008-bk11-pa04">This confirmed our own understanding of the position. While it is for the General Assembly to decide upon the number of official holidays to be accorded, it is for the Secretary-General, in consultation with the staff, to decide upon their allocation. To our knowledge, the General Assembly has never in the past instructed the Secretary-General in this way to allocate official holidays in any specific fashion. In our view, it is wrong for it to do so now. We therefore deeply regret the action we have taken, first in the Fifth Committee and now here today, which impinges directly upon the authority of the Secretary-General and contravenes the principles of the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg008-bk11-pa05">The United Nations is, like the European Union itself, an Organization of Member States which spans such a broad range of traditions that, in order to respect all, it must not privilege any. For this reason we attach the greatest importance to the principles of equality enshrined in the Charter. That is why we worked so hard to support those who sought to explore all possible means to avoid this outcome.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk01-pa01">I take the floor today to address an issue of concern to the United States, but one which we do not believe needed to come to this pass. The issue of what holidays should be officially celebrated at United Nations Headquarters and its duty stations has become one of the most sensitive issues which the General Assembly has considered at this session.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk01-pa02">We are deeply concerned that the decision increases the number of officially observed holidays. While we trust the assurances from the Secretariat that increasing the number of holidays will not have financial and budgetary implications, our concerns remain straightforward: we should not send a contradictory signal to the world that, at a time when reform of this Organization should be paramount, we would increase the number of officially recognized holidays in which the staff has additional time off.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk01-pa03">The United Nations needs to be made more efficient and cost-effective; increasing the number of officially observed holidays does not work towards the goal of United Nations reform. The perception alone of such a move is contrary to reform.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk01-pa04">We are also concerned that the decision undermines the Secretary-General's prerogative as chief administrative officer of the Organization, to establish the holidays observed at the different duty stations, on the basis of the customs and practices of the various host countries. We note that the United Nations currently recognizes over 50 holidays, which are celebrated as appropriate at the various United Nations headquarters and duty stations.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk01-pa05">Finally -- and this is perhaps the most sensitive aspect -- we remain deeply concerned that the current decision to make mandatory the observance of two religious holidays at all United Nations duty stations is not in conformity with the secular nature of the United Nations; nor does it promote equity among the very diverse religions and cultures of the Member States of the Organization, as reflected in the spirit and intent of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk01-pa06">During discussions in the Fifth Committee, the United States expressed all these concerns and sought to amend the proposed decision in order to find a reasonable compromise. Unfortunately, our efforts did not prevail. Nonetheless, we reluctantly join consensus at this time on the proposed decision.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk02-pa01">Having joined in the adoption of draft decision I, I should like to make a brief statement to explain my delegation's position.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk02-pa02">Earlier on, my delegation had to vote against the draft decision (A/C.5/52/L.26) in the Fifth Committee because the matter was prematurely put to the vote before every effort to achieve consensus had been exhausted. That is a well-established tradition in that Committee. Also, the draft decision appears to depart from the understanding of Member States at the time when the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-214.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 52/214</a> A a few months ago during the current session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk02-pa03">My delegation believes that official holidays at each Secretariat duty station should be more appropriately designated within the purview of the Secretary-General as chief administrative officer of the Organization rather than instructed by a decision of the General Assembly. Therefore, my delegation welcomes the most recent efforts made, which have led to the plenary taking action today without a vote. We are pleased with the statement made today by Under-Secretary-General Jin on behalf of the Secretariat that through the Secretary-General's administrative adjustment, the present decision will not entail programme budget implications.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg009-bk02-pa04">Based on this clarification, my delegation takes that decision to be consistent with the understanding of Member States reached at the time of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-214.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 52/214</a> A. It is for this reason that my delegation has decided to join the consensus adoption of the present decision in a spirit of cooperation and compromise.</p>

To me, the adoption of the draft decision designating Ed Al-Fitr and Ed Al-Adha as United Nations holidays represents a new epoch of equality within this, our United Nations. Our member States are very active in the work of the United Nations. A number of our citizens are civil servants of this Organization, and it is about time that our rights and theirs are recognized. We do not believe that this is a regional Organization, nor do we believe that secularism or financial implications had anything to do with any position taken by any country. We think there is something other than that. But this is all behind us now, and again I extend my thanks to all.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV82-pg010-bk02-pa01">My delegation is pleased to associate itself with the consensus that has emerged today on this issue. We are pleased mainly because a vote was avoided and we have returned to the procedure that is most suited to this kind of decision.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg010-bk02-pa02"><i>(spoke in English)</i></p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg010-bk02-pa03">We regretted that this matter was forced to a vote in the Fifth Committee, and we are glad that it has been avoided today.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg010-bk02-pa04">My delegation has supported this decision, principally on the basis of its own national practice. To have 10 days of official holidays generally conforms to Canadian practice, and is in fact slightly less generous than Canadian practice. My delegation finds it necessary to recall, however, that the United Nations is not a sectarian Organization. It does not observe the holy days of any religion in any religious sense. Instead, its legislative bodies decide not to meet from time to time, in deference to the needs and religious devotions of Member States and their representatives, and at each duty station the Secretariat does not work on a set number of days which are decided by the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg010-bk02-pa05">My delegation continues to believe that the selection of staff holidays at each duty station must continue to be set by the Secretary-General in consultation with the staff, in accordance with the Charter and the staff rules. The decision which we have adopted today does not diminish the authority of the Secretary-General. We therefore welcome the statement made here today by the representative of the Secretary-General, in whom we continue to have complete confidence.</p>

	<p id="docA52PV82-pg010-bk03-pa01">My delegation believes strongly in the importance of the principle of consensus decision-making, particularly in relation to financial and administrative issues in the United Nations. We accept that we will not always be fully comfortable with the compromises this approach inevitably requires, but we take the view that our long-term interests and the interests of the Organization are best served by the consensus approach.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg010-bk03-pa02">We have joined consensus on this occasion in adopting draft decision I, but with reservations as to the way it has been achieved and in particular the fact that it is underpinned by a vote in the Fifth Committee. Voting on such an issue was, in our view, an extremely disappointing development which we hope will remain an exception to usual practice.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg010-bk03-pa03">My delegation attaches considerable importance to, and will argue strongly for, the right of all Members to observe their religious, cultural or political traditions. However, that was not at issue in the present case. The departure from the use of local practice as the primary criterion for designating official holidays raises concerns, both as a possible precedent and in light of the secular nature of the Organization. In our view, the designation of official holidays in the United Nations is the responsibility of the Secretary-General, in consultation with staff, taking into account local practice at each duty station.</p>
	<p id="docA52PV82-pg010-bk03-pa04">We are concerned also about the implications of this decision for the authority of the Secretary-General as the chief administrative officer and for the integrity of the staff-management relationship. We are pleased with the Secretariat's statement here today.</p>
