	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members have before them the progress report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda, which is contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1995-297.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/297</a>, and the third report of the Secretary-General on security in the Rwandese refugee camps, which is contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1995-304.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/304</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1995-310.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/310</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 13 April 1995 from the Permanent Representative of Rwanda to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council has considered the Secretary-General's progress report on the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-297.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/297</a>, of 9 April 1995) and his third report on security in the Rwandese refugee camps (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-304.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/304</a>, of 14 April 1995), as well as the oral briefings from the Secretariat on the tragic events on 22 April 1995 at the Kibeho camp for internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council condemns the killing of numerous civilians in the camp and is encouraged by the decision of the Government of Rwanda to carry out a full investigation of these events without delay and to bring to justice those responsible. In this regard it welcomes the decision of the Rwandese authorities to establish an independent inquiry with United Nations and other international participation to carry out this investigation of the events. The Council also requests the Secretary-General to report to it, without delay, on these events and on the role of UNAMIR.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council is concerned by the generally deteriorating security situation in Rwanda. It underlines that the Government of Rwanda bears primary responsibility for maintaining security throughout the country and for the safety of internally displaced persons and returnees, as well as for ensuring respect for their basic human rights. In this context it reaffirms the need for coordination between the Government of Rwanda and UNAMIR and other agencies on these matters. The Council does, however, note with satisfaction that the Government of Rwanda has in previous months made considerable efforts directed at national reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction, which are of crucial importance. The Council calls on the Government of Rwanda to intensify these efforts and on the international community to continue to support those efforts, in order to bring about a climate of trust and confidence which would assist in the early and safe return of refugees. In this context, it underlines the importance it attaches to demining, including the United Nations proposal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council notes with deep concern disturbing reports of increased incursions into Rwanda from neighbouring countries, allegations of arms shipments into the Goma airport and of elements of the former Rwandese Government forces being trained in a neighbouring country. It calls upon all States, especially those neighbouring Rwanda, to refrain from any action that would further exacerbate the security situation in that country and to prevent incursions into Rwanda from their own territories. The Council invites States and organizations which have information on the transport of arms into countries neighbouring Rwanda for the purpose of their use in Rwanda in contravention of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 918 (1994)</a> to pass that information to the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 918 (1994)</a> and requests the Committee to consider that information as a matter of urgency and to report thereon to the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction that the deployment of the Zairian Camp Security Contingent and the Civilian Security Liaison Group has had a positive effect on the security situation in refugee camps in Zaire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council pays tribute to all members of UNAMIR. It reaffirms that UNAMIR constitutes one essential factor for creating a climate of confidence and for promoting stability and security. In this context, it underlines the responsibility of the Government of Rwanda for the safety and security of all UNAMIR personnel and other international staff serving in the country. It urges the Rwandese authorities to proceed with the exchange of letters supplementing the agreement on the status of UNAMIR and its personnel, reflecting the changes in UNAMIR's mandate following from <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 918 (1994)</a>. The Council calls for increased cooperation and collaboration between the Government of Rwanda, its neighbouring countries and UNAMIR as well as other agencies, including in the humanitarian field.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council expresses grave concern at the situation created by the overcrowded prisons in Rwanda which has resulted in the death of numerous persons in custody and requests the Secretary-General to consider urgently measures which could be taken quickly in conjunction with the Government of Rwanda and humanitarian agencies to improve the conditions of those in detention or under investigation. The Council emphasizes that the development of the Rwandese justice system continues to be an important factor in creating conditions of security, law and order, conducive to the return of refugees from abroad and of displaced persons to their homes. The Council calls on the international community to assist the Government of Rwanda in re-establishing the justice system as a contribution to confidence-building and the maintenance of law and order.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council expresses its appreciation for the action of those States which have arrested and detained persons following the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-978(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 978 (1995)</a>. It urges States, in accordance with that resolution, to arrest and detain persons against whom there is sufficient evidence of responsibility for acts within the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal for Rwanda. It requests the Secretary-General to facilitate the rapid establishment of the Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">"The Security Council requests the Government of Rwanda to facilitate the delivery and distribution of humanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced persons in need, in conformity with the principles and current practice of UNHCR. It invites States and donor agencies to deliver on their earlier commitments and to further increase their assistance. It urges all Governments in the region to keep their borders open for this purpose.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">"The Security Council appeals to all States to act in accordance with recommendations adopted in the Regional Conference on Assistance to Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in the Great Lakes Region held in Bujumbura in February 1995, in order to contribute to facilitate the return of refugees. The Council welcomes the Dar-es-Salaam trilateral agreement of 12 April 1995, on the voluntary repatriation of Rwandese refugees from Tanzania.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">"The Security Council reaffirms the view that an international conference would contribute substantially to peace and security in the subregion. It welcomes the intention of the Secretary-General to carry out consultations with all concerned so that such a conference can be held at the earliest possible date.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">"The Security Council will remain seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa17">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-22.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/22</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa18">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa19">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
