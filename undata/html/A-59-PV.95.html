	<div class="p">Thirdly, the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services should serve for one fixed term of five years without possibility of renewal.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services might be removed by the Secretary-General only for cause and with the approval of the General Assembly.</div>
