	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them photocopies of a letter dated 15 February 2008 from the Permanent Representative of Eritrea to the President of the Security Council, which will be issued as <a href="../pdf/S-2008-100.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2008/100</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council recalls that, on 30 January 2008, it adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1798(2008).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1798 (2008)</a> on the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE). The Security Council is following with the utmost concern the situation confronting the Mission. It expresses its full support for the efforts of the Secretary-General to address this problem.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council notes with great concern that, by maintaining restrictions on UNMEE despite the Council's numerous demands, and by refusing to reinstate fuel deliveries to UNMEE, the Government of Eritrea has created a situation in which a temporary relocation of personnel and equipment from Eritrea has been rendered inevitable. The Security Council also expresses deep concern about the impediments and logistical constraints put on the Mission in its attempts to organize this temporary relocation. The Security Council condemns such steps taken by Eritrea.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council strongly condemns the lack of cooperation from the Government of Eritrea, which not only gravely contravenes United Nations Security Council resolutions and the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities of 18 June 2000 (<a href="../pdf/S-2000-601.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/601</a>), but also fails to comply with Eritrea's general obligation to assist forces that have been stationed with its consent. The Security Council holds Eritrea responsible for the safety and security of the Mission and its personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council demands that the Government of Eritrea resume full cooperation with UNMEE, including by ending all its restrictions on the Mission, and abide by all its obligations as a United Nations Member State.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its determination to closely monitor the situation and to consider further appropriate steps for the safety and protection of the Mission and its personnel."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-7.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/7</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
