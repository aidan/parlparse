	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the second report of the Secretary-General on security in the Rwandese refugee camps, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-65.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/65</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1995-127.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/127</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 1 February 1995 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, and <a href="../pdf/S-1995-103.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/103</a>, containing the text of a letter dated 1 February 1995 from the Permanent Representative of Rwanda to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council has considered the second report of the Secretary-General, dated 25 January 1995, on the security in the Rwandese refugee camps (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-65.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/65</a>), particularly those located in Zaire, and his letter dated 1 February 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-127.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/127</a>) on this subject.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council agrees with the Secretary-General's assessment that the present situation in many of the refugee camps remains dangerous for both refugees and relief workers and that the situation is also potentially destabilizing for the subregion as a whole. It is gravely concerned at reports of continuing intimidation and security problems in the camps, particularly in Zaire, and reaffirms its condemnation of actions of former Rwandese leaders living in the camps, and of former Government forces and militias, to prevent, in some cases by force, the repatriation of the refugees. It also remains concerned at the security threat to international relief workers. It welcomes the steps taken by some of the host countries concerned to improve the security situation in the camps. The Council remains concerned at the obstacles posed by the former civil and military authorities and militias to effective local administration by the host countries and the discharge by UNHCR of its mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council attaches great importance to the earliest possible action to address the security problems in the camps. In this context it welcomes the decision that UNHCR, under its refugee protection and humanitarian assistance mandate, conclude appropriate arrangements with the Government of Zaire to enhance security in the camps. It welcomes the agreement between UNHCR and the Government of Zaire of 27 January 1995 to deploy 1,500 Zairian security forces and a UNHCR liaison group. It also welcomes the agreement reached between the Governments of Zaire and Rwanda on the return of refugees and property and urges its full implementation. The Security Council urges Member States to provide UNHCR with the resources needed in the context of the agreement concluded between it and the Government of Zaire. It stresses the importance of close coordination of all operations with UNAMIR. The Council endorses the efforts of UNHCR, in cooperation with the United Republic of Tanzania, to put in place security arrangements in the Tanzanian camps, and encourages UNHCR also to address the situation in Burundi. The Council requests the Secretary-General to report to it on a regular basis on the implementation of operations carried out by UNHCR.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council stresses the importance of ensuring that accurate information about the situation inside Rwanda is disseminated to the camps. In this respect, it reaffirms the importance of UNAMIR Radio commencing its broadcasts as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council encourages efforts to provide security in the camps and notes that they have to be accompanied by further efforts in Rwanda to ensure that refugees can return to their homes without fear of retribution or persecution. In this regard it acknowledges the achievements of the Government of Rwanda, despite the difficulty of the task and the lack of resources. It encourages the Government of Rwanda to continue to provide a framework for the action to be taken to repatriate the refugees, to promote national reconciliation and to reinvigorate the political process, and calls upon the international community to continue to support the Government of Rwanda in its task. The Council reaffirms its view that such a framework should also include an appropriate mechanism for sustaining a dialogue between the Government of Rwanda, the refugee community and the United Nations. It welcomes the conclusions of the summit meeting of leaders in the subregion, held in Nairobi on 7 January 1995. The Council encourages the International Tribunal for Rwanda established in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-955(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 955 (1994)</a> in its work, as well as efforts to rebuild the local Rwandese judicial system to facilitate the maintenance of law and order. The Council welcomes the commitments made at the recent Round-table Conference on Rwanda and in response to the consolidated inter-agency appeal that will assist the Government of Rwanda in its efforts to rebuild the country and to promote national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council looks forward to the regional conference on assistance to refugees, returnees and displaced persons in the Great Lakes region, to be hosted by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and UNHCR in Bujumbura from 15 to 17 February 1995. The Council expresses the hope that this conference will lead to further progress in creating the conditions necessary for the refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes and that it will facilitate the identification of long-term solutions to promote and ensure peace, security and development in the subregion, those issues to be the subject matter of a further and broader conference of a political nature.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council underlines that the presence of the refugee camps should only be temporary and that the return of the refugees to their homes in Rwanda remains the ultimate goal. It requests the Secretary-General to continue his exploration of all options and to make any further recommendations necessary for ensuring security in the camps as soon as possible and to submit a further report on this subject in the light of the outcome of the conference in Bujumbura.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council will remain seized of the matter and will keep it under close review."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-7.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/7</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
