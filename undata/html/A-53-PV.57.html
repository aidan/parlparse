	<div class="p">This afternoon, the General Assembly will continue with the election of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1998.</div>

	<div class="p">In accordance with the rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to the second round of balloting, by secret ballot, for the remaining two seats.</div>
	<div class="p">This second round of balloting shall be restricted to the four States from among the Eastern European States that were not elected but that obtained the largest number of votes in the previous ballot -- namely, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Moldova and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</div>
	<div class="p">This is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure.</div>
	<div class="p">Ballot papers marked "C", for the Eastern European States, will now be distributed. May I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers the names of the two States for which they wish to vote.</div>
	<div class="p">Ballot papers marked "C" will be declared invalid if they contain the names of States other than Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Moldova or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as well as if they contain the names of more than two States.</div>
