<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Somalia, <a href="../pdf/S-2004-469.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2004/469</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council, recalling its previous decisions concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular the statement of its President of 25 February 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-3.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/3</a>), and welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of June 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-469.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/469</a>), reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia and its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of the country, consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its firm support for the Somali national reconciliation process and the ongoing Somali National Reconciliation Conference in Kenya, launched under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and commends the IGAD leaders and in particular the Government of Kenya for their efforts in the search for peace in Somalia. The Council also commends the international observers for their active engagement in the process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the outcome of the fifth, sixth and seventh IGAD Ministerial Facilitation Committee meetings on the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, which demonstrated the coherent regional approach and commitment of IGAD member States to national reconciliation in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the launching of phase III of the Somali National Reconciliation Conference and encourages all parties to continue in their ongoing efforts to move the process forward and agree on a durable and inclusive solution to the conflict in Somalia and the establishment of a transitional federal Government for Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council recognizes that, while the establishment of a transitional federal Government will be an important step towards establishing sustainable peace and stability in Somalia, much effort will lie ahead if this objective is to be achieved. The Council emphasizes the need for the new Government, once formed, to engage with the international community and to use the transition period constructively for the purposes of reconciliation, stability and reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates that the Somali parties should abide by and implement expeditiously the Eldoret Declaration of 27 October 2002 on the cessation of hostilities (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1359.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1359</a>) and calls on the Somali parties to continue working towards a comprehensive security arrangement for Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council reiterates that the Somali parties themselves bear the main responsibility for achieving a comprehensive ceasefire throughout Somalia. The Council calls on the Somali parties to fully implement the ceasefire, to ensure security and to resolve their differences through peaceful means.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council condemns those who obstruct the peace process, in this regard fully supports the warning of the IGAD ministers, and reiterates that those who persist on the path of confrontation and conflict will be held accountable. The Council will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council welcomes the decision by the African Union to dispatch a reconnaissance mission to prepare the ground for the deployment of military monitors to Somalia and calls upon Somali leaders to cooperate with this initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council calls on the international community to continue to support IGAD in its facilitation of the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, and calls on the donor countries and organizations to contribute to the Conference, the United Nations Trust Fund for Peace-building in Somalia and the United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council reiterates serious concern regarding the humanitarian situation in Somalia and calls on Somali leaders to facilitate the delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance and to assure the safety of all international and national aid workers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">"The Security Council reiterates its concern over the continued flow of weapons and ammunition supplies to Somalia, commends the work of the Monitoring Group established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1519(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1519 (2003)</a> of 16 December 2003, and urges relevant States and entities to comply scrupulously with the arms embargo and to cooperate with the Monitoring Group.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">"The Security Council commends the work of Mr. Winston Tubman, the Representative of the Secretary-General, welcomes his visit to the region in support of the IGAD-sponsored Somali peace process, and encourages him to continue his facilitation efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's meeting with the Somali parties on 8 July 2004 in Mbagathi, Kenya, and requests the Secretary-General to keep the Council regularly informed on developments at the Somali National Reconciliation Conference and to make timely recommendations on what additional measures could be taken by the Council in support of the Conference and its outcome."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-24.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/24</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa19">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
