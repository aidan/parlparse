	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-436.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/436</a>) and the briefing by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and supports all efforts by the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the international security presence (KFOR) to implement fully <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> of 10 June 1999, which remains the basis for building Kosovo's future.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes progress made in the formation of the executive bodies of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to include representatives of all communities. It commends the efforts of the Special Representative and welcomes the priorities outlined in the Secretary-General's report, as well as his request to develop benchmarks to measure progress in Kosovo's institutional development, consistent with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the Constitutional Framework. The Council encourages the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, in full cooperation with the Special Representative and in strict compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, to take on the tasks assigned to them by the Constitutional Framework.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms the fundamental importance of the rule of law in the political development of Kosovo. It strongly condemns attacks against UNMIK police in Mitrovica on 8 April and calls on all communities fully to respect UNMIK authority throughout Kosovo in line with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. It supports the continuing efforts of UNMIK and KFOR, together with the Kosovo Police Service, in combating all kinds of crime, violence and extremism. It supports all efforts to control borders and boundaries, thus fostering regional stability. The Council supports and encourages further efforts to facilitate return of all displaced persons from the Kosovo Serb and other communities. Interlocking progress in the areas of public security, political development and economic reform and reconstruction contributes to sustainable returns and requires maximum support from Member States and regional organizations. The Council calls on the leaders of the  Provisional Institutions of Self-Government actively to demonstrate their commitment and support efforts to promote security, returns, human rights, economic development, and a multi-ethnic and fair society with peaceful coexistence and freedom of movement for all the population of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the decision of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to transfer Kosovo Albanian prisoners into the custody of UNMIK, and encourages further progress regarding the return of displaced persons to Kosovo and efforts to trace those still missing from all of Kosovo's communities, as well as the other issues identified in the Common Document for cooperation between UNMIK and the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia signed on 5 November 2001. It considers that the further development of dialogue and cooperation between the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, UNMIK and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities is vital to the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-11.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/11</a>.</p>
