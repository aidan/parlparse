	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">As members will recall, when the 44th plenary meeting was adjourned on Tuesday morning, 31 October 2006, there still remained one seat from among the Latin American and Caribbean States to be filled.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Before proceeding further, I would like to inform members that I have received a letter dated 3 November 2006 from the Chairman of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States informing the Assembly that, after the withdrawal of Guatemala and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as candidates to the Security Council for the period 2007-2008, the Group has endorsed the candidature of Panama.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the next round of balloting by secret ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">This forty-eighth round of balloting, will, in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, also be the twenty-third unrestricted ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">For this forty-eighth round of balloting, may I remind the Assembly that any Member State from among the Latin American and Caribbean States may be a candidate except those outgoing members and those already members of the Security Council, namely Argentina and Peru.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa07">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">I am delighted that the General Assembly has just elected Panama, starting from 1 January 2007, as the second non-permanent member of the Security Council from among the Latin American and Caribbean Group of States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa03">On this occasion, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to Panama on its election and wish it every success in the discharge of this important mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa04">Allow me also to commend the Latin American and Caribbean Group of States for the spirit of compromise and solidarity they have shown throughout this process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa05">In this context, I would like to express my sincerest appreciation to both Guatemala and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for their joint decision to work closely with other members of the Group in order to reach consensus on a compromise candidate.

	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">Madam President, thank you for allowing me to take the floor on this occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">My delegation wishes to use this opportunity to reiterate its gratitude to your Government in particular and to each of the 116 countries that have supported us at this time in our aspiration to fill the non-permanent member vacancy traditionally filled by a member of the Latin American and Caribbean Group in the Security Council during the 2007-2008 biennium. Our special recognition goes to our Mesoamerican partners, the countries of Central America, Colombia and Mexico.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">We also wish to thank all the members of the General Assembly for their patience, as well as for the respect shown through this electoral process that concludes today.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">To the Government and people of Panama, we extend our heartfelt congratulations for their selection by the Latin American and Caribbean Group, on the initiative of Guatemala and Venezuela, to be proposed to the General Assembly as the consensus candidate to represent our region in the Security Council during the 2007-2008 biennium. We feel well-represented by Panama, a brotherly country and member of the Central American Integration System.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">Although we regret the polarization of the campaign by reasons that had nothing to do with our own conduct, we are proud of the fact that Guatemala could carry out a systematic and professional campaign, well planned, and, above all, with dignity, respect and collegiality, that was worthy of the endorsement of as many as 116 of the countries Members of this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">At all times, Guatemala has defended the principles and purposes enshrined in the United Nations Charter, especially with regard to the friendly relations among States, equitable geographical rotation and participation of small States in the various United Nations bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">Guatemala has waited for the opportunity to participate in the Security Council for more than 60 years. We have more than sufficient merit to serve on that body, and this is why my Government has duly presented to our regional Group its candidacy for the vacancy that will come up for the 2012-2013 biennium. It is our hope that on that occasion the countries of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States will give us their support.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias Cárdenas</span> <span class="nation">Venezuela</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">On behalf of the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías, and on behalf of our people, we would like to thank all United Nations representatives. We would like to thank you, Madam President, and the General Assembly for its support and understanding.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">We made a proposal -- a very frank proposal of our own -- to provide the Security Council with a balanced and independent voice. The election was quite unique; it was more than a campaign between two brotherly countries within one region where there was no consensus. Various statements were made in this very Hall. Afterwards, the Ambassador of the United States claimed that this had been a triumph for his country, for the United States, and that it had achieved its objective, namely to ensure that a developing country such as ours did not achieve a seat on the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">We could deny this or draw other conclusions from this, but we would prefer not to do so. We would prefer to say that we would not like to speak of defeat or the defeated. But there must be lessons learned from these 46 rounds of balloting in the General Assembly. For the big countries, it should be clear that they cannot impose their will and that the Assembly will not accept imposition, because it exercises its freedom in democracy. We should also remember that some embraces end up by killing you, like a bear hug; and everyone should remember the strength and power of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Finally, we must learn the strength of dialogue. In looking at the proposal that the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States (GRULAC) has put forward to the General Assembly -- the proposal of Panama -- which is a bridge between Central America and South America -- a country that was part of the great liberator Simon Bolívar's big homeland, Greater Colombia, we hope that country will move forward, be independent, impartial and balanced within the Security Council. Of course, as a nation with a vision, we will be prepared to support them in every way possible.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk07-pa01">Upon instructions from my Government, I wish to make the following statement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk07-pa02">The Republic of Bulgaria submitted its candidature for membership of the United Nations Economic and Social Council guided by the will to contribute in good faith to effective partnership and cooperation among United Nations Member States in the economic and social field. My country gave ample proof of its commitment to the Economic and Social Council during its several previous terms on the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk07-pa03">At the time of the elections for new members of the Economic and Social Council held on 2 November 2006, there were clear indications of wide support among Member States for the Bulgarian candidature. However, although in the first round Bulgaria received 123 votes -- five votes short of the required two-thirds majority -- we have taken note of the fact that our bid to serve on the Economic and Social Council for the period 2007-2009 did not receive the support of the required majority of Member States. Acting in a spirit of goodwill and cooperation, Bulgaria has therefore decided to withdraw its candidature and to postpone it to a later time.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk07-pa04">My country remains committed to the goals of the Economic and Social Council and stands ready to contribute in every possible way to streamlining the work of that main United Nations body.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk07-pa05">I would like to express our deep and sincere gratitude to all the countries that have given us their unwavering support throughout the election campaign.</p>
