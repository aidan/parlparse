I am sure I speak for all members of the Security Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Keating for the great diplomatic skill, even-handedness, fair-mindedness and unfailing courtesy with which he conducted the Council's business last month.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on improving the capacity of the United Nations for peace-keeping, <a href="../pdf/S-26450.pdf" class="nolink">document S/26450</a> and Add.1 and <a href="../pdf/S-26450-Corr.1.pdf" class="nolink">Corr.1</a> and Add. 2.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;Aware of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the Security Council has begun its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General entitled 'Improving the capacity of the United Nations for peace-keeping' of 14 March 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-26450.pdf" class="nolink">S/26450</a>). The Security Council welcomes the useful account the report provides of the measures the Secretary-General has taken to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to undertake peace-keeping operations. The Security Council notes that this report follows the report of the Secretary-General entitled 'An Agenda for Peace' (<a href="../pdf/S-24111.pdf" class="nolink">S/24111</a>) and that it responds to the statements made by successive Presidents of the Security Council on 'An Agenda for Peace', including in particular the statement made by the President of the Security Council on 28 May 1993 (<a href="../pdf/S-25859.pdf" class="nolink">S/25859</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council notes that the report 'Improving the capacity of the United Nations for peace-keeping' has been transmitted to the General Assembly and also notes that the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations has made recommendations on the report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">Establishment of Peace-keeping Operations</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Security Council recalls that the statement made by its President on 28 May 1993 (<a href="../pdf/S-25859.pdf" class="nolink">S/25859</a>) stated, inter alia, that United Nations peace-keeping operations should be conducted in accordance with a number of operational principles, consistent with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. In that context, the Security Council is conscious of the need for the political goals, mandate, costs, and, where possible, the estimated time-frame of United Nations peace-keeping operations to be clear and precise, and of the requirement for the mandates of peace-keeping operations to be subject to periodic review. The Council will respond to situations on a case-by-case basis. Without prejudice to its ability to do so and to respond rapidly and flexibly as circumstances require, the Council considers that the following factors, among others, should be taken into account when the establishment of new peace-keeping operations is under consideration:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;- whether a situation exists the continuation of which is likely to endanger or constitute a threat to international peace and security;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;- whether regional or subregional organizations and arrangements exist and are ready and able to assist in resolving the situation;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">&quot;- whether a cease-fire exists and whether the parties have committed themselves to a peace process intended to reach a political settlement;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">&quot;- whether a clear political goal exists and whether it can be reflected in the mandate;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">&quot;- whether a precise mandate for a United Nations operation can be formulated;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">&quot;- whether the safety and security of United Nations personnel can be reasonably ensured, including in particular whether reasonable guarantees can be obtained from the principal parties or factions regarding the safety and security of United Nations personnel; in this regard it reaffirms its statement of 31 March 1993 (<a href="../pdf/S-25493.pdf" class="nolink">S/25493</a>) and its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-868(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 868 (1993)</a> of 29 September 1993.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">&quot;The Security Council should also be provided with an estimate of projected costs for the start-up phase (initial 90 days) of the operation and the first six months, as well as for the resulting increase in total projected annualized United Nations peace-keeping expenditures, and should be informed of the likely availability of resources for the new operation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">&quot;The Security Council emphasizes the need for the full cooperation of the parties concerned in implementing the mandates of peace-keeping operations as well as relevant decisions of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">&quot;Onqoinq Review of Operations</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">&quot;The Security Council notes that the increasing number and complexity of peace-keeping operations, and of situations likely to give rise to proposals for peace-keeping operations, may require measures to improve the quality and speed of the flow of information available to support Council decision-making. The Security Council will keep this question under consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa19">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the enhanced efforts made by the Secretariat to provide information to the Council and underlines the importance of further improving the briefing for Council members on matters of special concern.</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk07-pa20">&quot;Communication with Non-Members of the Security Council (including Troop Contributors)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa21">&quot;The Security Council recognizes the implications which its decisions on peace-keeping operations have for the Members of the United Nations and in particular for troop-contributing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa22">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the increased communication between members and non-members of the Council and believes that the practice of monthly consultations between the President of the Security Council and competent groups of Member States on the Council's programme of work (which includes matters relating to peace-keeping operations) should be continued.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa23">&quot;The Security Council is conscious of the need for enhanced consultations and exchange of information with troop- contributing countries regarding peace-keeping operations, including their planning, management and coordination, particularly when significant extensions in an operation's mandate are in prospect. Such consultations can take a variety of forms involving Member States, troop-contributing countries, members of the Security Council and the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa24">&quot;The Security Council believes that when major events occur regarding peace-keeping operations, including decisions to change or extend a mandate, there is a particular need for members of the Council to seek to exchange views with troop contributors, including by way of informal communications between the Council's President or its members and troop contributors.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa25">&quot;The recent practice of the Secretariat of convening meetings of troop contributors, in the presence, as appropriate, of Council members, is welcome and should be developed. The Council also encourages the Secretariat to convene regular meetings for troop contributors and Council members to hear reports from Special Representatives of the Secretary-General or Force Commanders and, as appropriate, to make situation reports on peace-keeping operations available at frequent and regular intervals.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa26">&quot;The Security Council will keep under review arrangements for communication with non-members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa27">&quot;Stand-by Arranqements</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa28">&quot;The Security Council attaches great importance to improving the capacity of the United Nations to meet the need for rapid deployment and reinforcement of peace-keeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa29">&quot;In this context the Security Council welcomes the recommendations in the Secretary-General's report of 14 March 1994 concerning stand-by arrangements and capabilities. The Security Council notes the intention of the Secretary-General to devise stand-by arrangements or capabilities which Member States could maintain at an agreed state of readiness as a possible contribution to a United Nations peace-keeping operation and welcomes the commitments undertaken by a number of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa30">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the request by the Secretary-General to Member States to respond positively to this initiative and encourages Member States to do so in so far as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa31">&quot;The Security Council encourages the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to include civilian personnel, such as police, in the present stand-by arrangements planning initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa32">&quot;The Security Council also encourages the Secretary-General to ensure that the Stand-by Arrangements Management Unit carry on its work, including the periodic updating of the list of units and resources.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa33">&quot;The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to report by 30 June 1994 and thereafter at least once a year on progress with this initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa34">&quot;The Council will keep this matter under review in order to make recommendations or take decisions required in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa35">&quot;Civilian Personnel</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa36">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the observations made by the Secretary-General in his report in respect of civilian personnel, including civilian police, and invites Member States to respond positively to requests to contribute such personnel to United Nations peace-keeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa37">&quot;The Security Council attaches importance to full coordination between the different components, military and civilian, of a peace-keeping operation, particularly a multifaceted one. This coordination should extend throughout the planning and implementation of the operation, both at United Nations Headquarters and in the field.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa38">&quot;Traininq</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa39">&quot;The Security Council recognizes that the training of personnel for peace-keeping operations is essentially the responsibility of Member States, but encourages the Secretariat to continue the development of basic guidelines and performance standards and to provide descriptive materials.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa40">&quot;The Security Council notes the recommendations of the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations on training of peace-keeping personnel. It invites Member States to cooperate with each other in the provision of facilities for this purpose.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa41">&quot;Command and Control</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa42">&quot;The Security Council stresses that as a leading principle United Nations peace-keeping operations should be under the operational control of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa43">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the call by the General Assembly (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-43.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 48/43</a>) that the Secretary-General, in cooperation with the members of the Security Council, troopcontributing States and other interested Member States, take urgent action on the question of command and control, notes the comments of the Secretary-General in his report of 14 March 1994 and looks forward to his further report on the matter.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa44">&quot;Financial and Administrative Issues</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa45">&quot;Bearing in mind the responsibilities of the General Assembly under Article 17 of the Charter, the Security Council notes the Secretary-General's observations and recommendations on budgetary matters relating to peace-keeping operations in his report of 14 March 1994 and notes also that his report has been referred to the General Assembly for its consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa46">&quot;The Security Council confirms that estimates of the financial implications of peace-keeping operations are required from the Secretariat before decisions on mandates or extensions are taken so that the Council is able to act in a financially responsible way.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa47">&quot;Conclusion</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa48">&quot;The Security Council will give further consideration to the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa49">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-22.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/22</a>.</p>
