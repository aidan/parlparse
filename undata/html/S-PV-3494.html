	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">The first speaker is His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique. On behalf of the Security Council, I welcome him and invite him to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Simão</span> <span class="nation">Mozambique</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">First of all, I wish to congratulate you most warmly, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the current month. I have been advised of your excellent qualities of leadership as well as your diplomatic skills. I therefore have no doubt that you will successfully guide our deliberations. You can rest assured of my delegation's readiness to cooperate with you in the discharge of your duties. I would request you to convey to the Government of Argentina the Mozambican Government's appreciation for the positive role your country has played in the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), and especially for the military hospital deployed by Argentina in our country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I should also like to commend the manner in which your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Manzi Bakuramutsa of Rwanda, presided over the deliberations of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I wish to seize this opportunity to welcome the new members of the Council -- Botswana, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia and Italy. My delegation looks forward to cooperating closely with them during the period of their mandate. I should not fail to put on record my Government's appreciation for the excellent role played by the outgoing members of the Council -- Brazil, Djibouti, New Zealand, Pakistan and Spain -- during the last two years as members of the Security Council. Their participation, together with that of other members of the Council, and their close relationship with us during the last two years have contributed to enhancing the role of this body in addressing major issues concerning international peace and security. Indeed, it was during that period that the Council dealt with matters pertaining to the establishment of lasting peace and tranquillity in my country, in the framework of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). In that period, members of the Council contributed collectively and individually to the success of the noble cause of peace in Mozambique. May I, at this stage, commend all Security Council members and their respective Governments for the valuable contribution they have rendered to my country ever since the signing of the General Peace Agreement in Rome on 4 October 1992.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">On behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, I should equally like to commend the Secretary-General for the personal role he has played in the consolidation of peace in my country, as well as in the maintenance of international peace and security. In our assessment, despite the numerous challenges facing today's world, the Secretary-General has been able to make the United Nations an organization respected by all of us and regarded as an instrument of hope for the peoples of the world. In the case of Mozambique, the Secretary-General's permanent follow-up and leadership of ONUMOZ activities has played a crucial role in the implementation of the General Peace Agreement. His visit to Mozambique in October last year bears testimony to his personal commitment towards our peace process. Similarly, I wish to commend the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Aldo Ajello, and the personnel of ONUMOZ for their efforts to implement the mandate entrusted to them. I recall with deep sadness that some of those young men have lost their lives in the discharge of their duties. Once again, on behalf of the people and the Government of Mozambique and on my own behalf, I wish to pay tribute to them and reiterate our heartfelt condolences to their respective Governments and families.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Today's meeting is the last of a series of Security Council meetings on Mozambique during the past two years. We are honoured to participate in today's deliberations, especially because we are assembled not to express our concerns over outstanding issues but, rather, to say that at last our collective mission has been successfully accomplished, despite all the hurdles we encountered in the process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">We are therefore happy to congratulate ourselves on the completion of a major, delicate but successful United Nations peace-keeping operation. It is now time for a final assessment of the whole process, so as to draw lessons that will certainly help the United Nations address similar operations in future and to collectively exchange views on the United Nations Operation in Mozambique and on how best we can enhance the role of the United Nations in peace-keeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">In a few days, in pursuance of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-957(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 957 (1994)</a> of 14 November 1994, the United Nations Operation in Mozambique will have completed all its activities and withdrawn from Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">As the Council is aware, in fulfilment of the provisions of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique, the first multi-party general elections were held from 27 to 29 October 1994. These elections have been regarded by the international community and by this body as an example of the political maturity of the Mozambican people. We take great pride in the distinction thus conferred on our people. It gives us renewed energy and the confidence to overcome future challenges. My Government recognizes the significant role played by the Security Council in the success of these first general elections in my country and regards them as the real foundation for the establishment of a multi-party democratic society in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">At the completion of this process, a new Assembly of the Republic, consisting of 250 deputies from the three political parties that obtained the most votes, was inaugurated on 8 December. Subsequently -- on the following day -- President Chissano was sworn in as the first President elected by universal suffrage.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">These very important steps marked the beginning of a new era in the history of Mozambique. This is an era in which political pluralism, national reconciliation and peaceful coexistence between Mozambicans will have to be ensured in order to enable lasting peace to be attained in our country. Indeed, it is within the framework of multi-party democracy that a presidential forum, composed of a variety of distinguished political figures, will be created to enhance the national reconciliation process and the consolidation of democracy. We are entering an era in which violence and the use or threat of the use of force will be replaced by political dialogue and tolerance; an era in which the right to agree or disagree with one another must be respected by each and every person.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">In other words, this is an era in which respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms will constitute the cornerstone of our society. In his inaugural address, President Chissano committed himself to doing all in his power to attain these objectives, so that the peace we celebrate today may endure for ever. He further emphasized, <i>inter alia</i>, that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk08-pa12">"As I begin my mandate as President of the Republic, I declare my solemn commitment that I shall always be the President of all Mozambicans. I shall guarantee to all Mozambicans equal rights and freedoms, enshrined in the Constitution and in law. I shall respect the will of the majority and shall pay due attention to the rights of minorities in order that the enjoyment of freedom and rights shall never again be restricted or threatened by intolerance, discrimination or acts of aggression".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">In summary, we have entered an era in which Mozambicans will learn to live together in harmony and will concentrate their efforts on healing the wounds resulting from so many years of conflict and destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">As we begin this new phase in our democratic process, we look forward to addressing the challenges ahead of us. Currently, the Government is engaged in the preparation of the budget, whose approval by the Assembly of the Republic is scheduled to take place in March. To this end, President Chissano, in his annual address to the diplomatic community accredited in Mozambique, launched an appeal to the donor community for its continued involvement in the process of national reconstruction. He further stressed his conviction that the implementation of the Economic and Social Rehabilitation Programme launched by the Government in 1987, having shown encouraging trends and significant progress during the last year, can register even better results now that our country is enjoying a climate of peace, provided it is supported by the international community. We sincerely hope that the forthcoming Consultative Group meeting, scheduled for March in Paris, will be in line with the expectations of our people by responding positively to the country's needs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">My Government attaches great importance to the promotion of the wider involvement of both the national and the foreign private sectors in the implementation of undertakings that can generate employment and contribute to the solution of the economic and social problems facing us today. In this connection, the Government has recently carried out a thorough review of the legislation on foreign investment, so as to simplify the legal proceedings in order to provide substantial incentives for foreign investment. In addition, my Government will continue to require international assistance in addressing vital issues pertaining to the reintegration of demobilized soldiers, returnees and displaced persons, as well as in taking actions aimed at eradicating poverty. These initiatives must be complemented by other actions aimed at promoting rural development and restoring primary health-care services in both urban and rural areas.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">The ongoing de-mining programme will play an important role in the fulfilment of the Government's priorities in the years to come. If we are to consolidate the normalization of life in rural areas, increase food production and facilitate the movement of people and goods throughout the country, it is essential that the issue of land mines be addressed with high resolve. In this connection, I wish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all those who have assisted and continue to assist my Government in carrying out this very important initiative. I had a very positive talk on this issue this morning with Mr. Peter Hansen, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">Those are, in summary, some of my Government's priorities. However, in order to maintain and further strengthen a truly democratic society, whose foundations have been established as a result of our recently held general elections, it is essential to ensure the adequate functioning of democratic institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">Accordingly, my Government regards it as of great importance to strengthen national institutions responsible for the maintenance of peace, tranquility and public order in our country as well as to ensure that the road on which we have just embarked is not blocked owing to lack of means. I have in mind the issue of the formation of the Mozambican Defence Force (FADM) -- an issue which is yet to be fully addressed -- and the strengthening of the role of the national police in ensuring, and its capacity to ensure, public safety. Moreover, we are determined to strengthen the judicial system so as to consolidate a real state of law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">The consolidation of the judicial system has been recognized as one of the most important elements in ensuring and guaranteeing the existence of true democracy in a country like ours -- and I believe, in all developing countries -- and in ensuring a system of checks and balances as well as transparency and accountability in the management of national affairs. Furthermore, there is general consensus that if we are to ensure true democracy in Mozambique, then we must create and consolidate a permanent electoral body which can guarantee the adequate supervision and monitoring of future elections. This should be an institution that is respected for its professionalism and transparency, and that thereby enjoys the necessary support of all political parties inside the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">Those are some of the main areas where we believe the support of the Security Council is crucial. In this connection, my Government very greatly appreciates the assurances given by the Secretary-General in his recent letter to my predecessor -- now Prime Minister -- His Excellency Mr. Pascoal Manuel Mocumbi, in which the Secretary-General indicated that despite the withdrawal of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), the United Nations will continue to assist Mozambique in strengthening the national reconstruction process and its new democratic institutions, as well as in its economic and social integration. We in Mozambique look forward to actively participating in and contributing to the materialization of these assurances.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">I should like to seize this opportunity, as I speak today on the subject of economic and social integration, to draw the Council's attention to the growing concern over a possible threat to our fragile peace that might result from the consequences of a new and renewed drought in Mozambique and in the southern African region as whole.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa22">My Government appreciates most sincerely the roles which the Security Council and the international community as a whole have played in helping us mitigate the devastating consequences of man-made and natural calamities which have ravaged our region. Nevertheless, I do believe it is my duty to encourage the Council to keep this issue under permanent review. As a matter of fact, human lives have already been lost in Mozambique as a result of the drought that is afflicting an ever-greater number of areas of my country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa23">For those reasons, my Government believes that the holding of the first multi-party general elections and the withdrawal of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique should not be regarded as ends in themselves. They are only the culmination of an important phase of the whole peace process and the beginning of a new and more challenging one. In our opinion, the need for the international community to continue to assist the people and the Government of Mozambique in consolidating peace and stability is more acute than ever before.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa24">The presence of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique offers me an excellent opportunity to refer briefly to the overall issue of peace-keeping operations. Our vision -- and, I am certain, that of many others among us today -- is that peace-keeping forces will be successful only if they enjoy the support of the parties involved. On the other hand, they must strictly adhere to fundamental principles outlined by the General Assembly and respect their respective terms of reference as approved by the Security Council and in line with the agreement reached by the parties. In particular, as my predecessor argued in his statement to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk08-pa25">"Where there is a Government, even with weak institutions, peace-keeping missions should work in close cooperation ... with the local authorities and respect and strengthen those institutions, rather than try to weaken or undermine them." <i>(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 15th meeting, p. 37)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa26">Those observations remain valid today. I believe it is important to underline them because, as the Secretary-General indicated in his "Agenda for Peace", the State is and must remain the foundation-stone of the work of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa27">In the case of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique, we congratulate ourselves on its excellent and smooth communication with the Secretary-General and his Special Representative during the whole process. The existence of adequate communication is vital for the success of peace-keeping operations, for it helps to solve problems and crises as they arise. Above all, communication helps to restore confidence between the United Nations and the parties whenever necessary. To this end, may I recall the Secretary-General's visits to Mozambique at a time when the whole peace process seemed to be deadlocked, and of the Security Council's Mission at a time when it appeared unclear to the international community whether elections would be held as scheduled. Thanks to communication, we were able to resolve all difficulties and to bring the peace process to the successful conclusion we all celebrate today.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa28">The consolidation of peace in Mozambique constitutes a significant contribution to peace in the southern African region, where we witnessed in 1994 significant developments in many of its countries. The holding of multi-party general elections in a number of countries of the region has been the central element of the ongoing democratic transformation we are experiencing.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa29">The recent signing of the Lusaka Protocol between the Government of the Republic of Angola and UNITA constitutes a significant contribution to efforts for peace in our region. We sincerely wish to encourage both parties to take maximum advantage of the momentum created in Lusaka and to work together for a better future in their country. May I take this opportunity to underline the importance we attach to the early deployment of the third United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III). Our recent experience in this regard has shown that the sooner such a verification mechanism is established and deployed, the better for the success of the peace process. I would therefore urge the Council to look into this matter more diligently and expeditiously.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa30">These developments lead us to believe in lasting peace and security in Mozambique and in southern Africa as a whole. My Government wishes to encourage all members of the Council to work towards this objective.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I thank the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Legwaila</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">I have the special honour and privilege to speak on behalf of the 11 States members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC): Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and my own country, Botswana.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Let me first extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of Mozambique. It is fitting that we should be graced by his presence in this historic Chamber as we celebrate the momentous changes that have taken place in his great country.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">It is with immense joy that we salute the people of Mozambique and all their political leaders for doing what is right for their country. We salute their determination and strong commitment to fostering national reconciliation, peace and democracy. We especially admire their tenacious adherence to the General Peace Agreement signed on 4 October 1992, the orderly manner in which they conducted the elections and the respect they so clearly demonstrated for the verdict of the people of Mozambique. This has given Mozambique the best hope for durable freedom, democracy and peace. We have every confidence that the newly elected leadership will rise to the challenge and put the country on a firm footing in the furtherance of the aspirations reposed in them by the electorate.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The success story of Mozambique cannot be told without acknowledging the pivotal role played by the United Nations and the international community as a whole. The patience and goodwill so amply demonstrated by the Security Council over a period of two difficult years have enabled the people of Mozambique to sustain the peace process to its logical conclusion. The 10 resolutions adopted by the Council, as well as all presidential statements issued subsequent to the signing of the General Peace Agreement, contributed in no small measure to the success of the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">We also owe a debt of gratitude to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Ajello, for the tireless efforts they deployed to ensure that the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) would achieve the glorious success it has achieved. The devotion and sacrifices of the men and women who served with ONUMOZ deserve our special appreciation and applause. The ONUMOZ success story is the story of the productive quality of their professionalism, which has crowned the United Nations peacemaking and peace-keeping exertions with success stories elsewhere.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">The recurring theme of post-conflict peace-building -- that there is an inexorable link between peace and development -- has great significance and relevance for Mozambique. The daunting task of reconstruction and rehabilitation in Mozambique has begun. A durable basis for peace and security in that war-ravaged country lies in the social and economic uplifting of its people; and the international community is called upon to assist. The end of the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) and its complete withdrawal should not signal the end of this assistance. Continuous support should be given for social and economic development to ensure that there is no reversal of the gains made so far.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">The response of the international community to the reintegration support scheme has so far been positive, and we hope that the momentum can be maintained, even accelerated. There is clearly an urgent need for enhanced cooperation with the Mozambican authorities in the reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life. We trust that existing pledges of assistance will be honoured so that the Government can commence in earnest the process of training and equipping these men and women with technical skills for alternative employment.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">In addition, as in many other areas recovering from the vicissitudes of armed conflict, the territory of Mozambique is littered with anti-personnel land mines. The idea that the mine-clearing equipment currently in use in Mozambique should be left behind when ONUMOZ finally withdraws is most welcome, and we hope that it will find favour with the relevant organs of the United Nations. Land mines, as we all know, are a menace to humanity. Mozambique needs to be rid of these indiscriminate tools of war so that its people can go about their daily lives and enjoy their new-found democratic rights in total freedom.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">The leaders of southern Africa are working very hard to ensure that our region is not subjected to another war, or wars, after the resolution of conflicts in Mozambique, South Africa and Angola. The attainment of peace and democracy in Mozambique has consolidated the fundamental political changes which have swept the subregion in the past five years. It is our hope that the people of the sister Republic of Angola will soon see the end of the conflict that has marred their lives for so long and will join the people of Mozambique in celebrating the onset of real peace.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa10">In this regard, we humbly request the Security Council to take a decision for the early deployment of a third United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III). The countries of southern Africa have had more than their share of conflict and suffering. It is time we enjoyed peace and democracy so that we can reconstruct our regional economy.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa11">The solidarity and partnership of the peoples of the 11 members States of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in the pursuit of peace and development is clearly recognized. Collective and individual efforts exerted by the various member States in the search for peace in Angola, Mozambique, Lesotho and South Africa bear clear testimony to this solidarity and partnership. We are now in the process of developing permanent mechanisms for preventive diplomacy and collective security based on a regional commitment to a system of shared democratic values.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa12">Let me conclude by daring to hope that peace and democracy will flourish in Mozambique and that the destructive conflict from which the Mozambican nation has just emerged will be banished for ever.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Graf zu Rantzau</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">My Government is very pleased that we have this occasion to discuss in the Security Council the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) a few days before it successfully completes its mission. I especially welcome the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, on this occasion. I listened attentively to the very impressive statement he made before the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Only two years after the General Peace Agreement was signed on 4 October 1992, its main goals have been achieved: a cease-fire, the dissolution and disarmament of the Government and RENAMO troops, the establishment of a joint defence force, the repatriation and reintegration of approximately 5 million refugees and internally displaced persons, and the holding of the first general presidential and parliamentary elections.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Even if the original time-frame turned out to be too ambitious and had to be changed, in the end a number of factors were decisive for the success of ONUMOZ. The most important prerequisite for the success of the peace process was the desire for peace on both sides. A continuation of the civil war, which could not have been won by military efforts, would have further devastated an already exhausted country. Both parties to the conflict realized this.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">Even the most favourable circumstances, however, cannot prevent the development of crisis situations that threaten to derail the peace process. Tribute is due the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Aldo Ajello, for his tireless efforts to find creative solutions to the various unexpected difficulties along the way.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">We would further like to mention the Supervisory and Monitoring Commission, whose task was to guarantee the implementation of the Peace Agreement and compliance with the timetable and with the cease-fire. The active role played in the Commission by its international members, jointly with the representative of the United Nations, has turned it into an effective instrument to further the peace process. We should think about including similar mechanisms in future peace-keeping missions as well.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">An important prerequisite for the implementation of the Rome Agreement was the establishment of the United Nations Trust Fund to provide logistical support. Its significance cannot be overestimated, since it enabled the opposition to participate in the peace process on an equal economic footing.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Even a success story may include some lessons to be learned. I want to mention just a few.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Peace-keeping operations will be even more successful when they embrace the principle of lean management. This holds true not only for Headquarters but also for the individual operations on site. Efficient management includes transparency and cost-effectiveness in the handling of tender offers.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">The Mozambican experience demonstrates the importance of guaranteeing freedom of movement in the country for civilians and returnees from the very start of the mission. In order to ensure this, the mission should be capable of executing police tasks from the outset. The verification of the disarmament of conflicting parties should be concluded by the end of the mandate of a peace-keeping operation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">After almost 20 years of turmoil and suffering, the people of Mozambique now have the chance to build a better future for themselves. No one expects the road ahead to be easy. The weapons arsenals of both former conflicting parties, arsenals that still exist in Mozambique, remain a cause for concern. The reconstruction of democratic institutions will continue to require political and material support from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">Considering all that has been achieved in the last two years, however, we feel that we have reason to be optimistic about the future of Mozambique. I would therefore request Minister Simão to assure his people of our continued solidarity.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">Finally, I want to associate myself fully with what will be said by the Permanent Representative of France on behalf of the European Union.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">It is a great pleasure for me to welcome the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Simão, and to thank him for his important and interesting statement to the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">We sincerely congratulate the people and the leaders of Mozambique on the successful holding of the first multi-party elections in the history of that country and the creation of a democratic coalition Government. This important event is a worthy culmination of Mozambique's progress along the difficult road to peace and consent and has marked the end of a lengthy period of destructive internecine conflict that brought untold suffering to the people of that country. The Russian Federation actively promoted the peace process in Mozambique and wishes the people and the Government of that friendly country, to which we are solidly linked by many years of fruitful cooperation, further success in creating a stable, democratic and flourishing State.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">The successful implementation of the large-scale and complex task of effecting a political settlement in Mozambique was made possible by the consistent support of the international community and the staunch resolve of the Mozambicans themselves to break out of the vicious circle of violence and confrontation. An important and instructive role in this regard was played by President Chissano and the leaders of the Mozambican political parties, who, displaying a rare degree of political courage and statesmanlike wisdom and restraint, were able, for the sake of the higher interests of their country, to rise above the differences that had separated them for years and embark on the course of national reconciliation. We are convinced that this approach is the most reliable guarantee of success in carrying out the difficult tasks of the post-conflict stage in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">We would also like to express our gratitude to the personnel of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ajello, for their skilful and determined efforts to bring the peace process in Mozambique to success. This became an important component in the consolidation of stability and security in the southern African region as a whole. The success of the complex and large-scale Operation in Mozambique is one of the most impressive examples of the real capacities of the United Nations in the field of peace-making.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">During the three-year mandate of ONUMOZ, a great deal of meaningful and useful experience has been gained, which we believe deserves thorough study in order to further enhance the effectiveness of United Nations peace-keeping operations. In this connection, we look forward to the presentation of the Secretary-General's report containing an analysis of the lessons learned from the United Nations Operation in Mozambique. We are quite certain it will be an important contribution to our future work.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fulci</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I wish to join you, Mr. President, and the speakers who preceded me in extending a warm welcome to the Foreign Minister of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Simão. His presence at this table today symbolizes the return of his country to peace, unity, stability and progress. Henceforth Mozambique will be able to channel all its energies into healing the wounds of a protracted civil war and building a better future for all its people in a renewed spirit of harmony, respect and understanding. May I ask him to convey our congratulations to the leader of his country, President Chissano, who, together with the leader of RENAMO, Mr. Dhlakama, decided to set out on a path of dialogue and pacification by signing the historic General Peace Agreement, in Rome, on 4 October 1992, under the auspices of the Italian Government and the community of Saint Egidius. This process culminated a few months ago in the free and peaceful election of the President and the Parliament of Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">I fully associate myself in advance with the statement of the Permanent Representative of France, who will speak on behalf of the European Union. I do not have much to add, but I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to recall, not without some pride, Italy's special commitment to ending the civil war that divided Mozambique for almost 20 years.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">The United Nations peace-keeping Operation in Mozambique marks a milestone in the history of our Organization's peace-keeping activities. This Operation is already often being cited as one of the true success stories of the United Nations in the application of the pertinent provisions of the Charter, which the founding fathers conceived of as a way to end the tensions and conflicts that have marked the history of this century. The Italian people, our Parliament and our Government are deeply gratified by the outcome of the process begun in Rome two years ago, and we are proud to have had a role in making it possible. Of course, it was a long, extremely difficult and complex negotiation, and sincere homage must be paid to both parties -- the Government and RENAMO -- and to all those who contributed to the final success through their tenacity, good faith and, above all, sincere willingness to compromise. Our colleague here at the United Nations, Ambassador Pedro Comissario Afonso, also lent a very skilful hand from New York, and we should acknowledge that.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">But good offices and mediation alone would not have sufficed; military and financial commitments were equally necessary. In this regard, allow me to cite only three figures concerning the Italian contribution to Mozambique. To monitor observance of the peace agreements, together with other United Nations troops, my country deployed in Mozambique a total of 4,700 men, 650 vehicles and 11 aircraft, a contribution amounting to roughly $300 million, only a fraction of which was reimbursed by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Equally significant were the voluntary contributions -- another $110 million -- through bilateral and multilateral channels; and this does not include additional bilateral economic assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">Of course, the elections were the key element in the peace process, and we must again congratulate the Mozambican Government and RENAMO on keeping to their agreement and making possible what many had considered impossible: fair, impartial and free elections, with an 88-per-cent participation rate by Mozambican voters.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">In the long term, some of the key aspects of ONUMOZ will represent a point of reference for other peace-keeping operations. A careful study of the presence and activity of the United Nations in Mozambique could contribute, we believe, to the deeper reflection currently under way on United Nations peace-keeping activities, in connection with the Secretary-General's recent important Supplement to the Agenda for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">We also should remember that individuals play a crucial role in operations of this type. The professionalism, experience, negotiating talent and personal qualities of those involved -- of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for instance -- often can mean the difference between success and failure. From this perspective, we must pay tribute once again to the political stature and leadership of the Mozambican leaders, and also to the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Aldo Ajello, and to all the on-site representatives of the donor countries, who operated at all times in close and effective coordination.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">We should never tire of reminding ourselves that peace and development go hand in hand. They are the two sides of the same coin: there can be no peace without development, and no development without peace. I am glad to assure the Foreign Minister that Italy intends to continue in Mozambique to play a role on the front line of this phase of consolidating democracy and stability, which are so closely linked to economic development. The seeds of democracy in Mozambique will take root, but they are still fragile and in need of care. The stabilization of political institutions, in the meantime, will constitute a vital premise for the economic and social development to which the country so rightly aspires.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">In this perspective, we believe that two fundamental conditions must be fulfilled. First, the international community must continue to maintain a high level of commitment to helping Mozambique, even when that country is no longer on the map of crisis areas. Secondly, a true policy of national reconciliation must continue to prevail in that country, one that would allow everybody to participate on an equal footing in its democratic life and institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">Let me conclude by wishing every success to Foreign Minister Simão and to the new, freely and democratically elected Government of Mozambique. It is our most sincere hope that the consolidation of freedom, democracy and development in Mozambique will set a shining example for other countries that, unfortunately, are still affected by civil war and internal strife.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ayewah</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I should like to begin by welcoming to the Council the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, and to thank him for his very important statement.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The Nigerian delegation is particularly delighted that Mozambique, a brotherly country, has succeeded in overcoming a very difficult phase of its history in its effort to build a virile and united political entity. In this major effort, Mozambique has chosen, after the trauma of over 30 years of internal strife and political instability, to pursue the logic of peace. We cannot but commend the courage and vision of the Mozambican leadership in pursuing national reconciliation in the higher interest of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) provides both a lesson in and an example of how to intervene in a conflict with the consent of the concerned parties and achieve the desired result. We commend the United Nations for this bold initiative and for sustaining it until a resolution of the problem was achieved. We hope that the model of this experience will be applied to other conflict areas in which the United Nations is involved. In evaluating the reasons for the overall success of this United Nations enterprise, we agree that a number of factors could be identified. However, one of the most salient, in our view, was the demonstrable interest and cooperation of the three observer States -- the United States, the Russian Federation and Portugal -- which, in conjunction with other members of the international community, generously invested their ideas and resources to make the peace process work.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">National reconciliation remains but an important first step in a country's political development after the trauma of a protracted conflict. Mozambique needs resources to develop structures that were battered during the long years of civil strife. In the aftermath of the war, national rehabilitation, reconstruction and de-mining have become urgent, requiring the assistance of the international community. It is in this connection that we commend the significant contributions already made by the United Kingdom and Italy, among others, to institution-building and to the development of civil society in Mozambique. We call for continued support by the international community, including the United Nations, donor agencies and non-governmental organizations, in this regard. Having invested so much effort in helping to end the conflict in Mozambique, we cannot fail to assist in sustaining the peace.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">In concluding, we wish to congratulate President Chissano on the dawn of a new era in Mozambique. We trust that the new Government will build on this achievement and consolidate the democratic process in the higher interest of national survival, well-being and development. The tasks ahead will by no means be easy, but we are confident that, together with the courageous people of Mozambique, it will undertake the journey ahead with determination and purpose. The Nigerian Government and people fully associate themselves with this expectation and would wish to assure the Government and people of Mozambique of their solidarity.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Khussaiby</span> <span class="nation">Oman</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">At the outset it gives me great pleasure to welcome His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Simão, the Foreign Minister of Mozambique, and to thank him for his important statement.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The Security Council meets today on a happy occasion to mark the official closure of the United Nations Observer Mission in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). The situation in Mozambique has been a cause for concern to the international community for two decades. The first multi-party elections in Mozambique, last October, were undoubtedly a high-water mark in the history of that country. On behalf of the Sultanate of Oman, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to warmly congratulate President Chissano, Prime Minister Mocumbi and the Government and all the people of Mozambique on this historic achievement.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">While we welcome the official closure of ONUMOZ, following the successful discharge of the mandate entrusted to it by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-797(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 797 (1992)</a>, we express the hope that the international community will continue to provide assistance to Mozambique in order to enable it to give due attention to economic and social reconstruction so that peace can be sustained.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">Although the status quo in Mozambique is a cause for optimism, the Mozambican parties should continue their commitment to abide by the principles stipulated in the General Peace Agreement. It is also imperative that all parties should be guided by the spirit of national reconciliation, which has now become the trend, and should work together in order to reconstruct their country.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">In conclusion, my delegation would like to congratulate the National Elections Commission on the excellent job done in arranging the overall democratic elections in Mozambique. We should also like to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General, the Security Council, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the international community, which has every right to be proud of its unrelenting support for the Mozambican peace process. The positive contribution of the Organization of African Unity to the efforts to establish a peaceful and durable solution to the conflict in Mozambique should not be overlooked.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir David Hannay</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I should like to begin by extending a very warm welcome to the Foreign Minister of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Simão. It is a great pleasure to see him here and to have had the opportunity to listen to his important and encouraging statement.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The holding of free and fair elections in Mozambique in October last year represented a historic achievement for the people of Mozambique and for the international community. We pay tribute to the people of Mozambique, whose will for peace overcame all the obstacles, and who exercised their right to vote in such impressive numbers and in such a responsible manner.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) has been a success of which the United Nations can be justly proud. Its peace-keepers, military observers and civilian police made a vital contribution to the sustaining of peace and security throughout the country as it made the difficult transition from civil war to multi-party democracy. The Electoral Division and the many international and national electoral observers contributed to the effectiveness and credibility of the electoral process. My Government warmly congratulates the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, Mr. Aldo Ajello, and the thousands of men and women who worked within the United Nations Operation in Mozambique on their skill and dedication. It is important that the lessons learned and the experience gained from ONUMOZ be put to good use in other United Nations peace-keeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">The United Kingdom is proud to have played its part in support of the peace process, including bilaterally through assisting in the formation and training of the new armed forces and the provision of electoral observers, and through the assistance offered by the European Union, about which the Permanent Representative of France, speaking later in this debate on behalf of the European Union, will say more. The United Kingdom will, to the best of its ability, continue to support the people of Mozambique in their efforts to reconstruct the economic and social base of their country.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The international community has done much to help the people of Mozambique over the last two years, and its assistance will not come to an end when ONUMOZ is terminated on 31 January. But it can only help. It cannot determine the future of Mozambique; only Mozambicans can do that. If they show the same spirit of national reconciliation as they amply demonstrated in the two years from the signing of the Rome Accords to the holding of the elections, then the future will be bright. We look to both the Government and the democratic Opposition in Mozambique to work closely together to this end. If they do so, they can be assured of the full backing of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">In conclusion, I would offer one New Year resolution to the new democratically elected Government of Mozambique -- namely, that never again should this Council have on its agenda, as we have today, an item entitled "The situation in Mozambique". That would indeed be an achievement for the Government and people of Mozambique and for this Council.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Li Zhaoxing</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I should like to warmly welcome His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Simão, Foreign Minister of Mozambique, to today's Council meeting and to thank him for delivering a very important statement.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">The Chinese and African peoples share identical or similar historical experiences. China has all along been following closely the developments in Africa. We deeply sympathize with the conflict-torn African continent in the post-cold-war era and with its people for the suffering caused by conflicts. It has been an important component of China's foreign policy to support the African people in their endeavour to achieve lasting peace and strengthen friendly relations of cooperation with all African other countries.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">His Excellency Mr. Qian Qichen, the Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister of China, is now visiting Africa. In his meetings with leaders of African States, he said that the disintegration of the bipolar world has made a huge impact on Africa, which greatly needs an environment of peace, unity and stability. China attaches importance to Africa and supports the just demands and reasonable stand of African countries in international affairs. This is just what we are doing at the United Nations, including the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">Mozambique has now set out on the road of consolidating peace, the road of economic rehabilitation and reconstruction, following the successful elections and the establishment of a new Government. The success in the Mozambican peace process has shown us that, even if there are numerous difficulties and hardships the conflicting parties can turn hostility into friendship and achieve the peace and stability to which the people ardently aspire, as long as, acting in their overall national interests, they have the necessary political will and persevere to achieve a political settlement through peaceful negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">The international community -- particularly the United Nations and donor countries -- has made tremendous efforts and put in enormous resources for the settlement of the conflict in Mozambique. China not only participated in the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), but also sent monitors to the elections in Mozambique. While engaged in in-depth discussions of the Secretary-General's "Supplement to an Agenda for Peace" (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-1.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/1</a>), people are summarizing the experience gained in ONUMOZ, which they hope will bring some inspiration and guidance to many other United Nations peace-keeping operations. In our view, the key to the success of ONUMOZ lies in the observance of the purposes and principles of the Charter and the adherence to the principles proven effective in traditional peace-keeping operations. That success was also dependent on the unswerving support of the international community, including that of the United Nations and the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">The Mozambican people are now faced with the arduous task of economic reconstruction, which calls for constant strong support from the international community. The Chinese Government and people will, as always, do whatever they can to help the Mozambican Government and people overcome the current difficulties and achieve economic and social development.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Inderfurth</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I should like to take this opportunity to welcome Foreign Minister Simão to the Security Council today. I should like to commend him for his excellent statement this afternoon and for the stress he placed on political pluralism, national reconciliation and multi-party democracy in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">This is an auspicious occasion. We mark the closing of one chapter in the history of Mozambique and the opening of another. The long-running conflict, and the United Nations peace-keeping operation it spawned, have drawn to a close. A new, democratic, cooperative future opens up before the Mozambicans, who have shown courage and fortitude in pursuing this new path.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">The peace-keeping operation in Mozambique was one of the largest and most successful in United Nations history. Its success was due to the combined efforts of the Mozambican people, the member States of the international community, and the men and women of the United Nations. Each of these -- from the most powerful to the least, from the leaders of Mozambique's political parties to the poorest citizen walking to a ballot box in the countryside, from senior officials in this grand building to the youngest private in a blue helmet who guarded a lonely road-crossing in the bush -- all can be proud of what their work together has accomplished.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Of course, no operation runs perfectly and there are important lessons to be learned from the United Nations experience in Mozambique. But the final result, ending years of bloodshed in a peaceful election, refutes the arguments of those who claim that United Nations peace-keeping is a needless expenditure of money and blood with nothing to show for it. The United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) demonstrates that, with commitment and determination, peace-keeping can work, assisting the transition from the horrors of war to the blessing of peace. After ONUMOZ has fulfilled its mandate and completed its withdrawal, the United Nations still has a role to play in Mozambique. The war-damaged infrastructure and economy of that country will require international assistance. Other residual effects of the war must be dealt with, including the thousands upon thousands of anti-personnel land-mines that still pose a threat to the civilian population and will hold back economic recovery for years to come. Also, the amount of arms and weapons which the United Nations has collected from demobilizing soldiers or found in hidden arms caches concerns us. We hope that the United Nations and the newly elected Government of Mozambique will collaborate in the destruction or disabling of these weapons, so that they do not find their way into the black market, and from there into neighbouring countries which themselves are trying to keep their fledgling democracies intact. We urge the Government of Mozambique to attend to this item urgently.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">The reconstruction and rehabilitation of Mozambique can now go forward. My country will be there to help. We must bear in mind, however, that hopes for national unity and recovery can be realized only if Mozambique remains committed to democracy, economic reform and national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">The critical work of reconciliation in Mozambique is far from over. Soldiers laying down their arms and citizens voting in an election are merely steps along the path: big steps -- important steps -- yes; but not the end of the journey. The Government and the people of Mozambique must continue this journey, including the process of political dialogue and reconciliation between the Government and the opposition. The people of Mozambique and the international community have invested too much to leave the work unfinished.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">The United Nations has limited financial and human resources. But when the people of Mozambique asked for assistance it was willingly given. Now the international community will watch carefully to see how the people of Mozambique build on this investment. We all have a stake in continued peaceful progress in Mozambique. The people and the Government owe it not only to themselves but to all of us to forge ahead along the path we have helped them lay out. We believe they can do it. We look forward to following their progress and celebrating further milestones along the way.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">It has been a gratifying personal experience for me to watch this important United Nations operation come to a successful conclusion. I visited Mozambique myself as part of the Security Council Mission last August, and I know the tremendous commitment to overcoming difficult circumstances which all the personnel of ONUMOZ displayed, led by the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr. Aldo Ajello. It is my fervent hope that in the coming months and years, the Council will be able to see other operations brought similarly to triumphant conclusions.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wibisono</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I should like first of all to join other colleagues in welcoming the presence in our midst of the Foreign Minister of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão. My delegation would like to thank him for enlightening us, in a very comprehensive and detailed manner, on the recent important developments in Mozambique, as well as for the kind words addressed to the members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">My delegation commends the efforts made by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in overcoming the obstacles to a peaceful solution to the question of Mozambique. Indeed, their untiring efforts have contributed to the accomplishment of the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), and the successful conclusion of the free and fair elections in Mozambique held at the end of October 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">My delegation pays special tribute to all the United Nations personnel serving under the ONUMOZ mandate, especially because this has been successfully carried out from the inception of the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">We welcome the final report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Operation in Mozambique, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1449.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1449</a> of 23 December 1994, and we fully agree with the "Observations" section of this report. Here, I should like to further emphasize two key factors as contributing to the remarkable achievement of peace in Mozambique: the strong commitment to peace and reconciliation shown by the Mozambican people and their leaders; and the special capability of the United Nations to promote favourable outcomes</p>
	<blockquote id="pg013-bk01-pa05">"when all forces join together in one common endeavour towards a common goal". <i>(S/1994/1449, para. 35)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">I also wish to express my delegation's appreciation of and respect for the positive role played by the Government of Italy in facilitating the signing of the General Peace Agreement on 4 October 1992. This Agreement became an important basis for the peaceful settlement of Mozambique's protracted conflict. In effect, the Mozambican peace process culminated in the peaceful and orderly election of 27 to 29 October 1994, because the conflicting parties had decided to cooperate, and subsequently participated in electing a new, representative and mutually acceptable Government. My Government finds that these outcomes are evidence that political will, expressed as the sustained determination to cooperate between or among conflicting parties, is the essential element required for attaining peace. Therefore, my delegation welcomes the contribution to peace made by all parties, and calls upon them to continue working together towards their country's reconstruction and future development.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">At the same time, on behalf of the Government and people of Indonesia, I should like to applaud the installation on 9 December 1994 of His Excellency Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano as the new President of Mozambique. He has gained office following the first Mozambican multi-party elections conducted in a fair manner, and those elections have brought results accepted by all the country's political parties.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">It is our sincere hope that the Government of Mozambique will succeed in all these endeavours. Meanwhile, my Government urges support for the current troop demobilization scheme being implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with a focus on soldiers' reintegration into Mozambican society.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">We also support the establishment of a national bureau to coordinate various de-mining activities and to ensure the continuance of a national de-mining programme as long as would prove necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">As stated by the Secretary-General in his last report, some issues remain to be pursued, such as the elimination of all armed caches and the safekeeping of collected weapons. The fundamental issue now facing Mozambique's leaders is how to further consolidate democracy so as to ensure the post-election stability and national reconciliation that will lead to a lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">As the peace process in Mozambique has come to a successful conclusion, the expectation of the Indonesian people and Government, as well as of the international community, is that those remarkable achievements can be followed by a concrete effort to improve the well being of all the Mozambican people.</p>

	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">It is indeed a pleasure and an honour to have among us today His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, the Foreign Minister of the new Mozambique Government, whom I most cordially welcome on behalf of my delegation. He epitomizes the success story of his own people and their political leaders, and of United Nations peace-keeping. Traversing the period since 4 October 1992, when the opposing parties in the Mozambican civil war signed the General Peace Agreement in Rome, has not always been easy; not always has there been every ground for optimism. I recall a feature last year in <i>The New York Times </i>Sunday Magazine which dealt with developments in Mozambique almost as an example of all that can go wrong. And yet here we are, greeting in the personage of the Foreign Minister an accomplishment of great importance.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">During last fall's general debate in the General Assembly, my Foreign Minister, Mr. Josef Zieleniec, highlighted the case of Mozambique as an important case study from which the appropriate lessons ought to be drawn. He suggested that the following were among the success factors at play here:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg014-bk01-pa03">"a well-crafted peace plan; a realistic mandate for the United Nations force; the fact that the politicians concerned put the interests of their country above all else; the tenacity of United Nations personnel in carrying out their mandate". <i>(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 15th meeting, p. 15)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The way we are trying to use these or similarly defined factors as a gauge in other operations as well is evident, for example, from the Secretary-General's reflections in his recent Supplement to the Agenda for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Even during this moment of celebration, though, we are all aware that success is not all-encompassing. The residue of its long civil war persists in the country in a number of ways. We are disturbed by the amount of weaponry that circulates freely. The Secretary-General's recent remarks concerning "micro-disarmament" are very pertinent in this context. Mine clearance will entail a long and arduous effort. And, conversely, fatigue with war has slowed the building up of the country's new democratic army.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">Apart from these tasks, we see three types of challenges ahead: political ones, economic ones, and United Nations-connected ones.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">Mozambique's democracy is very, very young and very fragile -- and small wonder. Strengthening it will require careful nurturing for years to come. However, we are encouraged that in their election programmes both major parties declared their adherence to the important principles of protecting the peace and pursuing a policy of national reconciliation. Mozambique can and should become a model for other countries, especially in Africa, by demonstrating that winning elections does not necessarily lead to the arrogance of power and, conversely, that losing elections does not lead to political obliteration. Both of the country's major parties have over the years demonstrated their viability and both no doubt have contributions to make, in one form or another, to the country's future. It is hard to exaggerate how important a flourishing democracy in Mozambique will be for the stability of southern Africa as a whole, including tormented Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">Both parties also focused on raising living standards -- and this is the country's second challenge. Mozambique is today one of the poorest countries of the world, when measured by the economic standards of its people, and even my quick visit there last year as a member of the Security Council Mission left me with an indelible impression of its poverty. The task of improving the lot of the people will perhaps be the toughest of all. But the support for a market-economy development model which both parties profess is encouraging. In our experience, at least, it is the fastest way to mobilize hidden resources of entrepreneurship and industriousness that the country has, including for example those Mozambican expatriates who, having received international assistance to complete their studies abroad, have so far not returned, to contribute to their own country.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">Given these political and economic issues, it is imperative that the United Nations maintain a strong and well-coordinated presence in Mozambique -- and this is our third challenge. The United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) -- to which Czech military observers have also contributed -- is leaving but we cannot in good conscience let the fragile success of peace collapse under the weight of a myriad of post-war problems. Peace-building, peace reinforcement, peace nurturing are what Mozambique needs, with the indispensable assistance of the international community, including the United Nations. This is not the time, and Mozambique is not the place, to let various United Nations agencies do their own thing without tight coordination and without strong political leadership. We therefore sincerely hope that the Secretary-General will maintain in Maputo a well-defined political presence.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">The success of Mozambique is real but it has been greatly underreported. Dramatic successes are perhaps not as attractive to the press as dramatic failures. In the opinion of my delegation, though, what we have learned in Mozambique is extremely valuable not only in connection with one country, with one peace-keeping operation, but also as a model to be emulated in other peace-keeping situations. We congratulate once again the ONUMOZ force and its leaders, the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Ajello, and Mozambique's political leaders -- but, above all, we congratulate the people of Mozambique.</p>

	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">My delegations joins all those that have already participated in this debate in congratulating and welcoming His Excellency the Foreign Minister of Mozambique, Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, who is with us here today. We are most grateful for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">My delegation welcomes the information that has been provided to us today by the Foreign Minister of Mozambique, which confirms what is stated in the latest -- indeed, the final -- report of the Secretary-General of 23 December 1994; namely, that the situation in Mozambique today is one of consolidated peace and that four elements of the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) have been complied with, in conformity with the General Peace Agreement of 1992 -- that is, the political, the military, the electoral and the humanitarian aspects. The operational design of ONUMOZ was based on those four components, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Aldo Ajello, was a very able coordinator.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Mozambique had to overcome many difficulties before it was at last able, with the resolute support of its people and the cooperation of our Organization, to reap the fruits of peace and internal stability.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">The progress achieved in the implementation of the General Peace Agreement shows that the peace process in Mozambique is now real and irreversible. This is largely due to the strong commitment demonstrated by the Government of Mozambique to work together with the United Nations in the peace process. My delegation therefore expresses its gratitude to and solidarity with the people and Government of Mozambique. We congratulate the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, the United Nations Office for Humanitarian Assistance Coordination and the leadership of the forces on this success. We urge the international community to participate actively in Mozambique's reconstruction, rehabilitation and development, so that peace in that country can be consolidated and become permanent. As the Permanent Representative of Italy said:</p>

	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">It is a great honour and a great pleasure for me to warmly welcome His Excellency Foreign Minister Leonardo Simão of Mozambique. The delegation of Rwanda wishes to convey its deep gratitude to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique for all the very useful information he has just given the Council concerning the recent positive political developments in his country.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">On behalf of the people and Government of Rwanda, my delegation wishes to pay a heartfelt tribute to His Excellency Mr. Joaquim Chissano, the first elected President in the history of Mozambique, for his keen insight, his courage and his profound sense of democracy, the cornerstone of lasting peace in Mozambique. Naturally, the same tribute is due to the leaders of RENAMO, who unflinchingly committed themselves to the peace process in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">I also wish to express my delegation's warm and heartfelt congratulations to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique on his accession to his important position, which is an eloquent tribute to the great confidence the people and Government of Mozambique have placed in him.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">The delegation of Rwanda cannot fail to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, our Security Council and the Organization of African Unity -- in short, to the efforts of the entire international community -- for their effective and indeed decisive contribution to the very successful outcome of the peace process in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">My delegation welcomes the firm foundation that has been laid for democracy in Mozambique, a democracy with the added advantage of being multi-party. We also congratulate all its vital elements in Mozambique who resolved courageously, with good will, to bury the hatchet and smoke the pipe of peace together.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">The great success of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) is a source of encouragement to the Security Council in its work and argues for the deployment of ONUMOZ III. Further de-mining efforts should be made in order to allow Mozambique to regain ground on which to carry out in peace the country's reconstruction and socio-economic development. I am well-placed both to know the cost of the horrors of war and to appreciate the very price to be paid for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">This is the occasion to express the hope that the arms dealers who, from near and far, fanned the flames of war in Mozambique, and who bear the grim responsibility of having participated in its destruction, will become Good Samaritans, ready to staunch the wounds of the sons and daughters of Mozambique and take part in its reconstruction and socio-economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">At a time when the international community is concerned with helping Africa to heal the wounds of the many victims of various conflicts, the delegation of Rwanda dares to hope that Mozambique's shining example will illuminate the path of national reconciliation and peace for the rest of the continent. We know that peace is the alpha and omega of all development. Happiness and long life in peace to Mozambique! Happiness and long life to multi-party democracy in Mozambique!</p>

	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Argentina.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">On behalf of my country and my delegation, may I say that the presence of Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, Foreign Minister of Mozambique, honours us here today. We are most grateful for his informative statement and especially for his firm reaffirmation of his country's desire for tolerance and pluralism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">His presence here is a symbol not only of peace, but also of the complexity of the efforts that have sometimes been required to achieve and maintain it. That is why we are particularly enthusiastic about taking part in this meeting of the Security Council, which does not often have the satisfaction of celebrating, as it is today, the establishment of a Government elected in its country's first democratic and pluralistic elections, as is the case with Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">After 15 years of setbacks and struggle, it is clear that the determination to achieve peace and reconciliation has prevailed in Mozambique. The Argentine Republic commends the people of Mozambique for their civic maturity, their insight and their ability to leave behind a harsh past, look together to the future, and work towards that future. It is a future which, to be sure, will not be without its difficulties, but the positive involvement and effort of all members of Mozambican society will, we believe, make it possible to build that future successfully. The people of Mozambique deserve no less.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">We also hail all who have been involved in this process for their tolerance and flexibility -- virtues sadly lacking nowadays -- and for their political will to achieve the peace of which I have spoken.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">The new democracy will need to be strengthened. To that end, the parties concerned must pursue the process of national reconciliation based on a multi-party system and observance of democratic principles, making it possible to put in place lasting peace and political stability and to continue rebuilding the country.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">My Government wants to highlight the international community's positive efforts, coordinated by the United Nations, which provided decisive support and assistance to the peace process in Mozambique. We pay tribute to the leaders and personnel of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). Members will recall that my country had the honour of participating in the Operation, with its Air Force hospital. We highlight and applaud the contribution to the Mozambican peace process made by the Organization of African Unity and by neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">The Government of Mozambique will need to be tireless and determined in its reconstruction and development efforts; we are certain it can count on the necessary assistance and cooperation from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, I convey to President Chissano and to the Government and the entire people of Mozambique our best wishes for a bright, peaceful future; to that end, they can rely upon the friendship and cooperation of the Government and the people of my country.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mérimée</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I have the honour of speaking on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">The European Union would like first of all to welcome to the Security Council the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mozambique, Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, who has honoured us with his presence here today.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">In the past year, after nearly 20 years of conflict, Mozambique has experienced notable events. For the people of Mozambique, the elections held on 27 to 29 October 1994 were a decisive step forward and the culmination of the lengthy peace process that had started in earnest with the signing of the Rome Agreement on 4 October 1992.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">In all, 88 per cent of the 6.4 million Mozambicans who had registered to vote went to the polls over three days to elect their President and their legislators. This shows how eager the Mozambicans, voting for the first time, were to turn a new page in their history.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">This success resulted from a set of factors that deserve to be emphasized. First, the tale of Mozambique would not have had this happy ending without the determination to succeed displayed by the President of Mozambique, Mr. Chissano, and the President of RENAMO, Mr. Dhlakama, both of whom were motivated and encouraged by the Mozambican people's desire for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Secondly, the European Union wishes to pay tribute to all who participated in the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), and in particular to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who supported the efforts of the Mozambicans to make the elections succeed by adapting ONUMOZ to the situation as required.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">Finally, we must emphasize that the management of the case of Mozambique was exemplary with respect to efforts by the countries of the region and by the troop-contributing countries, and with respect to the involvement of donors in the process of implementing the Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">The European Union spared no effort on the Community-wide and bilateral levels to enable us today to say that the United Nations Operation in Mozambique has been a complete success. Suffice it to recall that 80 per cent of the election expenses were defrayed by the European Union, which during the balloting provided 200 observers in addition to those serving as United Nations international observers.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">The European Union intends to continue its Community-wide and bilateral efforts to promote peace-building in Mozambique. In its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-957(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 957 (1994)</a> of 15 November 1994, the Security Council set 31 January 1995 for the withdrawal of ONUMOZ. Clearly, the Mozambicans will not be abandoned after that date. United Nations specialized agencies will replace the blue helmets to coordinate the development and growth of the country in order to consolidate the new peace. We appeal to the Secretary-General to ensure that this takes place.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">It is for that very purpose that the European Union will continue its assistance. All Mozambicans must be able to see their ballot transformed into a road map to democracy and progress.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">In that connection, the European Union attaches great importance to true national reconciliation. We hope that sincere cooperation between the majority and the opposition will be among the new Government's priorities. We think the opposition ought to be represented both at the governmental and at the local level. The European Union stresses that peace in Mozambique deserves participation by all Mozambicans in its consolidation.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">More broadly speaking, the European Union notes that the success of the operation in Mozambique, following the elections in South Africa, is a source of encouragement for the process of democratization and progress throughout southern Africa. We hope that Angola will follow Mozambique's example and soon rejoin the ranks of democratic countries advancing towards political renewal and economic and social development.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Brazil. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valle</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">For more than two years, the Security Council has followed with keen interest and concern the evolution of the situation in Mozambique. My delegation is extremely pleased that the Security Council has decided to hold a debate on an issue the outcome of which has been very much welcomed by the entire international community. Gathered here today, in a far different atmosphere and with a clearly different purpose, the Council is considering the conclusion of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ).</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">First of all, I would like to welcome very warmly His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique, and thank him for the very comprehensive statement he made. His thorough analysis of the situation clearly demonstrates the magnitude of the achievements attained by the implementation of the Rome peace accord. My delegation was particularly impressed by his words, in the light of the huge challenges facing his Government in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of his country.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">It is a known fact that Brazil feels very closely linked to Mozambique, given our common historical, cultural and ancestral ties. We maintain with that sister country an intense relationship that both Governments have been continuously nurturing over a long period of time. With the successful conclusion of the peace process, as provided for in the accords of 1992, our relations are bound to grow even closer at a moment when Mozambique takes decisive strides on the path of peace, stability and economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">The meeting today should result in an appraisal of the collective effort of the international community towards ensuring peace and stability in a country ravaged by conflict for well over a decade. The accomplishment of the Operation just concluded has decisively contributed to the elimination of the horrors of war and the creation of an environment allowing political negotiation to prevail over confrontation, and understanding over suspicion.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">There is no better way to successfully conclude a peace process than to abide by the wishes of the people. The general elections held in October 1994 represent a milestone for the country. The elections were conducted in a remarkably peaceful and orderly manner. The massive participation of voters, just shy of 90 per cent, clearly indicates the desire of an entire people to actively participate in the shaping of the future of their country. It also signifies the strong will of Mozambicans to start a new period in their history, leaving behind war and suffering. It should also be noted, as pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report, that all Mozambican political parties have accepted the results of the elections. This is an obvious indication that peace, stability and democracy are part of an irreversible process in Mozambique, dispelling the fears of some Member States that the elections might not be free and fair.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">My Government has consistently supported the United Nations efforts to bring peace to Mozambique, both as a member of the Security Council in the biennium 1993-1994, when the Council was actively seized of the matter, and as a troop contributor to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). A Brazilian military officer, General Lélio Rodrigues, had the privilege of being the first force commander of ONUMOZ. Later, in 1994, Brazil sent an infantry company that was deployed in the region of Zambézia and contributed actively to the process of assembly of troops and demobilization.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">We have also consistently stressed our position that ONUMOZ, as well as any other peace-keeping operation of the Organization, should be established and deployed in the name of the United Nations as a whole, and not of the Security Council alone. My delegation has repeatedly underscored the two main policy principles that have guided our position. First, peace-keeping operations must be aimed at contributing to alleviating tensions and promoting peace in regional conflicts that pose a threat to peace and stability. Secondly, peace-keeping operations must be absolutely impartial if they are to implement their mandates successfully. These operations constitute an important means to assist in the implementation of agreements to which the parties have freely committed themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">The success story of ONUMOZ allows us to draw some conclusions on ongoing and future United Nations efforts in the field of peace-keeping. To be effective, these operations have to be adequately staffed and equipped; delays in their deployment are to be avoided at all costs.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">Most important is the need to persevere in the search for peace when the commitment to national reconciliation prevails among the parties. No precipitate reduction or withdrawal of the personnel of any operation should occur without prior determination of the impact on the operation's capability to discharge its mandate successfully.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">In the specific case of Mozambique, fortunately, the Council in its wisdom avoided a premature reduction of the military component of ONUMOZ at a crucial moment in the peace process, when demobilization was still under way and the formation of the new defence force had barely begun. We have always stressed that if peace has its costs, the absence of peace is even costlier.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">Peace in Mozambique was possible because of a combination of domestic and international factors. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General, together with the force commander and all the personnel of ONUMOZ -- military, civil police and civilian staff -- deserve our recognition for the successful conclusion of the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">Although the support provided by the international community was substantial and decisive, the Operation owes its success to the unequivocal commitment to peace of the people of Mozambique as a whole and, in particular, that of President Joaquim Chissano. My delegation pays its sincerest tribute to his leadership, political wisdom and true statesmanship, which played a vital role in the successful conclusion of the peace process. Our recognition is extended to the people of Mozambique, who must receive the ultimate praise for the success story of ONUMOZ.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">Finally, we would like to express our hope that the successful trend which started in South Africa, has now been repeated in Mozambique and is being extended to Angola can indeed spread northward in Africa and, hopefully, to other peace-keeping operations in troubled areas in other continents.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa14">As we witness the dawning of a new era in Mozambique, the international community should, in order to reaffirm its commitment to the welfare of that country and of the entire subregion, shift its efforts from peacemaking to reconstruction, rehabilitation and development in Mozambique. Brazil stands ready to continue to do its part.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Karsgaard</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">I would first like to warmly welcome the presence today in the Security Council of His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Simão, Foreign Minister of Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">I would also like to express Canada's admiration for the courage and determination shown by the people of Mozambique and their political leaders during the transformation that has taken place since the signing of the Peace Agreement in Rome in October 1992. After years of war, Mozambique is now making a new start. The process was at times frustrating and slow, but it has been distinguished by a strong commitment to lasting peace by both of the parties to the Agreement. That desire for peace was most evident in the high level of participation in last year's elections and the fervent determination of Mozambique's election officials to ensure that the voting was conducted freely and fairly.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">We are encouraged by the role that the United Nations has played in Mozambique. It has demonstrated once again the readiness of the international community to help implement the numerous and varied provisions of a comprehensive peace agreement. It also confirms our belief in how much can be accomplished through multilateral action if the mandates set by the Council are achievable, the time-frames remain realistic, our approach is flexible and the commitment to peace among the parties involved is genuine. The United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) undertook a complex task that required a high degree of cooperation and coordination between United Nations agencies, bilateral donors, non-governmental organizations and the parties to the Peace Agreement. That cooperation and coordination was largely sustained throughout the two-year life of ONUMOZ, and the objectives were achieved. A good measure of the credit for this success must go to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who discharged his duties with determination and skill.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">The overall accomplishments of the operation should not, however, keep us from re-examining the events of the past two years to identify areas where improvements or changes can be made. We are thinking, in particular, of delays in the deployment of ONUMOZ and of difficulties encountered in the launching of the de-mining programme. At the same time, we should also look at what worked well, to learn from our successes. Certainly this should include the effectiveness of the demobilization programme and the fact that the elections themselves went remarkably smoothly, under difficult circumstances, thanks in part to the useful support provided by the United Nations Development Programme to the National Elections Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">Canadians are proud to have contributed to the successful conclusion of the peace process in Mozambique through our bilateral and multilateral assistance, as well as through our participation in ONUMOZ. Mozambique is currently the largest recipient of Canadian aid in Africa. Much of the over $100 million we have provided during the past two years has directly benefited the peace process; it has included food aid, grants for refugee repatriation, support for troop demobilization and electoral assistance.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">We should also acknowledge and commend the contribution of Mozambique's neighbours in southern Africa in sustaining the momentum for change and democracy in Mozambique, both by their example and through their direct involvement. The informal cooperation that now exists on security issues in the region and the conclusion of more formal economic cooperation arrangements have contributed significantly towards building confidence in the prospect of a more secure, democratic and prosperous future for southern Africa. Canada is encouraged by these developments and supports the efforts now under way to enhance the capability of regional organizations and the Organization of African Unity, not only to contribute to the resolution of conflicts but, more importantly, to prevent other conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">The withdrawal of ONUMOZ and the formation of a new Government in Maputo mark the end of the formal peace process. The building of a sustainable democracy is now beginning. We wish Mozambicans every success as they confront the challenges of national reconciliation and reconstruction. We also urge the new Government to respect the political diversity of its nation, to promote accountable government, to defend human rights and to consult broadly as it develops its plans for the future. For our part, I wish to assure the Council that Canada will continue to offer financial and technical assistance to Mozambique as it meets these challenges.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa01">It was with great pleasure that I listened to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Simão, in which he described the optimism of the people of Mozambique as they embark upon the task of national reconstruction and development. I am delighted to have this opportunity to congratulate him and the other members of the Cabinet of the duly elected President of the Republic of Mozambique, His Excellency Mr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, on the assumption of their respective posts.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa02">I should also like to express my deep appreciation to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Aldo Ajello, and to all the men and women involved in the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), which promoted the peaceful settlement of the situation there. Japan heartily welcomes the success of the United Nations effort, which culminated in the establishment of a democratic Government in Mozambique. I am pleased to note that members of the Japanese Self-Defence Forces and Japanese electoral observers participated in that effort.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa03">ONUMOZ will surely be counted among the most successful United Nations peace-keeping operations. I believe it succeeded for the following reasons.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa04">First, the conflicting parties were clearly supportive of the peace process sponsored by the international community, and strictly observed the cease-fire. It should also be noted that the United Nations remained committed to the effort and insisted that both the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO cooperate in advancing the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa05">Secondly, building upon the experience gained in Angola, the United Nations Operation focused on demobilization and, in an effort to address the needs of demobilized soldiers, established civilian technical units.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa06">Thirdly, ONUMOZ operated flexibly, making the most effective use of a limited number of personnel. Indeed, the importance of this point should not be underestimated, and it should serve as a lesson for the conduct of future operations.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa07">Finally, the peace process in Mozambique enjoyed the strong support of the United Nations, centring on ONUMOZ, and of the entire international community. The mobilization of donor countries to finance the reconstruction and redevelopment of Mozambique was an especially significant element in the Operation's success.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa08">Peace has finally been achieved in Mozambique, but the long and laborious task of national reconstruction still lies ahead. If peace is to take firm hold, it is essential that the principles and the spirit of democracy be disseminated throughout the country and national reconciliation efforts accelerated. There are many obstacles to be overcome, however. The elimination of anti-personnel land-mines is just one of the urgent problems that must be addressed. Reconstruction of the war-ravaged infrastructure and the reintegration into civilian society of demobilized soldiers are also problems of pressing concern.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa09">Clearly, the people of Mozambique will require the continued support of the international community for the foreseeable future. My Government, for its part, will continue to contribute to the reconstruction of Mozambique and to the stability of southern Africa.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Egypt. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Awaad</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">The delegation of Egypt would like, at the outset, to thank and congratulate the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mozambique, Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, for his very thorough statement, during which he referred to the political developments in his country as well as his Government's efforts to initiate a new stage in the reconstruction of the country's civilian infrastructure and to restore its public utilities.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">Egypt has followed with interest the evolution of the situation in Mozambique since the beginning of the crisis. It is very happy that the operation culminated successfully in the peace settlement and that the free and honest elections, successfully held and observed by the international community, resulted in the Government that is now in power.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">The success of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) is a further episode to the credit of the United Nations in the field of peace-keeping. This success was not the result of chance; on the contrary, it was the natural outcome of a series of factors, the most important of which was the presence of a genuine political will on the part of both parties to the conflict and total respect for their commitments, including the efforts made by the United Nations, represented by the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who was assisted by the positive efforts of influential States, which encouraged the parties involved to respect the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes and national reconciliation and the wishes of the Mozambican people.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">We should like to refer in particular to the very constructive role played by Italy in the achievement of this objective. The Security Council, which is now examining the future of peace-keeping operations undertaken by this Organization, should focus on an analysis of the factors that made for the success of the operation in Mozambique, with a view to drawing on them in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">Despite the important positive outcome of the Mozambican situation, there are still large security, economic, social and humanitarian problems. The new Government cannot deal with these problems on its own; it needs the support and assistance of the United Nations agencies and bodies to overcome the negative aftermath of the conflict. I refer in particular to the massive flow of refugees who are returning and need to be repatriated -- about 1 million of them, in addition to about 3 million displaced persons within or outside the national frontiers.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">In addition, it will be necessary to create a new national army, following completion of the task of disarming both the parties, in order to stabilize the situation. It will also be necessary to carry out de-mining operations and to reinitiate the process of strengthening confidence between the political parties in Mozambique. For its part, Egypt, having participated in the United Nations Operation in Mozambique and having been an observer of the elections, commits itself to providing the Government and people of Mozambique with all possible support and assistance in their efforts to rebuild the State and its infrastructures.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">The Egyptian delegation would also like to reiterate the importance of the new role that it is incumbent on the United Nations to play in Mozambique -- a role that is no less important than the one played by the Organization at the previous stage -- particularly with respect to efforts to rehabilitate approximately 90,000 combatants of the former Government Army and the RENAMO forces, on an equal footing, and to integrate them into civilian life to take part in the process of national reconstruction and the development of Mozambique, as well as the training of approximately 450 troops in de-mining. Here, I should like to say that Egypt awaits with some interest the report to be submitted by the Secretary-General to the Security Council. That will contain his recommendations with regard to the future role that the international Organization might play at the political, humanitarian and economic levels in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, I should like once again to address my thanks and congratulations to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mozambique. I wish him every success in his arduous task. We congratulate the friendly and fraternal people of Mozambique from the bottom of our hearts.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Portugal. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Catarino</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Allow me first to congratulate you, Mr. President, on the very able manner in which you have steered the work of the Council throughout the month of January. A very special word of appreciation is also due for the efforts of your delegation in keeping Member States very well informed, on a daily basis, about the work of the Council. I should also like to congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Bakuramutsa, on his work as President of the Council in December.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">I take this opportunity to welcome very warmly His Excellency the Foreign Minister of Mozambique, Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, whose presence here today clearly reflects the significance his Government attributes to the role that the United Nations has played and will continue to play in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">The Permanent Representative of France has already spoken on behalf of the European Union, and Portugal associates itself fully with that statement. I should like, however, to add a few words on this question, which is of particular importance to my country.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">I need not remind the Council of the special relationship that exists between Portugal and Mozambique, resulting from historical ties consolidated during the course of centuries, which today is embodied in the profound friendship between the two peoples and in the close cooperation between the two countries. It was therefore with a profound sense of pleasure that Portugal witnessed the positive manner in which the peace process in Mozambique was carried out.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">Portugal played an active role throughout the process, from the very beginning. As an observer of the peace negotiations, we participated fully in the process that led to the signing of the General Peace Agreement. We then contributed significantly to its implementation on the ground. We took part in all the international commissions created by the General Peace Agreement, as well as in the Joint Commission for the formation of the armed forces of Mozambique. Portugal was entrusted with the task of forming three battalions of special forces, one company of marines and a number of logistics units.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">In addition, Portugal has supported the organic and conceptual reorganization of the armed forces through the dispatch to Mozambique of a specialized team composed of 100 officers and non-commissioned officers. Without a doubt, our common language and the profound mutual understanding between our peoples were decisive factors in the success of these actions.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">Portugal also actively participated in ONUMOZ, both in its command structure and by sending a communications battalion which guaranteed, with great technical competence I might add, the communications network of that Operation throughout the implementation of the peace process. We also deployed close to 60 police officers to the ONUMOZ contingent of civilian police observers, which played a crucial role in the successful outcome of the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">A Portuguese judge was one of the members of the electoral tribunal. Portugal was also present in the international monitoring effort through the deployment of 42 observers, 30 of whom were part of EUMOZ, the electoral monitoring operation of the European Union established following a proposal put forward by my country.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">The Portuguese Government has always held that only through the full implementation of the General Peace Agreement will the parties be able successfully to complete the process designed to bring to an end the suffering of a people burdened by many years of war. At a decisive moment, the Mozambican people showed in a civil and serene manner through an impressive turnout at the polls that, regardless of whom they voted for, they fundamentally desired peace. The political leaders of Mozambique, encouraged by the positive examples in the region, also contributed towards bringing about the tide of stability that has emerged. The outcome of the peace process in Mozambique represents a further step towards the development and progress of a democratic southern Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">Naturally, the role of the United Nations in this process has been crucial. At this point, I should like to pay tribute to the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, and in particular to his Special Representative, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who always found a way out at critical moments in a process that demanded not only a mediatory role but also one of bringing the parties closer together and promoting understanding between them.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">I would be committing an injustice if I did not equally pay tribute here to the work carried out by this body, the Security Council, which, throughout the peace process, showed in a clear manner the importance placed by the international community in, and its commitment to, a successful implementation of the General Peace Agreement. At a very delicate stage of the process, the Security Council did not hesitate to send a mission to Mozambique, which enhanced the impact and credibility of ONUMOZ, as well as a better understanding of the manner of ensuring the full implementation of the General Peace Agreement within the established time-frame.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa12">It is true that the role of the international community has been extremely important over the last two years. It should not, however, end here. We have witnessed the process of pacification and democratization of Mozambique. It is now essential to support the consolidation of democracy. This will be the only way of guaranteeing, over the long term, the fruition of the investment made by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa13">We therefore appeal to the international community to maintain its efforts now and to support, at both the bilateral and the multilateral levels, the reconstruction and development of Mozambique in such a way as to guarantee the consolidation of peace and democracy in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa14">The recent positive developments that have occurred in the region have had a positive influence on the choices made by the Mozambicans. Similarly, there can be no doubt that the consolidation of peace and democracy in Mozambique will contribute significantly to regional stability.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa15">It is therefore necessary to continue on the path of the process, already under way, of the reconciliation of the Mozambican family and of an institutionalized democracy, in which all can contribute usefully to the development of the country in an atmosphere of mutual respect and observance of democratic principles. This evolution will also depend on the Mozambican people's perception of their future prospects. It is therefore essential that the international community provide the necessary assistance which ensure these prospects of progress and sustainable development, particularly through the international financial institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa16">On our part, we remain committed to taking on a front-line role in helping in the reconstruction of Mozambique. In this context, I should like to point out that Portugal's largest foreign-investment project relates to the Cahora Bassa dam, an enormous undertaking which we hope will come to benefit in a significant manner, particularly in the key sector of energy, the economy of Mozambique, as well as those of other countries in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa17">Nearly 18 years of civil war certainly planted some seeds of mistrust. We are confident that the continued effort and commitment of the international community and the political and civil maturity already shown by the Mozambicans will prevent those seeds from taking root and will allow Mozambique to live in a new era of peace and prosperity.</p>
