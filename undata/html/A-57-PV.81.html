	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">Before we proceed to the item on our agenda, allow me to make a short statement. I would like to express my deep shock and sadness upon learning of the assassination of His Excellency Zoran Djindjic, Prime Minister of Serbia. I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to the Government and people of Serbia and to Mr. Djindjic's family in their loss.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">I personally feel very strongly about this and share the pain caused by this cruel act, as Zoran was a friend of mine and a former fellow human rights dissident. I worked with him when we were both dissidents, as well as when he continued in his opposition to the Milosevic regime and I was Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, and lastly when we were both in top Government positions and endeavoured to work for a democratic Central Europe as our contribution to better conditions in Europe and the world.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">A violent act, deplorable as it is in itself, is particularly so when perpetrated against a democratically elected head of Government. I firmly believe that this act of political violence should in no way stop the progress that Serbia has made in the process of democratization, of reform and of international cooperation. I perceive it also as a challenge to us all and as a reminder that we have to continue to help to consolidate democratic forces throughout the world.</p>
