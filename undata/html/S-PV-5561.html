I am sure I speak for all members of the Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Oshima for the great diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council's business last month.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I would like to say a few words as I take up this important post. Peru is very honoured to assume the presidency of the Security Council for the month of November. As I assume this important responsibility, I would first like to affirm the commitment of the Government of Peru to working in a constructive and responsible manner in order, effectively and in a timely manner, to address the various issues before the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Peru's commitment to the United Nations system, its organs and its areas of responsibility is a constant feature of its foreign policy. My country is a founding Member of the United Nations. Throughout the Organization's 61 years of existence, we have supported its efforts to tackle the many challenges involved in the maintenance of international peace and security. Eminent Peruvians have presided over the General Assembly and the International Court of Justice and have served as Secretary-General. They exemplify my country's commitment to the work of our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Peru is a democratic and multicultural nation that has been shaping its identity through the interplay and integration of the contributions of our indigenous culture with other cultures from diverse parts of the world. At the start of a new century, my country is focusing its efforts on consolidating its socio-economic development. That involves efficient integration with the world's various areas and regions. Peru is committed to constructively contributing towards the strengthening of global processes and, in particular, to promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes and problems that affect international peace and security. We were honoured by the international community's recognition of that commitment when last year Peru was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Throughout the year, we have been delivering on our promises by working with all of the countries represented in the Council. This month, our responsibility will be even greater. But I am convinced that, with the cooperation of all delegations and the Secretariat, we will be able to carry out this important task in the best possible manner.</p>
