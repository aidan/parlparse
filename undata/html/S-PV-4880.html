	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the launching of a review mechanism, under the auspices of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, as presented on 5 November 2003 in Pristina and Belgrade, on the initiative of the Contact Group (France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America, with representatives from the European Union), giving new momentum to the implementation of the 'standards before status' policy that was designed for Kosovo (Serbia and Montenegro), and endorsed by this Council in application of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council recalls the eight standards, namely: functioning democratic institutions; rule of law; freedom of movement; returns and reintegration; economy; property rights; dialogue with Belgrade; and the Kosovo Protection Corps. The Council in this respect urges the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government to participate fully and constructively in the working groups within the framework of the direct dialogue with Belgrade on practical issues of mutual interest, to demonstrate their commitment to the process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council supports the standards for Kosovo presented on 10 December 2003. The Council awaits an implementation plan, to be finalized by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in his continuing consultation with the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, and other relevant parties as appropriate, to be submitted to the Council. The plan should serve as a basis for the assessment of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government's progress in meeting the standards.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council takes note that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, within his authority as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, inter alia, in the context of the review mechanism, will continue to consult closely with interested parties, in particular the Contact Group. The Council reaffirms its intention to continue to consider the regular reports of the Secretary-General, including an assessment from the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, as to the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government's progress towards meeting the standards. The Council takes note that the Contact Group intends to make a substantive contribution to the regular reviews and to submit its assessments to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council supports the prospect of a comprehensive review of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government's progress in meeting the standards. The Council notes that, depending on progress made as assessed during the periodical review, a first opportunity for such a comprehensive review should occur around mid-2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"Reaffirming the standards before status policy, the Council stresses that further advancement towards a process to determine the future status of Kosovo in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> will depend on the positive outcome of this comprehensive review. The Council reiterates the primacy of the regulations promulgated by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and subsidiary instruments as the law applicable in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reaffirms its full support to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Holkeri and calls on the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo and all concerned to cooperate fully with him."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-26.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/26</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
