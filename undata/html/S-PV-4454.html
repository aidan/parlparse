<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guéhenno</span> <span class="non-nation">Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Secretary-General's report on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). This report covers pivotal events over the last three months that not only mark a great accomplishment for the people of Kosovo, and for the international community, but also open the door to new opportunities for all parties in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Since UNMIK's inception in 1999, the international community has worked with the people of Kosovo to create the institutions and the conditions on the ground to establish provisional self-government. Over the last three months we have come closer to this goal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">On 17 November 2001, Kosovo-wide elections were held in a generally peaceful environment. With the institution-building pillar of UNMIK and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the lead, the elections were well organized and executed both within and outside Kosovo. As the report points out, the elections did not result in one party having the necessary majority in the Assembly to form a Government without entering into a coalition.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">The focus of UNMIK's work prior to the elections had been on convincing the Kosovo Serb community that only through participation in the legitimate institutions of provisional self-government can their grievances be adequately addressed and progress be forged. The signing of the Common Document in Belgrade on 5 November 2001 by Special Representative Haekkerup and Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Covic was an important step in engaging the Kosovo Serbs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">The Common Document elaborated on UNMIK's past and present efforts in creating the conditions necessary for effective participation in the provisional institutions of self-government. The Document also created a basis for a cooperative relationship with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Common Document establishes a high-ranking working group, which will include members of the provisional institutions of self-government, thus creating direct contact between Kosovo's leaders and leaders in Belgrade. The high-ranking working group has already met once and is scheduled to meet again today.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">The report elaborates on some of the steps listed in the Common Document that have already been taken, including the promulgation of a regulation on transparent and non-discriminatory recruiting procedures in the Civil Service and the creation of the Office of Returns and Communities in the office of the Special Representative.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">UNMIK continues to work to create an environment in which Kosovo's minority communities will feel secure in participating in public life. The high level of Kosovo minority community participation in the elections is evidence of some success in this endeavour. The fact that there were no serious security incidents on election day is a tribute to the people of Kosovo and to the security elements, including the Kosovo Police Service, UNMIK police and KFOR. The Kosovo Police Service was charged with, and has successfully executed, providing security for the Assembly members within the Assembly building. Special arrangements were made for the protection of the 22 Kosovo Serb members' travel to and from the Assembly building.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">Overall, the last three months had been relatively calm until the very sad incident that I have to report to the Council. On 17 January, Mr. Ismail Hajdaraj, an Assembly member of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), was murdered in the Pec region. UNMIK strongly condemned the act. On the initiative of the President of the Assembly, a commemorative ceremony was held on 19 January. UNMIK police have launched a thorough investigation into the matter. At this point, the motivation behind the killing is unclear.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">The inaugural Assembly session, held on 10 December 2001, was successful in constituting the Assembly and in electing a President of the Assembly. However, progress in electing the President and Prime Minister of Kosovo, and in thus forming a Government, was not made at either the 13 December 2001 or the 10 January 2002 Assembly sessions. The Assembly has not met since 10 January, and the deadlock in forming a coalition persists. UNMIK and interested members continue to impress upon the various actors the importance of an early solution to the current stalemate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">UNMIK has also laid the administrative groundwork necessary to restructure its own organization to complement the eventual establishment of provisional self-government. The majority of UNMIK staff in Pristina vacated their offices in the Assembly building, and buildings were prepared to make space for the new institutions. The 20 Joint Interim Administrative Structures were consolidated into nine Transitional Departments. These Departments will become ministries as soon as a Government is formed. International staff will continue to serve in the ministries with a role progressively changing from executive to advisory. Directorates have been established for Civil Protection, Administrative Affairs, Infrastructure Affairs and Rural Affairs to discharge the powers reserved to the Special Representative. At the municipal level, UNMIK administrators have been handing over responsibility to the local authorities, including Kosovo Serbs and other members of Kosovo's minority communities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">UNMIK continues its efforts to bring the Kosovo Serbs and other minorities into the legitimate structures of the provisional institutions of self-government. The Regional Administrator in Mitrovica is establishing an UNMIK office in northern Mitrovica. A more active and robust approach by UNMIK and KFOR towards the so-called bridge-watchers has helped decrease the level of violence in northern Mitrovica and appears to have undermined some of the support for the so-called bridge-watchers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">With regard to the economic reconstruction of Kosovo, several important developments have taken place. The 2002 budget was drawn up with the aim of ensuring that recurring expenditures can be met by tax revenues generated domestically. In order to make this possible, new wage and profit tax regulations have been prepared for introduction this year. The currency conversion from the deutsche mark to the euro proceeded smoothly. UNMIK's strategy to minimize the need for cash exchanges by encouraging the people to open bank accounts has been successful. The challenge still remains for the European Union-led pillar on economic reconstruction to solve the power problem plaguing Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa13">While we can look back at tangible achievements, it is apparent that a great deal still needs to be accomplished with the support of this Council and the European Union, the OSCE and all the Member States contributing to UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa14">Finally, I would like to inform the Council that the Secretary-General has taken a decision on the appointment of a new Special Representative and that a letter is on its way to the Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno for his briefing.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Strømmen</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">I thank Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his briefing and the Secretary-General for his report on the work of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) over the last three months. Let me also express my Government's gratitude to Hans Haekkerup for his leadership and tireless efforts to improve the situation of all the people of Kosovo. Norway also looks forward to working closely with the next Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The election on 17 November and the inaugural session of the Assembly on 10 December last year were important milestones in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The newly elected Kosovo representatives now find themselves faced with the realities and challenges of a multiparty democracy. With no party large enough to govern alone, compromise and coalition-building across political and ethnic divisions will be key to the success of the new Assembly. The current deadlock regarding the election of a provincial President shows that there is an urgent need for all political leaders to demonstrate reconciliation and responsible self-government.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">We welcome the preparations made by UNMIK for a gradual transfer of administrative authority to the provisional self-government institutions. Experience at the local level, after the municipal elections in 2000, indicates the challenges that lie ahead. Elected representatives and civil servants must now prepare themselves to take over responsibilities from UNMIK with professionalism and efficiency.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">In accordance with the Constitutional Framework, UNMIK and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General will continue to fulfil vital functions in Kosovo. We expect the elected representatives and self-government officials to recognize the necessity and benefit of close cooperation with UNMIK and the Special Representative.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Despite a decrease in the number of serious incidents over the last months, security and freedom of movement for minorities remain unsatisfactory. No large-scale return of displaced Kosovo Serbs can be expected unless the security situation is considerably improved. UNMIK and KFOR must do what they can, but, as the Secretary-General indicates in his report, if we want to improve the still serious security situation, people's attitudes must change. And in this, the newly elected political leaders have a primary role in promoting tolerance towards minorities and in making it clear to the people of Kosovo that creating security and reconciliation is their own responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Norway supports the establishment of an Office of Returns and Communities within UNMIK, but return is another issue that cannot be left only to the international community. An important measure of the success of the new institutions of self-government in Kosovo will be whether larger-scale return can be facilitated.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Norway welcomes the formation of a High-ranking Working Group on cooperation between UNMIK and Yugoslav authorities, as foreseen in the Common Document of 5 November 2001. This must not be perceived as a channel only between UNMIK and Belgrade. A main objective must be to promote a constructive and direct dialogue between the democratically elected leaders of Kosovo and Yugoslavia. A pragmatic, solution-oriented approach should guide this cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">We are encouraged by the progress made to date as regards missing persons, as well as on Kosovo Albanians detained in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Further progress on these issues can and should be made without delay under the auspices of the joint Common Document. This will help turn the page from conflict to reconciliation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">We welcome and fully support the measures taken by UNMIK to strengthen its capacity to counter terrorism and organized crime. In addition to the concerted efforts of UNMIK and KFOR, the newly elected Assembly members must take the lead in openly rejecting hate speech, ethnically motivated violence, terrorism and organized crime. The killing of a Kosovo Assembly member last week reminds us of the challenges still facing us.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">We have taken note of the decision of the Kosovo Supreme Court to release from custody three Kosovo Albanians suspected of involvement in the bombing of the Nis Express Bus in February 2001. We urge UNMIK police and KFOR to make all efforts necessary to bring to justice those responsible for this terrorist act.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Lajous</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01">At the outset, my delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for his report on the activities of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) over the past three months. The report clearly describes progress made during that period and the challenges that must be addressed in the immediate future.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa02">Mexico also extends its deep thanks for the work done by Mr. Haekkerup at the helm of UNMIK and to all the staff of the Mission for their excellent work, undertaken with the support of several non-governmental and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa03">The international community still remembers the suffering of the Kosovars during their painful flight not long ago, when they had to leave their homes and fight for their survival. In 1999, I was Mexico's Ambassador to Austria and visited the Kosovar refugee camps there in order to report back to my Government. I remember very clearly that, despite the enormous efforts of the Austrian Government, the European Union and the international community as a whole to support the thousands of displaced persons, their anguish touched the entire world. I recall the uncertainty on the faces of men and women who did not know when or how they would ever be able to return home.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa04">Today, thanks to the work of the United Nations, it is possible for an ever increasing number of such people -- which we hope to see increase further -- to return to their homes. Thanks to UNMIK, it has been possible to normalize life in all their communities. The States Members of this Organization can be proud of all that has been achieved, although much remains to be done. The most important task is to complete the training and preparation of local administrators to assume control of the institutions of self-government. UNMIK deserves ample recognition for its work, but its responsibilities must in no way be considered permanent or long-term.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa05">My Government welcomes the outcome of the 17 November election and the launching of the work of the Assembly. We trust that it will soon be possible to establish provisional self-government in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We also strongly hope that those in charge of self-government will work in a spirit of inter-community tolerance. To that end, we must encourage respect and mutual tolerance that will permeate the executive functions of the officials of local self-government. In this connection, Mexico would stress the progress made in strengthening the structures of the domestic judiciary, as referred to in paragraph 25 of the Secretary-General's report. The rule of law is the best way to combat organized crime, which flourishes wherever there is a vacuum in the judiciary and, by extension, in the power structure.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa06">One pending task is the return of all refugees and displaced persons to their places of origin and homes. That will offer the greatest proof that the various political forces representing all ethnic groups have achieved harmony within the province. Mexico supports and believes in the ability of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to carry that process forward. Another way in which it could help to achieve this would be to implement the agreement with the International Commission on Missing Persons so as to advance in the identification of the missing.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa07">Mexico is proud to be a multi-ethnic country, one in which various ethnic groups live together and in which there are 56 living indigenous languages. An educational system that encourages tolerance and respect for the mosaic of our various ethnic identities is one of the factors that has contributed to coexistence and national integration. We firmly believe that one of the things UNMIK can do to help normalize life in the province is to oversee the establishment of an educational system in Kosovo that encourages a culture of coexistence between the various ethnic groups and respect for their various expressions.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahbubani</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">We, too, would like to begin by thanking Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno for his usual comprehensive briefing. We would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report and, like our colleagues, we would also like to pay a special tribute to Mr. Hans Haekkerup, who demonstrated wise and effective leadership at a crucial time for Kosovo. Obstacles were overcome and steps forward were made. Our only regret is that Mr. Haekkerup is not here to say goodbye to us and to share with us his farewell reflections. We are of course pleased to hear that a letter will be on its way shortly to Mr. Haekkerup's successor, but I gather that the press revealed the name of his successor to most of us before we were told officially.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Before going into the latest events, it may perhaps be useful to step back and look at the big picture a little, and perhaps to bear in mind that Kosovo is a somewhat unusual peacekeeping operation. It functions, in some ways, more like a trusteeship operation. The United Nations is, in a sense, holding Kosovo in trust before a final political solution is found -- of course, on the basis of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. But we all know that today no territory can be held in trust forever. I think one common condition that all of mankind wishes to enjoy is the sense of control over our lives, the sense of being in charge. This must be, in a sense, the direction that we should be heading in, and it must be clear that whatever we do must take steps towards that goal.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Of course, we are aware that to achieve that there will be many serious problems in the short term. Indeed, Mr. Guéhenno referred to the very tragic killings on 17 January. Actually, we are also disappointed to hear that the elections for President have not yet taken place. But while we should bear in mind these short-term problems, we should perhaps also balance that by bearing in mind that the long-term future of Kosovo and its people has to be bright. It has to be bright because they have the good fortune of being situated in the very fortunate continent of Europe, where we are, in some ways, seeing what may perhaps be the greatest social and political experiment ever undertaken in the history of man. A continent where for centuries countries used to fight over their borders -- and, indeed, where millions died fighting over those borders -- is now becoming truly a borderless world and, frankly, with the launch of the euro, that borderless world has been carried to a great new height. That is ultimately the happy destination that Kosovo and its neighbours can enjoy. Our challenge is to see how we can help Kosovo reach that happy destination as quickly as possible. It is therefore in this light that we raise a few questions and make some suggestions about where we go from here.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Clearly, the first point to emerge -- even in listening to my colleagues from Norway and Mexico -- is clearly that after the elections we have to move Kosovo towards greater self-governance and, in a sense, towards greater autonomy. For that to happen it is necessary for the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to try to devolve as many of its responsibilities as possible to Kosovo leaders, except, of course, core civilian functions. That must be, in a sense, the direction in which the United Nations must go. The leaders of Kosovo must be allowed to show that they can exercise due responsibility and care in governing the province, even in a limited way. As I said earlier, that is the direction in which all of us want to go. In this way we hope that the elected leaders will also gain the confidence of the people of Kosovo, both the majority and the minorities. Hopefully, over time mutual trust between the leaders and the people can be built up, as well as among the various ethnic communities. We hope that will lead to reconciliation. A democratic, multi-ethnic and economically vibrant society in Kosovo is the only solution to the Kosovo problem. The key is therefore to get UNMIK to gradually hand over the appropriate responsibilities to the Kosovo leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Before I move on to my second point, let me also add that I completely agree with the observation made by our colleague from Mexico when she referred to Mexico's multi-ethnic background, and how one can, in a sense, live in peace in a country with different ethnic groups. I am pleased to confirm that Singapore too, like Mexico, has a multi-ethnic background, although we do not have 56 ethnic groups. But, as our colleague from Mexico has emphasized, the key is education. I certainly endorse the point that she has made that perhaps UNMIK could look into various means of educating the population and telling them that they can live in a multi-ethnic environment and that they do not have to live in ethnically coherent enclaves.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">Let me now move to my second point. We think that it would be appropriate, especially now, for UNMIK to be treated like any other United Nations peacekeeping operation in terms of management by the Security Council. We understand from reading <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> that the mandate given to UNMIK is for perpetuity, without any formal periodic reviews. By the way, this is rather unique. Every other peacekeeping operation -- in Africa, Asia and, indeed, throughout the world -- always has a formal annual renewal before it proceeds. The case of Kosovo is unique because the operation just goes on in perpetuity.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">We are very puzzled about his, so, actually, we did something unusual. We wrote to some of the members of the Council that were present when the decision was made to create the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo to ask them why they decided to have that perpetuity instead of a regular annual review. Unfortunately, as we all know, the Security Council does not keep records of any kind of explanation for the decisions that are made. But the best answer we got was that, at that time, the members of the Security Council were so relieved that this problem had been transferred from outside the Security Council into the Council that it was decided that, having got hold of it, the Council should keep it in perpetuity.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">But I frankly think that as Kosovo moves towards greater self-government there is a need to have regular reviews for the extension of UNMIK. Indeed, the latest report of the Secretary-General on Kosovo states that</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">"UNMIK is reaching a critical stage in the implementation of its mandate and has made substantial changes in both structure and focus to encourage and support provisional self-government while upholding the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The next phase will require careful management and the continued, strong commitment of the international community." (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2002-62.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/62</a>, para. 44</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">I think that the Security Council clearly needs to be at the centre of the exercise to determine how that is done. One way to do this is through a formal review of the operations of UNMIK, as we do with other peacekeeping operations. That is also a way to ensure that the Council maintains regular oversight and that we impose discipline on a system by ensuring that we have benchmarks to assess how we are progressing.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">That brings me to my third and last point -- a point which I actually raised at the last public meeting on Kosovo, held last November. To be on top of things, the Security Council must also have a clear exit strategy for Kosovo. As we all know, the Council has taken a fundamental decision that exit strategies must always be well managed; the only way to manage them well is to start thinking about them as soon as possible. That has to be done for Kosovo as well, and we hope it will be done reasonably soon.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">Let me emphasize one point to avoid misunderstanding: we are not calling for the quick withdrawal of the international presence in Kosovo. Clearly, UNMIK and KFOR have a lot more to do before the mandate under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> is fulfilled. More important, a precipitate withdrawal would reverse what has been achieved in Kosovo and would squander the resources and efforts expended on the province. Worse still, another conflict could be ignited, destabilizing not only Kosovo but the Balkan region as a whole. Therefore, we emphasize that the international presence in Kosovo must be gradually withdrawn in a way that bolsters and does not undermine the progress that has been painstakingly achieved. But of course, that does not take away from the fact that it would be useful for the Council to know how the international presence would be eventually downsized and eventually withdrawn.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa13">What are the steps forward we can take? What are the benchmarks we need in order to move from one step to the next? What are the rough time frames? What would be the impact on the structure and the size of the Mission? For example, in the context of the latest restructuring of UNMIK, should the benchmark of provisional autonomy be met by some downsizing of the Mission? That is why we emphasize the point about UNMIK devolving some responsibilities to the newly elected Kosovo Government.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa14">Finally, we note also that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> calls on UNMIK to facilitate "a political process designed to determine Kosovo's future status, taking into account the Rambouillet accords" (<i>para. 11 (e)</i>). Those accords, as we know, call for the convening of an international meeting three years after entry into force to formulate a mechanism for a final settlement for Kosovo. The Rambouillet accords were signed on 18 March 1999; the three-year time frame would take us to 18 March 2002, which is about two months from now. Perhaps it would be helpful if we could be enlightened on whether any discussions are taking place on the convening of such an international meeting. I do not know whether Mr. Guéhenno has any information on that point.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">We welcome the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)(<a href="../pdf/S-2002-62.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/62</a>), submitted pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. My delegation also thanks Mr. Guéhenno for his introduction of the report and for his very detailed briefing on the situation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Further, my delegation welcomes the election of a legislature and the subsequent efforts to forge a governing majority in Kosovo. We thank UNMIK for having made internal adjustments for the handover of significant powers to the provisional institutions of self-government and for having ensured that the incoming administration will have a fully funded budget so that it can discharge all of the responsibilities that will fall to it at the end of the United Nations mandate. That would also help ensure security and the establishment of authority.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic wishes also to note its pleasure at the November election of the Kosovo Assembly; we are glad that this was generally considered a success. As the report notes, no party gained enough seats in the Assembly to govern alone, and a coalition must now be formed, bringing together several of the Kosovo parties. That coalition would represent all the sectors and groups in Kosovo in a balanced manner, and would be able to take the reins of self-government. It would carry out legislative and executive functions, ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons, and make sure that security and stability are provided in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">My delegation further welcomes the signing of the Common Document, which will provide a solid foundation for relations between UNMIK and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Because security in Kosovo is a very important issue, we agree with the statement in paragraph 43 of the report that UNMIK and KFOR will do what they can to eliminate weapons and prevent violence. Here, the newly elected Assembly members have a particular responsibility to create conditions conducive to coexistence among the various sectors of the Kosovo population. Those Assembly members must also create conditions conducive to improving inter-communal relations and promoting reconciliation, which must begin in the Assembly in order to set an example for the entire population of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">In that connection, we entirely agree with the representatives of Mexico and of Singapore about the importance of education in bringing together the people of Kosovo so that conflict can be brought to an end.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Let me also mention the question of reviewing the duration of UNMIK's mandate with a view to making a genuine tangible improvement in the lives of the people of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">We pay tribute to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo for its achievements during a critical phase in its mandate. UNMIK is working to encourage and assist with self-government in line with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We agree with the observation in paragraph 44 of the report of the Secretary-General that UNMIK is reaching a critical stage in the implementation of its mandate and that the next phase will require careful management and the continued, strong commitment of the international community.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Belinga-Eboutou</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Allow me at the outset to commend the Secretary-General on his report on the situation in Kosovo. I should like also to pay tribute to the work of the Special Representative, Mr. Haekkerup. I am grateful as well for the update just provided us by Mr. Guéhenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, on the situation. All of this information gives the Council a clear picture of the conditions currently prevailing in Kosovo and will allow it to determine the measures that need to be taken.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">As we consider the report of the Secretary-General on United Nations activities in Kosovo, we cannot but pay heartfelt tribute to all of the components of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), who daily are representing the United Nations in the field and who are working, day after day, to instil peace in the hearts of the people of Kosovo and to create conditions of security for people and for property. They are also carrying out, with skill and dedication, the many indispensable tasks involved in the setting up and smooth functioning of the Interim Administration.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">I think we can say, without lapsing into triumphalism, that the legislative elections held in Kosovo on 17 November last were a great success for the international community. We are indeed gratified to see that all sectors of society participated in them. We welcome the results of the elections, which send the message that a coalition is indispensable for governance. Nor can we fail to experience genuine satisfaction at seeing the atmosphere of peace and security that prevailed during those elections. Indeed, the Under-Secretary-General reminded us of this earlier in his presentation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The smooth holding of the elections has given rise to many expectations as concerns the creation of the necessary institutions and the normalization process. Other important elements have contributed to these hopes. The first was the signing in Belgrade on 5 November last by Mr. Haekkerup and Mr. Covic, Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia, of a Common Document reiterating the principles enshrined in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The second important fact is the anticipated creation of a High-ranking Working Group -- as set out in the Document -- which would serve as a forum for dialogue and cooperation between, on the one hand, UNMIK and the provisional institutions of self-government, and, on the other, the Yugoslav authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">These expectations, like roses, are in danger of living only for one morning unless we attend to them, because the challenges ahead are so great. The events that transpired subsequently -- to which the Secretary-General refers in his report and which Mr. Guéhenno has recalled -- are indeed sources of concern. The difficulties involved in electing a president, the still-tense relations among the inhabitants of Kosovo, the murder that took place on 17 January 2002 -- all of this indicates how fragile, precarious and risk-laden the situation is. This being so, the only possible course is to be vigilant if we wish to capitalize on all of the positive signs that we have noted.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">Indeed, as the Council is aware, many aspects of the task of rebuilding Kosovo have not yet been addressed. We must consolidate the still-fragile achievements that have been registered in the process of Kosovo's renewal.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">A nascent civil administration is gradually being set up; a new multi-ethnic police force is taking its first, as yet unsteady steps; economic networks are emerging, but they still require structure; and finally, the integration of minorities is slowly becoming a reality.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">These achievements are fragile, and we must assist in their preservation and consolidation. We believe that, in order to consolidate this positive momentum, the following points should be given priority attention in our plan of action.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">First of all, we must strengthen security for people and for property. We welcome the joint UNMIK-KFOR activities, which have given the people a sense of security, and we encourage the implementation of the measures contained in paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">Secondly, all armed bands should be disarmed.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">Thirdly, all minorities should be encouraged to return. To that end, we should devise effective follow-up measures as regards integration and security.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa12">We believe that these measures deserve priority attention, insofar as they are aimed at preserving the existence of Kosovo. This requires that the province be integrated into the great family of the Balkans. Its consolidated unity must be maintained as an expression of the commitment of all of Kosovo's components. That unity requires mutual respect, mutual acceptance and tolerance. To live and to survive, Kosovo must internalize and live by the expression e pluribus unum. This is a vast and lofty undertaking, without which there cannot be peace, human rights or democracy in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa13">The United Nations and the relevant and interested regional organizations must endeavour to create, in and around Kosovo, the necessary conditions for a sense of unity to emerge among the various elements of society.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa14">Let me reiterate: e pluribus unum.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa15">I should like to conclude in the same way as I began: by paying tribute to UNMIK, and in particular to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, who has decided, for personal reasons, to leave his post.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diallo</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">The inclusion of the question of Kosovo on the Council's agenda during the first month of the year reflects, in the opinion of my delegation, our constant concern and determination to deepen our consideration and pursue actions undertaken in the context of the implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">In this context, my delegation appreciates the quality of the Secretary-General's report on the evolution of the situation in Kosovo over the past three months. We would also like to thank Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, for the valuable information he has provided on recent events in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">It goes without saying that the year 2001 was marked by major events that have had a positive effect on the province as a whole. The declaration of the Constitutional Framework for provisional Government, and the signing on 5 November of a Common Document between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), as well as the success of the legislative election on 17 November 2001, are some of these achievements.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">This is an opportunity for my delegation to pay a well-deserved tribute to the former Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, and the other members of UNMIK for their work. We also welcome the Secretary-General's decision to appoint a successor to Mr. Haekkerup, and we encourage him to pursue the work begun by his predecessor.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">The calm atmosphere that characterized the legislative elections is a sure harbinger of the democratic development of Kosovo. It also sent a strong signal to the entire region that in the peaceful settlement of conflict elections are more important than weapons. My delegation welcomes the inauguration, on 10 December 2001, of the Kosovo Assembly and the election of its President, Mr. Nexhet Daci. We are also gratified that 35 of the 120 seats in the Assembly were won by minority parties, which, under the Constitution, will assume a responsibility in the future management of the province. The various measures taken for a progressive transfer of power to the provincial authorities are also to be commended. These actions must be supported fully by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">The difficulties related to the election of the President of Kosovo and the formation of the Government arise from the need to form a coalition among the various parties. My delegation encourages the initiatives for negotiations undertaken by UNMIK and other actors and calls upon the various pillars to cooperate more for the sake of the future of the province. The question of security and freedom of movement for minorities remains a great concern, and that is why the efforts of UNMIK and KFOR should be strengthened.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">Efforts to create a climate of security are contingent on the effective implementation of a programme for reconciliation based on tolerance and mutual respect. We urge all the parties to persevere in finding solutions to the humanitarian issues in the province. The signing of the Common Document, which sets out in detail a number of concerns and common interests, is very encouraging in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">In conclusion, my delegation reaffirms its support for the implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The Republic of Guinea will spare no effort in making its modest contribution to the accomplishment of the duty that every one of us is called on to fulfil.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I wish to inform members of the Council that I have just received a letter from the Secretary-General informing me of his intention to appoint Mr. Michael Steiner of Germany as his Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. Arrangements are being made to circulate this letter to the Council members, together with a draft reply to the Secretary-General.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Eldon</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno for what has been another very useful briefing today.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">As Mr. Guéhenno just said, the period under review has covered some very significant achievements and developments in Kosovo, not least among them the November elections and the establishment of the Kosovo Assembly. Moreover, I think that, as others have said, the Council would be remiss if it did not make its thanks clear to Mr. Hans Haekkerup for all he did to bring about those achievements. I would endorse what Ambassador Mahbubani has said about our sadness that he is not with us today to share this occasion, but I am sure congratulations will soon be in order for his successor.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">I am very pleased, Mr. President, that you were able to announce that the Secretary-General's letter concerning Michael Steiner has arrived. Had you not been able to do so, I would have been constrained in my statement to nudge a little, given the importance of making an early appointment, but it is very good to hear that the Secretary-General has nominated Michael. He and I go back a long way together, both here and in our respective postings in Bonn.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The main challenges for the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in 2002 will be to get the new institutions up and running. This will include electing a President and establishing a Government, making progress on the Common Document and taking continued tough action against organized crime and extremism. I would like to cover briefly these three main points this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">With regard to the new institutions, it is vital that the elected members of the Kosovo Assembly put aside their differences and work together for the sake of Kosovo's future. This means electing a President as soon as possible. I would like to say here that building coalitions involves compromise. Those who wish to lead must reach out to others, including the Serb community in Kosovo. The current stalemate within the Assembly cannot continue indefinitely.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">We also welcome UNMIK's efforts, to which Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno has referred, to prepare to hand over functions to the self-governing institutions. We are encouraged to see minority communities taking up jobs in the Assembly's secretariat and in the new civil service. I would like to emphasize once again that it is important that all of Kosovo's people play a full role in shaping the new institutions if they are to fulfil their mission for the future.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">In this context, we have noted the reference in paragraph 30 of the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-62.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/62</a>) to the need to strengthen the UNMIK Close Protection Unit to guarantee a minimum level of freedom of movement to Kosovo Serb Assembly members. We would welcome more details of this requirement in due course.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">As for the Common Document, this is, as Mr. Guéhenno has said, a very significant development. In the Common Document, UNMIK and the Belgrade authorities made clear commitments to address key issues of concern, including refugee returns, missing persons, security and prisoners. We welcome the efforts that have already been made by UNMIK and Belgrade aimed at progress on these issues. These include, on UNMIK's part, the establishment of the Office of Returns and Communities and, on Belgrade's part, granting UNMIK access to Serbian police post-mortem data and evidence. But it is vital that this process of concrete achievement is built on, and it is vital that it is built on fast. The expectations of all the interested parties, including this Council, are, I am sure, very high, and we look to both sides to deliver results.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">We also welcome the meeting of the High-ranking Working Group, which has allowed for some very constructive dialogue on these issues. It is good to hear that a meeting of the Group took place today. Here, again, I want to say that the involvement of Kosovo's elected representatives in the High-ranking Working Group will be crucial if a new relationship with Belgrade is to be established. I hope very much that arrangements can soon be put in place that will allow those elected representatives to take part.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">Finally, Mr. President, the emphasis on organized crime and extremism will come as no surprise to you from British lips. They remain key internal threats to Kosovo. It is very important that Kosovo's elected representatives should speak out against violence and extremism. Ethnically motivated extremism, whether in Mitrovica or Pristina, is totally unacceptable. This kind of thing is the biggest brake there is on Kosovo's development as a democratic society. In addition to the input from the elected representatives, combating these challenges must remain a top priority for UNMIK and KFOR, building on existing progress.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">We welcome the action taken by UNMIK to strengthen the structures of law and order, including through the establishment of new specialized units. It goes without saying that we strongly condemn the murder of Mr. Hajdaraj in Pec on 17 January. Those responsible for his death must be brought to justice.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chen Xu</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">First, we wish to thank the Secretary-General for his report. We also thank the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Guéhenno, for his briefing today.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The smooth holding of Assembly elections throughout Kosovo was an important step in the Kosovo peace process. We express our appreciation to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the other parties involved for their efforts. We are also gratified that the people of Kosovo are actively participating in political life there.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">We remain concerned about the situation in Kosovo after the elections, particularly about the security situation in Kosovo and of the minorities there. The Secretary-General mentioned this in paragraphs 21 and 23 of his report. In this regard, my delegation believes that the observation made by the Secretary-General in his report in paragraph 43 deserves our attention. We hope that UNMIK and KFOR will continue to make efforts, based on those being made.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">We also expect that the parties in Kosovo will set aside their differences and will work together to establish a broad coalition government that will fully reflect the interests of all minority communities. That government should also devote itself to establishing trust among all the communities and bring about national reconciliation, in order to lay the foundation for the economic recovery of Kosovo and long-term stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">UNMIK is working on restructuring and refocusing its work. We hope that all work can be conducted smoothly. We also believe that the Security Council should pay close attention to this process. At this crucial time, the observations and recommendations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be heeded and adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">We concur with the Secretary-General in his opinion that key to the success of the provisional institutions of self-government is the establishment of a professional and multi-ethnic civil service in Kosovo, which should guarantee equal representation of minorities. We hope that transparent and non-discriminatory recruiting policies will be maintained so that minorities will be provided equal recruitment opportunities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">Finally, the Chinese delegation would like to pay tribute to Mr. Haekkerup for his work. We believe that his successor will continue his efforts for the full and comprehensive implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and for the peace process in the region.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Corr</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I would also like to thank Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his briefing this morning and the Secretary-General for the detailed report on the activities of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) since last October. Ireland agrees fully with the statement that will be delivered on behalf of the European Union by the Permanent Representative of Spain later in this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">My delegation would like to express warm appreciation to Mr. Hans Haekkerup for his excellent work during the past year as Special Representative and head of UNMIK. The achievements realized by UNMIK in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, completing the Constitutional Framework and the UNMIK-Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Common Document and holding Kosovo-wide elections bear testament to Mr. Haekkerup's dedication and determination and that of his full team. We are also grateful to Mr. Charles Brayshaw for his interim leadership and wish the new Special Representative, Mr. Steiner, well in his task.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Ambassador Mahbubani rightly made the point earlier in our discussion that Kosovo has been held in trust by the United Nations. With trust comes special responsibility. This trust and responsibility has been fully met in the work of UNMIK and KFOR.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">While the November elections and the inauguration of the Assembly were landmark events, my delegation, like others here this morning, is concerned at the continuing difficulties in electing a President of Kosovo and of forming a government. This delay in establishing self-government and in transferring authority from UNMIK threatens, if it continues too long, to undermine the credibility of the provisional institutions. The democratically elected representatives of Kosovo must work together to ensure that self-government becomes a reality. We encourage UNMIK to continue facilitating meetings between the relevant parties in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">The progress achieved at the municipal level is positive, including the participation of Kosovo Serbs and the other minority groups in local government. Once formed, it is important that the provisional self-governing institutions exercise their new authority in strict compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1244 (1999)</a> and with the Constitutional Framework, cooperate fully with UNMIK and engage constructively with the Belgrade authorities, in accordance with the Common Document. The institutions should be seem by all communities as a legitimate and fair way of representing their interests. For this to happen, as the Secretary-General points out, those elected must use their mandates wisely and reach out to one another in the spirit of mutual respect, tolerance and constructive compromise.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">My delegation welcomes as a key provision of the Common Document the establishment of the High-ranking Working Group as a forum for cooperation and dialogue. We agree with Ambassador Eldon that it is important that the elected representatives of Kosovo participate as soon as possible in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Ireland encourages UNMIK to continue its efforts to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and to further progress in its work in relation to security, justice, refugee returns and missing persons, as well as to further develop its cooperation with the authorities in Belgrade. We welcome the establishment of five new specialized units within pillar I, which should help to intensify the fight against organized crime and terrorism, as well as the gradual increase in the number of trained officers in the Kosovo Police Service.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">We also welcome the establishment of the Office of Returns and Communities within the Special Representative's Office, which should assist in the return and reintegration of displaced persons. As pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report, there has been a particular slowdown of Kosovo Serb returns during the past year. We encourage rapid work on a framework for 2002-2003 that will combine economic incentives and other measures in order to offer longer-term prospects to returnees and other internally displaced persons. The process of displaced persons returning home is central to advancing peace and reconciliation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">The issue of the remaining ethnic Albanian political detainees is particularly important. We hope that, as agreed under the Common Document, their cases can be reviewed according to international standards and that they can be released to UNMIK as soon as possible. Such transfers would do much to improve relations between the two main communities in Kosovo. Ireland is pleased, therefore, to note that this issue is being raised at the High-ranking Working Group meeting in Belgrade today.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">Finally, Ireland believes that the successful development of Kosovo will help to ensure peace and stability in South-East Europe. Along with our partners in the European Union, we will continue to support greater integration and regional cooperation through the Stability Pact and the Stabilization and Association Process.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Franco</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I wish to begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his report and Mr. Guéhenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, for the information he has provided us. This update helps us to understand the scope of the new challenges prevailing in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">We make special reference to Mr. Hans Haekkerup, who intelligently and devotedly led the work of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) for a year. We wish him every success in his future activities. We also take note of the appointment of Mr. Michael Steiner as his successor.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Before proceeding to analyse the information that has been provided, we wish to condemn the recent assassination of the member of the Assembly for the Democratic League of Kosovo. We call on the competent authorities to spare no effort in finding those guilty of the assassination. Now is the time for all political forces to speak as one in condemning the attack and in preventing such violent acts from weakening the efforts of the majority of Kosovars to create a peaceful society.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">The elections for the Kosovo Assembly marked the dawn of a new phase for Kosovo and the international community. The foundations for the work of an administration at a high level of autonomy have now been laid. Gaps and problems remain in the operation of the new administrative structures, but as time goes by these can be overcome. For the moment, what is most important are the good will and commitment of the elected leaders to working to strengthen the new institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">The outcome of the elections should be the very first lesson for the new officials on the new reality in the province and on what the people expect from them. The time is over when majorities prevailed and only the voices of a few could be heard. Henceforth, the greatness of leaders will be measured by their capacity to work as a team, to share decision-making and to consult other political forces, with the future of the province serving as their only lodestar.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">That is why we urge the leaders of the majority parties to continue negotiating to find a way out of the current political crisis and to elect a President and a Government as soon as possible. Only in this way will Kosovo's new administrative structure be able to begin its work. The more time is allowed to pass, the more the problems of the past will dominate the agenda, bring the progress achieved in creating a multi-ethnic Kosovo to a halt.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">Once a new Government has been set up, the administrative structures will acquire their own momentum in their daily operations and the international community, through UNMIK, will be able to continue offering its advice to facilitate the functioning of the new institutions. We believe that this should be the role of the international community. Such advice guarantees direct and detailed follow-up without direct participation in the decision-making process. There are now legitimately elected leaders to assume the responsibility of managing the future of the province, with the kinds of mistakes and successes that occur in any legitimately constituted democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">To conclude, I wish to echo the words of the Secretary-General in paragraph 43 of the report, in which he refers to the particular responsibility of the Assembly members in helping to change the attitudes of the past by openly rejecting violence and terrorism. They must serve as models of reconciliation for the rest of society.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tafrov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I wish at the outset to thank the Secretary-General for his detailed and in-depth report on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his comprehensive briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Bulgaria associates itself with the statement to be made by the Spanish Presidency of the European Union. As mine is the only country of South-East Europe that is a member of the Security Council, I wish to make a few additional comments on behalf of my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">I thank you, Sir, for having organized this open meeting on Kosovo. It is important for the Council closely to follow the situation there at a sensitive and decisive moment in the establishment of viable institutions to include all ethnic communities, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We must bear in mind that the evolution of the political process in Kosovo will have a significant impact on the entire subregion of the western Balkans, in particular on the democratic transition in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia itself and on stability in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">Bulgaria's assessment of the work done by the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, is positive. He was central to the beginning of a genuine political dialogue and democratic process. While thanking him for his work, my delegation is pleased to note that, as we have just learned, the Secretary-General is about to choose a new Special Representative. I would like to take this opportunity to say how pleased my country is at the choice of Mr. Michael Steiner for that post. We believe he has all the necessary qualifications, as well as great experience in the region, which is his own region as well. All this will make it possible for him to carry out his work at this sensitive moment in the implementation of the mandate of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">My delegation welcomes the efforts of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as well as those of all governmental and non-governmental institutions. Those efforts made it possible for the parliamentary elections to succeed, with the participation of all ethnic groups in Kosovo, including the Serbs. The foundations have been laid for the emergence of genuine democratic life and a civil society grounded in respect for human rights and the primacy of the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">On the other hand, the fact that the Kosovo Assembly has placed itself at an impasse that makes it impossible for it to elect a president is a deplorable setback. Bulgaria appeals to the sense of responsibility of all actors in the political process to abandon partisan attitudes so as to provide the international community with, among other things, legitimate interlocutors. That legitimacy will not be complete unless the future Government represents the interests of all ethnic communities of the province without exception. To that end, it is important that all political forces be ready to take on the challenges and responsibilities of administration and government within the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">Bulgaria believes that the presence of UNMIK and KFOR is a decisive element for Kosovo's security. That presence is vitally important, and it must continue. UNMIK has carried out remarkable work in reforming the Mission and transforming the old mixed-administration structures into Transitional Departments that will become ministries as soon as a Government is installed. The progressive transfer of authority to local authorities, who will be solely responsible in the future, is a very important step in transferring responsibility to the elected officials of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">Bulgaria fully supports UNMIK in combating organized crime and terrorism. In that connection, we agree with the analysis presented by the representative of the United Kingdom as regards one of the most serious problems facing Kosovo. We are pleased that the struggle against organized crime has been given priority by UNMIK. We agree with the Secretary-General's assessment as regards the links between organized crime and terrorism, and between regional networks in the Balkans and operations in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">The socio-economic context of "grey" -- not to say "black" -- economy when it comes to trafficking in arms, drugs and young women can endanger the stability of still-fragile institutions and weaken relations between ethnic groups, which are still vulnerable to manipulation by mafia-type groups. My country believes that the only way of breaking the vicious circle of economic and social stagnation, unemployment, criminalization of the economy and the symbiosis between organized crime and ethnic extremism is to fully integrate Kosovo into the economic life of South-Eastern Europe and the continent as a whole. The Bulgarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Solomon Passy, has on several occasions emphasized the need for a genuine revolution in the infrastructures of South-Eastern Europe enabling it to become integrated into the economy of the larger continent and of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">The report of the Secretary-General speaks of the precarious security situation in Kosovo. The murder of the Albanian-speaking member of the Assembly Ismail Hajdaraj on 17 January 2002, which is unambiguously condemned by Bulgaria, merely confirms that concern. My country joins the Secretary-General in appealing to the elected officials of Kosovo to "clearly and openly reject ... terrorism". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2002-62.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/62</a>, para. 43</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa11">It is deplorable that the return of refugees and displaced persons has lost some of its momentum. We believe this is a warning sign of a lack of trust among the ethnic communities that could have very serious consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa12">UNMIK is now at a critical phase in the implementation of its mandate. In the months to come, the Council will have to follow developments very closely and support the Mission's activities. The overall direction of things in Kosovo is no doubt positive, but the process is far from being irreversible. The Council's vigilance remains indispensable.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Levitte</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno for the information he has given us about the situation in Kosovo and the prospects there. Like others, I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Hans Haekkerup for the real successes he achieved in the last year. France welcomes the Secretary-General's announced intention to appoint Mr. Michael Steiner to head the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). We offer him our warmest wishes for every success in his work.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The Permanent Representative of Spain will give a full account of the position of the European Union later in our debate. France fully associates itself with that statement. I shall therefore confine myself at this point to a few brief, additional comments.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Two months ago, on 17 November, Kosovo voters of all ethnic origins elected the 120 members of the Kosovo Assembly. They went to the polls peacefully and in large numbers, thereby demonstrating their sense of responsibility. In so doing they made a decisive contribution to a new stage of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, namely, that of the provisional self-governing institutions. Under the Constitutional Framework, those institutions will gradually take over major UNMIK functions and become responsible for the day-to-day administration of Kosovo. The foundations have therefore been laid for Kosovars themselves to take over the management of their daily lives.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">However, at this point the self-governing institutions are not yet in place, the presidency of the Assembly is not yet complete, and the process of electing a President of Kosovo has not yet been concluded. The Government is therefore not yet constituted. Accordingly, as of today, the devolution of power provided for in the Constitutional Framework has not yet been completed as planned. It is therefore important that Kosovar political leaders live up to the expectations of their peoples by helping to invigorate the provisional self-governing institutions. Those institutions should be established as quickly as possible so that they can fully assume the functions allocated to them by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">In that connection, those elected must quickly name all members of the presidency of the Assembly and elect the President of Kosovo. The active and responsible involvement of the members of the Assembly is required by the spirit of this democratic process: a boycott is no solution.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">I join others in stating our concern at the murder of Mr. Ismail Hajdaraj, a member of the Kosovo Assembly. We condemn that cowardly attack against an elected Kosovar representative. We support UNMIK's efforts to arrest the perpetrators, bring them to justice, discover their motivation and identify their possible backers. We categorically condemn intimidation, violence and attacks against pluralism; under no circumstances can they be tolerated in Kosovo's public life.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">This year again, the fight against insecurity, violence and organized crime will in a general sense be at the centre of UNMIK's concerns. In the interest of Kosovo and of the entire region, it is essential to continue resolute action in that sphere. KFOR and UNMIK -- especially its police and justice pillar -- will continue to be engaged in that work. Kosovar political leaders must lend their full support to ensure the success of this essential activity.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">Another of the priorities for the new year is to expand the dialogue with the Yugoslav authorities, and we earnestly call for this. Here, it is necessary fully to implement the Common Document signed on 5 November by Mr. Haekkerup and Mr. Covic. In that regard, the 18 January Belgrade meeting of the High-ranking Working Group established by that document was a good sign. It would be desirable for representatives of the new elected Kosovar institutions soon to join UNMIK representatives at future meetings. The establishment of pragmatic cooperation on matters of common concern can only be positive. Mutual understanding, inter-ethnic reconciliation and, more broadly, rapprochement of the Balkans with Europe would gain from such cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">In the short term, progress on prisoners and missing persons would be desirable, and it seems to be within our grasp. Kosovar political leaders should speak out clearly and quickly in favour of the return to Kosovo of persons belonging to minorities. Action in that regard would bolster projects undertaken by UNMIK, which we hope will go forward more quickly.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">Michael Steiner is taking on his responsibilities at a crucial time: after the 17 November elections and before the effective establishment of the institutions of provisional self-government. He can count on our full support in his difficult task.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gatilov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">We too are grateful to the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-62.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/62</a>), which contains important information about recent activities of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). We are grateful also to Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno for his introduction of the report.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">In our view, last November's province-wide elections marked a shift to a new phase in the activities of UNMIK. Along with the unexpected need to replace the Head of the Mission, this means that, on the basis of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, we must take complete stock of the situation in Kosovo. We believe that we must all do this together, primarily within the framework of the Security Council, because it is clear that the question of a Kosovo settlement is not the monopoly of the field mission and its leadership. Ensuring success for the entire process requires coordinated efforts among the actors. This would be useful also because it would enable the new Head of the Mission to avoid repeating the grave miscalculations that were allowed to occur under his predecessors.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Clearly, the November elections in Kosovo did not solve all the problems of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. It must be pointed out that even since the beginning of the new year there have been dozens of terrorist acts against Serbs, and that there are still many threats from Albanian extremists. Yet the international presence has not taken new urgent measures to guarantee the security of the Serb community in Kosovo. UNMIK and KFOR must concentrate on providing genuine security and on establishing conditions for the large-scale return of refugees and internally displaced persons to where they previously lived. They must also work to normalize life throughout the province. Of course, the local self-government institutions now being established in the province must be involved in resolving these problems as well.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">Unfortunately, Kosovo continues to be a source of threats both to its immediate neighbours and to the region as a whole. The hotbeds of terrorism and organized crime that developed during the crisis period have not yet been eradicated. That is intolerable. We believe that, together with UNMIK, KFOR must tighten control of the borders between Kosovo on the one hand and Albania and Macedonia on the other in order to stop terrorists from crossing them and to put an end to weapons smuggling.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">We agree with the view widely held among countries involved in the settlement process: that the process of defining the final status of Kosovo should be frozen for some time to come. It is particularly important to develop a system of measures to prevent the self-government structures now being established from becoming a tool with which to fulfil ambitions to gain independence for the province.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">We welcome the determination of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia leadership to cooperate closely with the Security Council, with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and with the international community at large in shaping a multi-ethnic Kosovo. We support the UNMIK leadership in its intention to develop constructive cooperation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities, the foundation for which is to be found in the Common Document signed on 5 November 2001. It is important to help establish direct dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, something that has often been advocated by the leadership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">At this stage, it is not the status of the province that is in the forefront, but rather practical issues of cooperation relating primarily to the economic interdependence of the province and the rest of Serbia. We should make effective use of the High-ranking Working Group as a mechanism for such interaction. The Group began its work last December, which we certainly welcome.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">Still pressing is the issue of the Yugoslav leadership's proposal for the signing of a status-of-mission agreement for UNMIK and KFOR. In that context, we view as a step in the right direction the recent signing by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and KFOR of an agreement on easing the regime governing the Air Safety Zone along the administrative border with Kosovo.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I want to join others in thanking Mr. Guéhenno for his very useful update and also to pay tribute to Hans Haekkerup and to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) for the considerable success that they have achieved under his leadership. We are very glad to hear the news about the appointment of Mr. Steiner to succeed Mr. Haekkerup. He will have the full support of my Government.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">We are, I think, at a critical juncture in the development of Kosovo's self-governing institutions, and this is a key milestone in the road map set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We had very successful and peaceful elections, fostered by UNMIK and others in the international community, that involved all people in Kosovo. That was a significant achievement. Those elections were successful beyond what anyone really could have imagined when UNMIK first arrived in 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">However, things have not proceeded as smoothly since the elections as we might have hoped. Three attempts to form a government have failed, talks have stalled, and a new member of the Democratic Assembly from the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) has been murdered. We condemn this act of violence and call on all of Kosovo's newly elected leaders to show their clear commitment to the democratic process and the rule of law by speaking out against this crime and working together to form a government.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">There will not be room in Kosovo's future for those from any ethnic group who support violence and criminality, or work to undermine the rule of law and the will of the people. I think that the murder of the LDK Assembly member underscores the critical need to have a strong Police Commissioner in place as soon as the incumbent departs on 28 January.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">It is time, I think, for Kosovo's politicians and its people to move on. Of course, we accept that there are bound to be legitimate differences between the parties. This is natural. But it is time to bridge those differences and to move forward in establishing the provisional institutions of self-government. I think that the Secretary-General has it quite right in his report, when he points, in paragraph 43, to the special role and responsibility of the Assembly members themselves in setting an example, in leading and in showing that actual work is possible to promote inter-communal relations and to promote reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">There should be no more patience with obstructionism or with the intimidation of those who would participate. The path ahead can only be one of commitment to democracy and to the rule of law in a multi-ethnic Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">UNMIK has made a great effort to implement the transfer of power and responsibility that the Council laid out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We commend its efforts and call on Kosovo's new leaders to rise to the challenge and to work constructively to build a secure, democratic and better future for all of Kosovo's residents. They must not waste this opportunity.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Spain. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The following countries align themselves with this statement: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">This is the first time this year that the Security Council is dealing with the question of Kosovo. The beginning of a new year is a good opportunity to take stock of the events of the last few months, especially in view of the recent changing of the guard with respect to the post of Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">The European Union wishes to take this opportunity to express its great appreciation to Mr. Hans Haekkerup for his work and for the impetus he has given to institutional development and to the consolidation of democracy in Kosovo. The European Union is pleased to note that Mr. Michael Steiner has now been appointed to replace him. We are certain that his extensive experience in the Balkans will be very useful to him in his new position, and we assure him of the full support of the European Union as he takes on his new responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">The year 2001 was marked by two events of special importance: the promulgation of the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government, and the successful holding of the Assembly elections on 17 November, with the participation of all of Kosovo's communities.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">The signing of a Common Document between the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which marked a new relationship between UNMIK and Belgrade and led to the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and of Serbia urging the Kosovo Serbs to participate in the elections, has also been very important.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">The establishment in May of a new Police and Justice Pillar in UNMIK has significantly enhanced Kosovo's law and order structures.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">The beginning of the year is also a good time to look to the future and to set priorities for 2002. There is no doubt that this year will mark a new stage for Kosovo. The inauguration on 10 December of the Kosovo Assembly was a historic moment for the province. As the Secretary-General said, it was a milestone on the road to democracy. The European Union congratulates all members of the Assembly on taking up their seats, and Mr. Nexhet Daci on his election as President of the Assembly. We urge them to work, within the framework of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and of the Constitutional Framework, for the benefit of all the people of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">The inauguration of the Assembly has set in train the process of provisional self-government and paved the way for the transfer of authority from UNMIK to the new institutions. This will no doubt redound to the benefit of all communities and promote stability in the province, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, which remains the basis for building Kosovo's future.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">The European Union is concerned at delays in the election of the President of Kosovo by the Assembly and the consequent delays in the establishment of the institutions of provisional self-government and in the transfer of authority from UNMIK to those institutions. We appeal to all of the elected representatives to demonstrate responsibility and leadership, so that self-government can become a reality, which will benefit the entire population.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">UNMIK will continue to play an important role in Kosovo. The European Union encourages it to continue to work actively in the areas under the authority of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and to ensure full compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, the Constitutional Framework and other relevant UNMIK regulations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">The European Union was very pleased that the Serbian community finally decided to participate fully in the November elections. We are confident that the Kosovo Serb coalition, as the third-largest force in the Assembly, will become involved in the political life of Kosovo and participate actively in the functioning of the provisional institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">The European Union welcomes the progress made thus far by UNMIK and the Belgrade authorities on the commitments undertaken in the Common Document. Both must continue to progress in its implementation and to make efforts to ensure that cooperation is maintained and consolidated. The new provisional authorities in Kosovo must also demonstrate their commitment to the process. We look forward with interest to the participation of their representatives in future meetings of the High-ranking Working Group, which should serve as a useful instrument to promote political dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa13">As the Secretary-General said on 10 December, it is time to overcome the legacy of the past and consolidate a political culture of tolerance, mutual respect and constructive compromise. UNMIK and KFOR must remain vigilant in ensuring the security conditions necessary so that those already in Kosovo feel sufficiently protected and are able to live in dignity, and so that internally displaced persons feel able to return.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa14">The number of returnees during 2001 was especially discouraging. Fewer than 1,000 internally displaced persons returned to the province. Encouraging minority returns must be a priority for all in Kosovo. We look forward to the framework for 2002/2003, which the recently established Office of Returns and Communities is preparing, working in consultation with the authorities in Belgrade and throughout Kosovo. The international community will also have to support this process if it wishes a significant number of displaced persons to be able to return to Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa15">The issue of the Kosovo Albanian detainees in Serbia is still of particular concern to the European Union. During the last two years, there has been much progress. Out of the 2,000 original detainees, approximately 1,800 have already been released. Some 160 prisoners remain in detention in Serbia. We urge UNMIK and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to agree on a rapid review of all cases involving Kosovo Albanian detainees held in Serbia for offences they are alleged to have committed in Kosovo. Those found not guilty must be released immediately. The European Union urges both Belgrade and UNMIK to make a strong effort to resolve this issue, under the auspices of the Common Document, in the first quarter of this year.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa16">We agree with the Secretary-General's assessment that security and freedom of movement for Kosovo's minority communities remain a serious concern, despite the slight improvement in the last few months. We encourage UNMIK and KFOR to continue to do their utmost to improve security, and we urge all political leaders in the province to make every effort possible to put an end to violence.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa17">Organized crime and extremism continue to pose significant threats to Kosovo as well as to the stability of the surrounding region. The European Union commends UNMIK for progress in strengthening the structures of law and order, but is aware that much remains to be done to combat organized crime and extremism effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa18">The EU strongly condemns the murder last Thursday, 17 January, of Kosovo Assembly member Ismail Hajdaraj, and urges all members of the Assembly to show a spirit of maturity and responsibility in addressing this new episode of violence. The provisional institutions of self-government must share with UNMIK a special responsibility in confronting the ongoing scourge of political and ethnic violence that obstructs Kosovo's path towards a multi-ethnic society. A new spirit of cooperation is needed in this area and in the struggle against organized crime and terrorism, which are priority concerns for the European Union in the province and the surrounding region.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa19">Finally, the Stabilization and Association Process, launched by the European Union, and the Stability Pact both seek to enhance the sense of regional responsibility and to promote regional cooperation. The European Union attaches great importance to its own efforts to support democracy, ethnic coexistence, peaceful relations among neighbours and regional cooperation. We firmly believe that these are the goals to which we all aspire in the Balkans.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sahovi</span> <span class="nation">Yugoslavia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">Before addressing the item on the agenda, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the newly elected members of the Council and to wish them every success in discharging their duties in the next two years.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">My delegation would also like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report and to thank Mr. Guéhenno for his, as always, comprehensive report.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">When the Security Council last met to review the situation in Kosovo and Metohija, all of the participants in the debate expressed satisfaction at the fact that the province-wide elections took place in a peaceful and democratic atmosphere. There was a sense of cautious optimism around this table about the prospects for the future. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shared the view that an important step forward had been taken. We maintained the position that it was of crucial importance for Kosovo and Metohija to make sure that its democratically elected representatives established provisional institutions of self-government and commenced work.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">However, today, two months later, these institutions, charged with the task of addressing everyday problems besetting Kosovo and Metohija with the joint and equal participation of representatives of all ethnic communities, have not yet begun their work. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia regrets that fact, in particular because the self-government institutions are envisaged as a significant element in the process of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and an important part of a mechanism to establish confidence within Kosovo and Metohija society. Elected representatives must justify the trust bestowed on them and prove that they are ready and able to address the difficulties that continue to plague Kosovo and Metohija.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">Indeed, the difficulties are many. My Government is deeply concerned over the lack of security in Kosovo and Metohija, particularly for non-Albanians. This concern has been expressed repeatedly in the Secretary-General's reports, including the report now before us. Numerous incidents, including murders of both Serbs and Albanians, the planting of explosive devices, and intimidation are unfortunately still standard items in the news coming from Kosovo and Metohija. A few weeks ago, a prominent Serb was killed in front of his house in Kosovska Kamenica. Last week, another tragic event occurred when a newly elected Albanian member of Parliament was killed in Pec. We condemn these acts. Such an environment is not compatible with the efforts to improve the overall situation and hinders the work of the provisional institutions. Security for all is a prerequisite for the successful functioning of these institutions and the inclusion of Serbs and other non-Albanians in their work.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">Unfortunately, the international presence in the province is still unable to ensure security and occasionally faces setbacks, as in the recent release of the two suspects in the case of the terrorist attack on a passenger bus near Podujevo last February. A year after dozens of Serbian internally displaced persons, including women and children, were killed and wounded -- and at a time when the international community is mobilizing unprecedented resources to combat terrorism around the world -- the perpetrators of this blatant terrorist act remain at large in the area administered and controlled by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR. We strongly condemn this fact.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">In addition to continuous security problems, there are other very important outstanding issues, such as the stalemate in the process of the returns of internally displaced persons and the tracing of missing and abducted persons. They need to be addressed urgently, in cooperation with UNMIK, KFOR and the competent Yugoslav authorities on the basis of the Common Document of last November, as well as with provisional self-government institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">My Government has been a determined partner of the international community in tackling these and other issues in order to achieve the common goal of a multi-ethnic, multireligious and multicultural Kosovo and Metohija. Along these lines, we have made an important contribution to the process of voter registration and the preparation and holding of elections. We are very appreciative of the contribution made to the process by KFOR and UNMIK. We also highly value the message of the international community, including the Security Council, sent before the elections, that violence, as a means of achieving political goals, will not be tolerated in Kosovo and Metohija and that the elections will not affect its final status. After all, this is provided for by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the Common Document.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">That Document is important not only as a good basis for the development of fruitful cooperation between my country and the United Nations Mission, but also for the resolution of a series of concrete issues listed there. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia expects, as a priority in the coming period, that it will be fully and consistently implemented. The continued attention and support of the Security Council in this process is essential.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">Progress in this and other aspects of cooperation between my country and UNMIK would be greatly facilitated by the conclusion of a status-of-mission agreement. In addition to being an important new step in the partnership between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the international community, a status-of-mission agreement would resolve a number of technical and other issues in the functioning of UNMIK in a much more effective way and would make the lengthy practice of taking separate decisions on every individual issue obsolete. There is no doubt that the agreement would facilitate UNMIK activities and would contribute to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, let me acknowledge the role that Mr. Hans Haekkerup played as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Kosovo and Metohija and as Head of UNMIK. Over the past year, important developments took place in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. His contribution to that process was significant, including in strengthening and improving the relations between Yugoslavia as the host country and UNMIK. I thank Mr. Haekkerup for all his efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa12">My Government looks forward to close cooperation with the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Steiner, who we just heard is to be appointed, in addressing many challenges that we are facing in the ongoing process of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Ukraine. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the very responsible duties of the presidency of the Security Council in the month of January. I would also like to wish you and your team every success. We would also like to warmly welcome the newly elected members of the Council and wish them further creative inspiration.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">We would like to join previous speakers in expressing our thanks to Under-Secretary-General Guéhenno for his, as usual, very comprehensive update on the latest developments in Kosovo and activities of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). It was with great regret that we learned about the decision of Mr. Hans Haekkerup to leave the post of Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the province. We wish him every success in his new endeavours. We hope that Mr. Haekkerup's successor, Mr. Michael Steiner, will bring the necessary inspiration in order to carry out the aims of the international community in Kosovo, and we pledge our full cooperation with the new Head of the United Nations Mission in the province.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Ukraine supports the statement made by the representative of Spain on behalf of the European Union. We share the general vision of the situation on the ground and endorse the key messages brought out by our European colleagues.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">The two months that have passed since the general elections in Kosovo have been marked by important results in UNMIK activities. As was outlined in the report of the Secretary-General and the presentation of Mr. Guéhenno, concerted efforts were made to ensure the stable work of the newly elected Kosovo Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">My delegation is particularly satisfied with the prudent approach taken by UNMIK to promote the political and power-sharing dialogue in the framework of the Parliament, as well as to ensure the security of its members and staff. We support UNMIK's internal adjustments for handing over powers to the provisional institutions of self-government and the intensive steps made to restructure the Mission and transform the former Joint Interim Administration Structure.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">Of no less significance is the implementation of other UNMIK priorities, in particular further steps to create the conditions necessary for the sustainable return of internally displaced persons and refugees. In this context, we welcome the developments in the Osojane valley, where the first phase of an integrated programme to ensure the sustainability of returns was completed in December.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">My delegation also notes UNMIK's activities aimed at reducing ethnically targeted crimes and its success in developing the Kosovo Police Service. Progress in the fight against terrorism and organized crime deserves our appreciation as well.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">Two months after the parliamentary elections, a difficult test for the Kosovo leaders has appeared. Concerned about the recent failures to finalize the composition of the presidency and to elect the President of Kosovo, Ukraine calls upon all political forces to streamline these efforts, thus proving their readiness to contribute to the democratic transformation of the region. We believe that it is not in the interest of any Kosovo political force to block these processes, thus discouraging hopes of ensuring productive work of the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">Another vital issue is the security conditions in the region, which remains a matter of grave concern. My delegation strongly condemns the brutal murder of one of the members of the Assembly, who was shot to death on 17 January. It is our firm belief that any acts of violence in the province, as well as any threats directed against members of the democratically elected Parliament, are absolutely inadmissible and should not be tolerated. We believe that UNMIK will do its utmost to apprehend the assailants.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">From our standpoint, further progress in the political recovery process of Kosovo will depend on three major factors. The first is that there will be no visible breakthrough unless the democratically elected leaders take their own share of responsibility for political and economic transformation in the province, while exercising their authority, in strict observance of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">Secondly, we share the view of the Secretary-General that the next phase of UNMIK's activities will require the strong commitment of the international community. However, in our opinion, further international involvement in the situation in Kosovo should be based on a single and clear political strategy that has to be determined by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa12">Thirdly, lasting political recovery in Kosovo can be achieved only through enhanced and strengthened dialogue between Yugoslav and provincial authorities. We believe that such cooperation will give a necessary impetus to inter-ethnic reconciliation in the whole region.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Ukraine for his kinds words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Mauritius.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa03">We would like to join previous speakers in thanking Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno for introducing the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and for his comprehensive and very useful briefing this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa04">We congratulate the people of Kosovo on the successful organization of the elections in their province. We hope that the Assembly members will soon elect their President and that the provisional institutions of self-government can assume full responsibility over areas under their authority. This is a very crucial moment, when members of the Assembly need to work constructively in a spirit of patriotism. We call on them to show a stronger sense of compromise and dialogue and to agree on the choice of the President of Kosovo. The sooner the President is appointed, the better it will be, because the institutions of provisional self-government have to start operating soon. Long and arduous work lies ahead of the Assembly members to shape the future of their province.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa05">We commend UNMIK for the excellent work it is doing to support the Assembly in avoiding any legislative vacuum. We encourage the team for the efficient manner in which it is operating. We also understand that, once the provisional self-government is in place, UNMIK will hand over authority to it, while retaining some competencies for the Special Representative, as specified in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa06">The issue of the security of minority communities remains a priority at this point in time so as to encourage them to return to their homeland. It is noted that only 2,432 out of the 229,900 registered internally displaced persons have returned to their homes in Kosovo. Much work needs to be done to activate the return and reintegration of these displaced persons. While UNMIK and KFOR are carrying out their duties of ensuring the safe return of the internally displaced persons and refugees, we call on the political leaders to create the necessary conditions to accelerate the return of the minority communities to the province.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa07">The return of internally displaced persons and refugees will also depend on the availability of the proper infrastructures and the restoration of public utilities and community services in the province. This will no doubt need further assistance from donors and, in that regard, we urge donor communities to enhance their support for the various projects that are being carried out in Kosovo. The region, which is one of the poorest in Europe, urgently needs investment for sustained economic recovery.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa08">Mauritius has repeatedly highlighted in its previous statements that the security situation in the Mitrovica region remains a challenge which should be tackled with great care if we do not want a crumbling of the whole process of peacemaking in Kosovo. UNMIK has still not been able to fully enforce its authority in that area, where the security situation continues to be fragile. It is also a matter of concern that KFOR members continue to be assaulted while on duty in that part of the province. We reiterate our call on the Serb political leaders to bring their influence to bear on their supporters for the unhindered operations of UNMIK and KFOR in the Mitrovica region. We also encourage the posting of Kosovo Serb officers of the Kosovo Police Service to the northern part of the province so that the people of Mitrovica will show less hostility to the police force and allow the proper enforcement of law and order.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa09">Mauritius welcomes the setting up of the specialized units by UNMIK pillar I (police and justice) to combat organized criminal activities and terrorism in the province. We encourage UNMIK and KFOR to step up search operations, especially along the borders, so as to limit the smuggling of weapons to armed groups. We hope that the re-entry of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into Interpol will ensure closer police cooperation between Pristina, Belgrade and other States in the region in order to bring down the level of crime and other illegal activities and contribute towards regional stability.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa10">Like other speakers before us, we condemn the murder of the Democratic League of Kosovo member of the Assembly and we equally condemn the bomb attack on the home of a Kosovo Albanian, injuring a pregnant woman and a child. These irresponsible acts must be reprehended and those responsible must be brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa11">The problem of detainees and missing persons is a crucial factor in the building of confidence between Albanians and Serbs. This seems to have achieved some progress, especially following the signing of the Common Document between UNMIK and Belgrade. We note with satisfaction that UNMIK will soon open a sub-office of the Missing Persons Unit in Belgrade and that it will be granted full access to post-mortem data collected by the Serbian police. We also consider the protocol on joint verification teams on hidden prisons, though still in the drafting stage, to be a very positive step forward. The handing over of Albanian detainees from Serbia to UNMIK will further help to build confidence in the relations between Pristine and Belgrade.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa12">It is up to the new Government of Kosovo to rise to the challenge of building a democratic, secure and multi-ethnic Kosovar society, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. I should like to echo the words of the representatives of Mexico and Singapore when they mentioned the importance of education in trying to build a multi-ethnic society. Mauritius is another multi-ethnic society where education has certainly helped to establish better harmony between the different ethnic groups.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa13">Finally, we would like to pay tribute to the important work carried out by Mr. Hans Haekkerup as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of the Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. We would like to express our best wishes to his successor, Mr. Michael Steiner.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa14">I now resume my function as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa15">I now give the floor to Mr. Guéhenno to respond to the comments made and questions raised.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guéhenno</span> <span class="non-nation">Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I would first like to thank the members of the Council and the representatives of Spain, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Ukraine for paying tribute to the achievements of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) under the leadership of Hans Haekkerup. Their words of appreciation will be conveyed to him.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">Indeed, the work that was accomplished in 2001 helped build the foundations on which we now have to work. The provisional institutions of self-government give a framework within which the various communities of Kosovo can learn to work together and to live with each other. The specific results of the election impose a compromise and that is a good thing because it is a basis for any sustainable Kosovo. The Common Document, as the Ambassador of Yugoslavia pointed out, offers a good framework for relations not only between the United Nations and Yugoslavia, but also between the Kosovars and the authorities in Belgrade. All that now needs to be implemented and to be developed.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa03">I was briefly in Kosovo at the beginning of this month, and I made clear to the leaders of Kosovo that they now have to live up to the expectations of the international community and that their own people would not understand if the institutions that have been developed were to remain empty shells. That is really the challenge at hand now. It will require a continued and sustained effort on the part of the international community, which I think will see the participation of Kosovars in those institutions as a test. How can one envisage any final status if the Kosovars cannot agree to make provisional institutions work? It is therefore very important that they deliver on that. No scheme devised in an international conference will work if the people on the ground do not have the right mindset to implement whatever scheme is agreed. In that respect, the top-down approach has to be complemented by a bottom-up approach.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa04">For UNMIK and for Mr. Steiner it means that the programme of work will indeed be quite heavy in the month to come. It is necessary to engage the leaders of Kosovo and the communities at all levels so that they address the practicalities of the future of Kosovo. There is the need to build capacities in Kosovo. Some members of the Council have stressed the importance of education in that respect. I would like to say that significant efforts have been made for the transfer of authority to the future Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. The present transitional Education Department is recruiting staff from all communities for the future Ministry. We understand that it is important that all communities -- including, of course, Kosovo Serb students -- have access to higher education, and I think an understanding has been reached in that respect with the authorities in Belgrade. At the same time, we do not believe that a parallel education system should be developed. This has to be an integrated policy. I would also like to inform the Council that the transitional Education Department is working on the development of a multilingual curriculum, which will have to be finalized with the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa05">There is the need to build capacities, but there is also the need for the Mission to focus on some key priorities that are of the essence for the success of the political strategy. In that respect I would like to say a few words on another item that was raised by several delegations, namely, the issue of security. Indeed, security in Kosovo remains a concern. We are not satisfied with incidents like the one reported in paragraph 23 of the report, when individuals are arrested in possession of weapons, for instance. Unfortunately, that is still a regular occurrence in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa06">The Mission is working hard to address the security issues. It is working hard to address politically motivated crime, as well as organized crime. I would like to stress the five priorities in the fight against organized crime that have been defined by the Mission: fighting against prostitution and trafficking, against money-laundering and economic crimes, against racketeering and extortion, against terrorism, and against the illegal possession of weapons and trafficking in weapons and ammunition. This fight against organized crime is a key priority for pillar I of the mission. It will include the further development of further legislative and institutional tools, in addition to what has already been developed. The anti-economic crime unit in the economic reconstruction pillar will work closely with pillar I to address the economic crime issues, which are very much linked to the sustainability, so to speak, of crime activities.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa07">Another area that is a key concern of the Mission in the field of security is, of course, the security of Assembly members. The Kosovo Police Service (KPS) has already trained 96 officers to provide close protection to Assembly members. That division of the Kosovo Police Service will be expanded in 2002 to provide security service to all the ministries of the provisional institutions. The first KPS close protection teams will be operational next month, with a target of 180 close protection officers by the middle of this year. There is an urgent need to incorporate at least 20 international close protection officers into the UNMIK Close Protection Unit to strengthen the effectiveness of that Unit and to provide for the freedom of movement of Kosovo Serb Assembly members.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa08">Another important area in the provision of security is of course the control of borders, to which the Russian representative referred. It is indeed close to impossible to hermetically seal any border, but I want to report to the Council that UNMIK and KFOR are making every effort to control Kosovo's borders and boundaries. Search operations continue along the borders and boundaries, targeting extremists, organized crime and weapon-smuggling. In that respect, I would like to mention a major operation that took place on 1 December 2001, when KFOR and UNMIK police launched the largest simultaneous weapons-search operation thus far. That operation involved 3,000 soldiers from all the multinational brigades. The operation resulted in some arrests and the seizure of an assorted range of weaponry. In close cooperation with KFOR, we will continue to develop the effort to reassure the people of Kosovo that law-abiding persons, who are the vast majority of the people of Kosovo, feel secure in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa09">Beyond the issue of security, as UNMIK focuses on its key functions and some key targets to provide for a good political environment, in the course of the next 12 months UNMIK will have to address the issue of its reshaping. Already we see that pillar II, the civil administration pillar, has witnessed a significant reduction in its personnel while pillar I is being strengthened precisely to strengthen the rule of law and the provision of security and a functioning judiciary, which is a key political concern.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa10">We expect the new Special Representative to focus a lot on the reshaping of UNMIK in a number of areas from an executive role to an advisory role, thus rebalancing the various pillars to address the remaining priorities of the Mission. The restructuring will certainly affect pillar III and, eventually, pillar IV, as it has affected pillar II. So I see the internal organization of the Mission as certainly being one of the important tasks of the new Special Representative.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa11">I think, given the lateness of the hour, that I will end by emphasizing that a lot has been accomplished, but that a lot remains to be done. At the moment, the strategy is really to test the will of the Kosovar people by engaging them, so that the provisional institutions organized last year can function. That will provide a sound basis for future discussion on the status of Kosovo.</p>
