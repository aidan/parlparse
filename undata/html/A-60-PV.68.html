	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa01">We deeply regret that the Second Committee has once again become a political platform for advancing one-sided, unbalanced and inaccurate information regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa02">The Second Committee has a vital responsibility before it. Addressing issues that neither enhance our work nor provide pragmatic solutions to the conflict are of no service to any party. The resolution just adopted represents an abuse of the mandate of the Second Committee. It is unfortunate that those who adhere to a myopic, singular political agenda continue to suppress its important priorities and exploit this forum. Ultimately, the important ideals that this institution aspires to serve -- integrity, fairness and effectiveness -- are likewise undermined.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa03">Israelis and Palestinians have an important process in place, agreed upon by the Quartet, by which the two parties will engage in direct bilateral negotiations in pursuit of a lasting peace agreement. The resolution just adopted undermines those efforts and prejudges issues to be addressed in those negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa04">As in past years, Israel voted against this biased and counter-productive resolution.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk03-pa02">And once again, we have listened as the representative of the occupying authorities ignored the opinion of the international community, despite the fact that the vast majority of delegations voted in favour of the resolution, which received 156 votes in favour. That strong support reflects the international community's commitment to achieving peace based on decisions and resolutions of international legitimacy and its deep concern with respect to grave Israeli practices, including the use of the natural resources belonging to the Syrian Golan and the occupied Palestinian territories. Those practices deprive the inhabitants of the resources of those areas. The resolution also transmits the international community's concern at the fact that the occupying Power is dumping various kinds of waste materials that are harmful to the environment in the occupied Arab territories and its concern at the impact of that dumping on the environment and on the health of the Arab civilian population living under the yoke of the occupation.</div>

Through that action, the international community reaffirms its commitment to international law and the rights established under that law. The adoption of the resolution also sends a clear message to the Palestinian people, whose rights and resources remain under seizure by the occupying Power, that the international community stands with them and their inalienable right to a life of dignity and prosperity, in which their natural resources are employed for their benefit.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa03">Additionally, the adoption of the resolution demonstrates the international community's overwhelming support for holding all States to the same standards and the same responsibilities, clearly demonstrating that no Member of the Organization is above international law and covenants.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa04">A people's permanent sovereignty over its natural resources is part and parcel of its inalienable right to self-determination as established by international law, and it must be safeguarded by the international community in the interest of peace and stability. The resolution just adopted, which gained the support of the international community, provides such legal and moral protection.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Claiming that these resolutions are irrelevant is an assault on the will of the international community, which has repeatedly tried to uphold international law and the principles for which this Organization stands. The adoption of this resolution is repeated annually only because of the belligerence of the occupying Power. If this action is irrelevant to the principles of the United Nations and the obligations of its Members, what, then, is relevant?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa06">Those accusations reflect the bankruptcy of the accuser, which has run out of all excuses and justifications for continuing to snub the international community and the laws by which that community lives. The United Nations is for all its Members, and the resolutions adopted by its Members are relevant because they represent the will of Members, who constitute the United Nations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa02">The United States opposes the draft resolution. It serves as a direct challenge to the prerogative of sovereign States to conduct their commercial relations freely. Every sovereign State has the right to decide with whom it will or will not trade. Member States should understand, moreover, that the draft resolution is aimed at undermining the international community's ability to respond effectively to acts that by their very nature and enormity are offensive to international norms. There must be consequences for such actions; otherwise, offending States will have no incentive or reason to abandon them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa03">Unilateral and multilateral economic sanctions can be an effective means to achieve legitimate foreign policy objectives. They constitute an influential diplomatic tool. The United States is not alone in holding that view or in following that practice. The United Nations Charter itself provides for the use of sanctions to change the behaviour of those who would challenge, or seek to undermine, international norms.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa04">It should be remembered that not too long ago, the unilateral and multilateral economic sanctions imposed on the racist regimes in South Africa and in what was then Rhodesia underscored the international community's solidarity with the people of those countries, who were fighting for their dignity and freedom. Through those steps, positive change was realized.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk05-pa05">It is therefore a question not of so-called coercion against developing countries, but of extending a hand of support to their peoples when their Governments have coerced them.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa01">The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like to reaffirm the position of President Chavez with regard to the outcome document of the 2005 summit (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf">resolution 60/1</a></i>). That document was the result of a process of consultations that was neither democratic nor transparent. The negotiating process, which concluded in September, was unworthy of the intergovernmental character of the Organization and did not live up to its principle of the sovereign equality of States. Given those circumstances, the document did not meet the development expectations of our countries and States and failed to guarantee respect for the sovereign right to self-determination, national independence and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa02">The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has historically stood by small island developing States in their aspirations to development and prosperity, and in recent years we have joined a number of multilateral and regional cooperation mechanisms. At the multilateral level, we have joined with other countries of the South in carrying out activities in response to their particular needs. We would also like to express our solidarity with the small island developing States in the context of the natural disasters to which they have so often been subjected. Our commitment to and solidarity with them will remain unflagging.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa03">My delegation did not oppose the consensus on draft resolution II. However, the resolution makes reference to the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. My country has expressed reservations about paragraphs 26 and 27 of the Strategy, since they make explicit reference to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which contains provisions relating to the delimitation of maritime boundaries -- a Convention to which we are not party. We reiterate, therefore, that, under international customary law, the norms established by that Convention are not applicable to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, apart from those it explicitly recognizes or may recognize in the future by incorporating them into its domestic legislation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa04">My delegation did not oppose the consensus on the adoption of the draft resolution. But given the references to the 2005 Summit Outcome and to the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela dissociates itself from those paragraphs of the resolution that refer to those documents.</div>

It welcomes a positive planned step by a Member, while not ignoring that Member's reprehensible actions in the same regard. Omitting a reference to the actions giving rise to concern while praising a step in the planning would send the wrong message, regardless of the Member involved. Hence, this is a matter of principle, not attitude, as some have suggested. What the draft resolution achieves is balance and genuineness, rather than imbalance.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk03-pa01">Israel is a known leader in research on desertification and land degradation. The Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Research, in the Negev region, where the international conference we are hosting will take place, is considered to be among the world's top institutions in this field. Israel's initiative to include language welcoming that international conference, to be held in cooperation with other Member States, academic institutions and the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification was motivated by our desire to take part in raising public awareness of desertification and land degradation and to share our proven experience and expertise in that field as part of the celebrations of the International Year, all for the benefit of the international community, in particular the countries affected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk03-pa02">It is regrettable that a handful of delegations -- or rather, one delegation in particular -- sabotaged a straightforward resolution and the technical issue it represents, with utter disregard for the importance of the issue at hand, all for the sake of making a political point.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk03-pa03">Israel believes that such contemptible manoeuvres should be continually challenged, especially in the General Assembly Hall, and rejected. It is for that reason that we called for a separate vote on the fourth preambular paragraph of the resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk03-pa04">We would like to convey our appreciation to those delegations which have supported us in that initiative and to those which have opposed the politicized amendment, thus sending the right message to the amendment's initiators. I can promise you, Mr. President, and all members that, despite the efforts to discriminate against it, Israel will continue to be proactively and positively involved in the work of the General Assembly, in particular in areas where it can contribute, based on its knowledge and experience, to addressing the issues at the top of the global agenda.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk04-pa01">Syria voted against the draft resolution on the International Year of Deserts and Desertification for one simple reason: one delegation's politicization of the issue. That was also why Syria voted against the seventh preambular paragraph. That paragraph notes that the Israeli occupation authorities will hold an international conference entitled "Deserts and desertification". Israel's convening of the conference is intended to deceive the international community in an act of hypocrisy and persuade it of Israel's contribution to combating desertification at the regional and international levels. But in fact, the Israeli authorities are exacerbating desertification and environmental degradation in the occupied Arab territories of Palestine and Syria. Consider what Israeli tanks and war machinery are doing to the land and the environment of the occupied Palestinian territories in particular.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk04-pa02">Numerous reports of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly note that Israel is carrying out many activities in occupied Arab lands that contribute to the degradation of the soil, such as uprooting trees and destroying wells used by Arab farmers. Israel also draws a large volume of underground water, affecting the area's river courses. Through those practices, Israel is destroying the environment of the occupied Arab territories. Further, it is burying nuclear and toxic wastes from Israeli industrial sites. The resolution just adopted and the resolution on the permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources, both clearly and frankly reflect the international community's deep concern at those Israeli practices.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk04-pa03">Syria welcomes the retention of the fourth preambular paragraph, proposed by the Arab Group, concerning Israeli practices in the occupied Palestinian territories. Syria reaffirms its support for all that is set out in the resolution on the International Year of Deserts and Desertification, in particular its welcoming of the conference on the protection of deserts and combating desertification, to be held by the friendly State of Algeria.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk04-pa04">Our vote on this draft resolution was due to one simple reason: the seventh preambular paragraph's politicization of the issue. That is not at all in line with the principal objective of the International Year of Deserts and Desertification.</div>
