	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti, documents <a href="../pdf/S-1997-832.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/832</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1997-832-Add.1.pdf" class="nolink">S/1997/832/Add.1</a>.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lelong</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">At the close of your mandate as President of the Security Council for the month of November, during which you have demonstrated your sterling qualities, I wish, Sir, to congratulate you warmly on behalf of my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH), which was established for a four-month period by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1123(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1123 (1997)</a> of 30 July 1997, is coming to an end. The mandate of UNTMIH was to help the Haitian authorities professionalize the Haitian national police, and it did an outstanding job and made a substantial contribution to strengthening an institution that is of great importance to the progress of democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I take the opportunity presented by his departure to pay tribute to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Enrique ter Horst, for his effectiveness and dedication, which contributed to the success of the Mission. I also thank the commanders of the military forces and of the civilian police and the entire staff of UNTMIH for their efforts in support of democracy in Haiti. We convey our profound gratitude to all the countries that participated in the Mission or in various ways facilitated its full success, notably Canada and the United States, which have made special efforts in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">When in March 1995 United Nations troops first arrived in Haiti to take over from the multinational force, the people and the Government of Haiti were facing an enormous challenge. We needed to rehabilitate a country that had been completely devastated, that was in the throes of an unbridled lack of security and whose institutions were failing -- sometimes, indeed, non-existent.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Thanks to the climate of peace and security that United Nations personnel helped to maintain, there was major progress in many areas. Haiti regained stability. Once reformed, existing institutions began to work again, and new institutions were born. We are making progress towards building a State based on the rule of law. In his letter dated 29 October 1997 addressed to the Secretary-General, the President of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. René Préval, stressed the decisive role played by the Organization in the maintenance of stability and security in our country, and its support for the consolidation of democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">With the departure of United Nations military forces, the Haitian National Police will alone shoulder responsibility for maintaining order and security. That institution, born barely two years ago to replace a corrupt, brutal army, has benefitted from the contribution of United Nations personnel in the areas of training and professionalization. Recent progress reports have shown that the Haitian National Police has made significant progress in certain decisive areas. But there is concern at the gap between the professionalization and growing integration of the police on the one hand and the pace of progress in the sphere of justice on the other; this can certainly lead to frustration among the people. The Haitian National Police needs international assistance to continue its own institutional development while also doing its job of maintaining security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">That is why, in his letter, President Préval requested the assistance of a civilian police mission to help with police training, which would make it possible for this institution -- indispensable for the establishment of a State truly based on the rule of law -- to experience balanced, smooth and prompt development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">As everybody knows, not all the problems facing Haiti have been resolved. The lack of security, linked to banditry and drug trafficking, continues to claim victims. The economy has not yet seen the recovery we had hoped for, and the living conditions of all Haitians have continued to deteriorate, with absolute poverty gaining ground despite the Government's efforts to remedy the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Here we must stress that the firm determination to eliminate the vestiges of a regime of terror based on practices of domination, repression and monopoly that were at once anachronistic and sophisticated and to build a new social order cannot be limited to access by the majority to citizenship through the building and strengthening of democratic institutions. This endeavour requires that the population -- the majority of which is without the benefits of twentieth-century progress -- enjoy the material and spiritual conditions that lead to a life of dignity. This is difficult because of the vast gap between available resources and the enormous, ever-present demands that are becoming ever more urgent with the achievement of political freedoms. Integrated and sustainable development is an essential element for the stability of our country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">At this stage in our national reconstruction, the Haitian people continues to count on the support of the international community, which has already made considerable efforts for the restoration of democracy to Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">For all these reasons, my delegation would ask the Security Council to adopt the draft resolution before it unanimously.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Haiti for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Argentina. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Petrella</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">At the outset, Mr. Qin Huasun, let me congratulate you on the outstanding manner in which you have guided the work of the Security Council during an intensely busy month. This is no surprise given your experience and the prominence of your country in world affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The draft resolution before the Council today would renew international assistance in the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti. As the Secretary-General notes in his comprehensive report, he received a letter dated 29 October 1997 from the President of Haiti requesting continued United Nations support for the process that is under way. Accordingly, Argentina, which is committed to the defence of democracy and institutions, considers it necessary to give its express support for a continued United Nations presence in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">We know that to achieve the consolidation of a State's institutions, international assistance in itself is not a solution. The determination of all the political forces of Haiti is a necessary condition, as is the achievement of a general framework for international assistance that enables sustainable development to take place.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">On this occasion, we once again express our thanks to all of the members of the Security Council for continuing to hold to their commitment to institutional consolidation in Haiti. In particular, we are grateful for the understanding shown by China and the Russian Federation in translating into reality a continuing United Nations presence in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The mandate of the Mission that is being established by the draft resolution to be voted on faces the same difficulties as the missions previously deployed in Haiti. For that reason, we attach special importance to the United Nations capacity for dialogue on the ground. Accordingly, we believe that maintaining an appropriate level of representation by the United Nations will be conducive to the success of that mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">Finally, we wish to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Enrique ter Horst, for the dedication and professionalism with which he has carried out his functions.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Argentina for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Canada. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">I am pleased to take the floor today as the Security Council considers a draft resolution establishing a United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH), an entirely new Mission which is clearly adapted to Haiti's special circumstances. The members of the Council are hereby sending a very positive and encouraging message to the Haitian people and their Government, a message that we strongly endorse.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">Canada believes that the United Nations and the Security Council in particular can contemplate the completion of the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) with some measure of satisfaction. Canadian military personnel have spoken warmly of their experiences with this Mission and of their excellent relations with the Haitian people. As this Mission -- one of Canada's most important military operations in recent years -- draws to a close, Canada is particularly proud of all that UNTMIH has accomplished.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Here I wish to pay tribute to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Enrique ter Horst, for the part he played in the success of UNTMIH. His outstanding diplomatic skills were crucial assets and were highly appreciated by the Canadian staff of UNTMIH as well as by our embassy in Port-au-Prince.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">We believe that this Mission enabled a smooth and successful transition period. UNTMIH paved the way for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to Haiti's long-term development, meshing security concerns with technical assistance and a whole range of environmental, agricultural, educational and administrative reform programmes. Canada's largest bilateral assistance programme in the hemisphere, and one of our largest aid programmes in the world, is found in Haiti. This programme covers a broad range of poverty-reduction and peace-building programmes. We strongly support this measured and careful approach by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">We believe that the new Mission to be established today and the draft resolution which authorizes it are evidence of the continuing commitment of the international community to assisting Haiti as it continues taking these early, important steps along the road to stability and development as a democratic nation. Although the military component of the peacekeeping operation in Haiti will now come to an end, our interest in and support for Haiti's progress are in no way diminished.</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline-spokein" id="pg004-bk03">
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01"><i>spoke in English</i></p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa01">For our part, and on the assumption that there will be wide participation in the new Mission, Canada plans to contribute some 24 of our police officers to MIPONUH, along with six armoured personnel carriers for the special police unit. This will be in addition to the 22 Canadian police experts in Haiti under our bilateral technical assistance programme.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa02">Haiti's immediate security needs cannot be divorced from longer-term development objectives. In this regard, we welcome the flexibility demonstrated by the Council in responding to Haiti's particular circumstances and needs, and especially in providing for MIPONUH's important coordination function with respect to all United Nations activities in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa03">We are particularly pleased that the new Mission will be of one year's duration. The continuity of such a mandate will be of great benefit to Haiti. The Haitian National Police has taken substantial strides forward in providing for Haiti's security needs. However, we agree with both President Préval and the Secretary-General's assessment that there is still much that remains to be done. In the absence of any tradition of civilian policing in Haiti, the guidance, training and mentoring provided by the United Nations Civilian Police, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) technical advisers and by the International Civilian Mission to Haiti (MICIVIH) continue to be critical to fostering good policing practices, which by definition include respect for fundamental human rights. This requires the development of both investigatory and enforcement expertise. It also requires continuing vigilance against the abuse of authority by Haitian National Police officers and, in this regard, we are pleased that these officers are increasingly held accountable for unethical or abusive conduct. We must also encourage the Haitian National Police to develop appropriate supervisory skills, particularly at the middle- and senior-management levels.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa04">Promoting the concept of community policing, so that citizens and police alike do not fall back into old patterns of behaviour that are unsuitable to a civilian force respectful of people's rights and at the service of the community, should be the informing principle of this new Mission. Community policing plays an integral role in other aspects of development, in particular initiatives targeting youth, education and fighting the traffic and consumption of illegal drugs. We look forward to continuing progress in all of these areas.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa05">As we have said before the Council in the past, Canada remains very concerned at the growing gap between the Haitian National Police's achievements and the agonizingly slow pace of judicial reform. We cannot overemphasize the importance of progress in both of these areas. Without judicial reform, the National Police's development will be at best a pyrrhic victory. In partnership with the donor community, the United Nations Secretariat and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), we are continuing to offer the Haitian Government support in this field. Ultimately, however, it is the Government's responsibility to achieve the goal of an effective and fairly administered judicial system.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa06">Finally, the political paralysis which has gripped Haiti for many months is also a source of concern. We urge all political parties in Haiti to work together to find a solution to the impasse and to permit the vital business of government, at this delicate phase in Haiti's development, to proceed. International assistance will be stymied if the host Government is not in a position to plan for and to implement such development.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa07">Yet another milestone in Haiti's history will be passed with the adoption of this draft resolution. We are confident that the new Mission will afford the Government of Haiti a further opportunity to work towards ensuring political stability, respect for fundamental freedoms and economic development for the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa08">For its part, Canada will continue to support strongly the Haitian people in their efforts to meet the challenges of the coming months.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">I shall first give the floor to those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Larraín</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">Despite the unquestionable progress made by the Haitian National Police in recent months, the fact that certain goals have not yet been achieved makes it inadvisable for the United Nations to bring to an end the successful work of supporting and contributing to the professionalization of the Haitian National Police at all levels.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">My delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General for his clear assessment of the situation, contained in his report and its addendum, which are before the Security Council for consideration. The recommendations contained in the report deserve our full support. They are fully in keeping with the ultimate goal of achieving the consolidation of a professional national police force in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">My delegation believes that the existence of such a police force is a basic condition for the rule of law and for the stability of democratic institutions in that country. The United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, have endorsed that approach, and we therefore have before us today a draft resolution that will establish a new United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti to continue to provide assistance to the Government of Haiti, lending support and contributing to the professionalization of its national police force.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The duration of the mandate of the Mission, which is set at a single one-year period, has the merit of being realistic and consistent with the tasks it will have to carry out.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">The draft does not, however, neglect the needs of the Haitian people in the sphere of development. Accordingly, the eighth preambular paragraph stresses the need for a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support economic, social and institutional development in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">The challenges currently faced by the Haitian people are considerable. The increasing professionalization of their police forces has brought out more clearly the constantly growing gap separating those forces from the judicial institutions. In the light of this observation, it seems more necessary than ever for Haitian democratic institutions resolutely to take up the task of judicial reform. No one can take Haiti's place in that endeavour, which must be tackled as soon as possible in parallel with efforts to train the national police.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">As a member of the group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti, Chile is pleased with the results achieved in the text that we will be voting on. We are grateful for the efforts of the delegations of members of the Security Council, which made it possible to accommodate various concerns without sacrificing the requirements of the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">I would not want to conclude without expressing my country's gratitude to all the personnel of the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti, which is finishing up its excellent work, as well as to the countries that contributed to its formation. We are certain that the personnel of the new United Nations Mission will be able to meet the lofty challenge of helping provide Haiti with a truly professional and democratic police force.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Monteiro</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Portugal is a sponsor of the draft resolution before the Council on the constitution of the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH).</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Despite some progress, serious problems persist in Haiti that require the continuation of the assistance of the United Nations. We are concerned about the continuation of violence and unrest, the difficult economic situation, the high level of unemployment, the rising cost of living and the slow pace of change in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">Given the fact that elections are due to take place in November 1998, the period ahead will be of crucial importance for the consolidation of democracy and national reconstruction. For that reason, comprehensive and sustained long-term assistance by the international community is vitally important.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">A continued commitment, in particular from the international financial institutions and other United Nations agencies, is necessary to promote a successful and sustainable development that will underpin political stability in the country. We want to help Haitians build up a country where democracy and progress will be a reality. That can be achieved only if the rule of law and respect for human rights are ensured.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">The Secretary-General's latest report underlines that, despite some progress, the Haitian National Police has not reached the level of professionalization required to tackle successfully the various problems in daily activities. In fact, a self-sustained and fully functioning police force is essential to ensure a secure and stable environment, economic rehabilitation and the consolidation of democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">We therefore believe that it is of the utmost importance to maintain for a period of one year, until 30 November 1998, the presence of the United Nations, as the present draft resolution foresees. As requested recently by President Préval, the new Mission will continue to help the Government of Haiti professionalize its police force. In this context, we urge Haiti's authorities to pursue their efforts to form a public force respectful of legality, and also to pursue their efforts to revitalize Haiti's justice system, to which the Permanent Representative of Haiti referred earlier.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to the positive role played by the personnel of the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) and their Governments, and also to the United States and Canada for their positive roles in ensuring the success of the Mission so far. Finally, I would also like to express a special word of commendation for the role played by the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Haiti.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Berrocal Soto</span> <span class="nation">Costa Rica</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">The delegation of Costa Rica takes special satisfaction from the Security Council's holding of this formal meeting to discuss the situation in Haiti and to adopt the draft resolution that will establish the new United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">Some years ago, when forces hostile to freedom and democracy flouted the will of the Haitian people and destroyed the constitutional order in that country, the United Nations responded with immediacy and solidarity, unanimously condemning such illegitimate actions. When its support was needed, the Council gave timely approval to the establishment of a peacekeeping mission to support pluralistic democracy and the Government that had been freely chosen by the Haitian people at the polls.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">Due to the particular nature of political developments in Haiti, the armed forces of that Caribbean country have played a negative, repressive and disingenuous role with respect to the aspirations of the people. For that reason, Costa Rica has been of the view that an essential prerequisite for the consolidation of peace and national reconciliation in Haiti is demilitarization, the elimination of the armed forces and the creation of an apolitical and professional civilian police force.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">The establishment of democratic peace in Haiti is also inextricably linked to the rule of law and, especially, the existence and functioning of a strong, independent and efficient judiciary with the necessary capacity to combat impunity and respond to the challenge of guaranteeing and promoting respect for the human rights of the population. This is one of the main factors for guaranteeing the political and institutional capacity of the Haitian State to give a prompt, timely, independent and full response to its inhabitants' longing for justice. That has been the focus of particular international attention, and we trust that the material support that this Organization has been giving to the process of strengthening the administration of justice in Haiti can be maintained.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">One other essential aspect to consider is the fact that the existence and durability of peace in Haiti are based on the need to promote a true process of sustainable development and equity. This is frequently a commonplace in diplomatic and political discourse, but in the case of Haiti, it is an imperative and urgent matter that requires our attention.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">We cannot ignore the worrying international figures contained in international statistics. Haiti has the highest poverty index in the western hemisphere, and on the basis of more general factors, it ranks last among the countries of the region in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) <i>Human Development Index</i>. We will not be able to say that peace in Haiti has been consolidated and firmly established so long as its inhabitants do not enjoy fair conditions of economic development and social justice. In this regard, Costa Rica views with special concern the fact that in the last year the international community has reduced its economic assistance to Haiti. We wish to appeal clearly for this trend to be reversed, and we trust that initiatives such as the UNDP "Haiti 2012" initiative will enjoy sufficient material support from cooperating countries.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">The draft resolution before us, which my delegation is honoured to co-sponsor, is a timely response by the Security Council to the present situation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">The operations of the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti in the process of the professionalization of the Haitian National Police demonstrated the need and justification for international support in this area. Therefore, we are sure that in the future the security and stability provided by the Haitian National Police will ensure conditions in which the process of judicial reform can continue and will mark out an appropriate setting for the process of economic revitalization.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">Nonetheless, this entire effort will be pointless if the Haitian political class does not show a true sense of responsibility and determination to assume its obligations in the area of national reconciliation. Costa Rica, having brotherly relations with Haiti, appeals to the political leaders of that country to put aside confrontation and division and to work in unity and solidarity for peace, democracy, progress and equity for all Haitians.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">In this context, my delegation fully supports the Secretary-General's initiative to establish the new United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti on an exceptional basis. As expressed in the report, the Mission will be entrusted with helping the Government of Haiti in the professionalization of the national Police in that fraternal country.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Elaraby</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">The Security Council is meeting today to examine a draft resolution submitted regarding the establishment of the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) which will replace the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) after it has successfully fulfilled its Security Council mandate. In this regard, the delegation of Egypt would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General and to his Special Representative, Mr. Enrique ter Horst.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">My delegation has reviewed the report of the Secretary-General [<a href="../pdf/S-1997-832.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/832</a> and Add.1], which clearly reflects the great achievements of the Mission and the technical assistance it has provided to the Haitian National Police, especially in the areas of rapid intervention, investigation and the professionalization of the work of the Haitian National Police in the operational sphere. The draft resolution before the Council today comes in response to the appeal addressed by President Préval of Haiti to the Secretary-General for continued United Nations assistance to the Haitian National Police after the end of the mandate of the Transition Mission. That appeal also coincided with the sensitive situation perceived by the United Nations in Haiti. All that prompted the Secretary-General to send a Special Representative to assess the prevailing situation in Haiti, which led to the recommendation by the Secretary-General to set up a Civilian Police Mission in Haiti in order to help supplement the support and training of the Haitian National Police.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">In view of Egypt's perception of the important and vital role of the United Nations and the significance of its operational activities in bringing stability and providing support for national institutions that operate in the developing countries in the sphere of national reconciliation, we stress here the relevance of supporting the efforts of President Preval to overcome the political crisis facing Haiti, and that attainment of final resolutions of the main areas of dispute among the political actors, namely, elections, economic reform and the appointment of a new Prime Minister. However, Haiti's political problems, as emphasized in the report of the Secretary-General and the provisions of the draft resolution on which we are about to vote today, underscore once again the need to address the economic problems facing Haiti. Therefore, the efforts of the United Nations Development Programme, as well as those of other United Nations agencies and programmes, will be crucial in achieving real economic growth rates which would eventually lead to political stability in Haiti. All of this will hinge upon the financial and technical assistance rendered by the international community to the process of development. Therefore, the delegation of Egypt appeals to the international community to respond to the call made by the Secretary-General to expedite the provision of voluntary contributions for the economic reconstruction of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">Finally, we recognize that the reference made in the draft resolution to special arrangements accorded to the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) will not constitute a precedent for other operations of the same nature which the United Nations may deal with in the future. In accordance with our understanding, such arrangements arise from the particular nature of the current situation in Haiti at this time, and the requirements of dealing with it. Accordingly, Egypt will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dejammet</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">The support of the United Nations has played an essential role in the establishment in Haiti of a police force that respects legality. The strengthening of the national police is essential for the consolidation of democracy and a State based on the rule of law in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Following earlier United Nations missions, the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH), whose mandate ends on 30 November, has supported efforts made by the Haitian authorities, particularly in the area of police training. United Nations monitors have also provided assistance to the Haitian National Police in carrying out their daily tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">As stressed by President Préval in his letter of 29 October addressed to the Secretary-General, this police force, which has been in action for only two years, still needs support to complete its development.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The Secretary-General's report notes that the current situation in the country remains fraught with uncertainty. There are still many difficulties -- political, social and security difficulties. It is therefore essential that the security of the population be guaranteed by a police force which is competent, effective, and which enjoys the trust of the people.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">For all these reasons, France supports the request of the Haitian authorities to establish a civilian police mission. It also supports the recommendations made by the Secretary-General to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">Within the group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti, France participated in the preparation of the draft resolution now before the Council. France will vote in favour of the text. The draft resolution proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police mission for the next 12 months. This mission will be responsible for helping the authorities to continue with the work of professionalizing the Haitian National Police.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">While continuing the work already undertaken by the United Nations, the new mission will mark a change compared to previous missions. This mission will be entirely composed of civilian police. Specific arrangements have been made, <i>inter alia, </i>in the area of the security of United Nations monitors. However, these arrangements, as the draft resolution makes clear, do not constitute precedents for other operations of the same kind.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">France will continue to contribute financially to the mission under the terms of United Nations resolutions on this subject. In this regard, we took note with interest of the document submitted to us during unofficial consultations this morning that gives the picture of contributions made, payments outstanding and amounts due. It is agreeable for France to see that it is fully paid up with regard to past contributions for the financing of United Nations missions. We hope that this example, which fortunately is not the only example, will be followed by all Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">We will also give a contribution in staff comparable to the one we gave to the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti. France will make available to the new mission 36 gendarmes and policemen, as well as the senior officer who is currently heading the police force.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Owada</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">With the assistance and support provided by the United Nations civilian police element, including the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH), certain improvements have been made in the professionalization of the Haitian National Police. I wish to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Government of Japan for the contributions which this international effort has made to the rehabilitation process in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Despite these improvements, Japan recognizes that the international community must continue to support the training and professionalization of the Haitian National Police to ensure that it is capable of maintaining law and order throughout society and to nurture the democratization process. Japan thus supports the establishment of a United Nations police mission in Haiti, or MIPONUH, as referred to in the addendum to the Secretary-General's report. We owe a special debt of gratitude to those countries that have contributed to UNTMIH for their willingness to make their personnel, equipment and other supplies available to this new follow-on force.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The role of a civilian police force can be truly effective only if there is a credible judicial system in place. In this context, the delay in the establishment of such a judicial system in Haiti is a matter of acute concern. Japan calls upon the Government of Haiti to work in good faith to revitalize the system of justice as expeditiously as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Other grave problems remain. In particular, my delegation cannot but express its grave concern about the fact that the country has been without a functioning Government since the Prime Minister resigned in June. For the democratization process to proceed, it is essential that the political parties put aside their differences and agree to engage in cooperation for an effective Government without further delay.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Recognizing that the stability of Haiti is important to the stability of the Caribbean region and, indeed, to the Latin American region as a whole, Japan contributed $3 million dollars in March 1995 to the United Nations trust fund for the establishment of the Haitian police. This is in addition to the cooperation it has extended to Haiti in the three years since the democratic Government was established. It has been providing this cooperation, amounting to more than $50 million dollars, in such forms as assistance for economic structural reform, food aid, assistance for food production and planning and technical assistance for road construction. In extending this assistance, it has been Japan's intention to assist in the process of economic development and democratization to be promoted by the Government and people of Haiti. This is an endeavor that must remain a matter of great interest to all of us in the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">For all these reasons, Japan will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahugu</span> <span class="nation">Kenya</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">When the Kenya delegation supported the transformation of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) into the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) on 30 July 1997, we stressed that the vote was a strong gesture in support of the Haitian people. Today, this support is still undiminished and strong, and Kenya will once again register its support for the Haitian people by joining in the establishment of a United Nations police mission in Haiti to be known as MIPONUH.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">The evolution of Haiti's political transition process requires that the Haitian National Police receives all the assistance it can get, in order to completely professionalize its structures and operations. This monumental task is made even more urgent by a worrisome proliferation of weapons and the lack of an adequate police presence in some remote areas of the country, thus resulting in the formation of vigilante groups. It is, therefore, quite commendable that, despite these difficulties, the Haitian National Police has made some noteworthy organizational and operational progress in at least three of the nine departments, as well as instilling discipline in the force.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Much progress has been made, but clearly more needs to be done. A transition process troubled by incessant insecurity hinders a solid post-conflict peace-building effort. Indeed, as the Secretary-General states in paragraph 39 of his 31 October 1997 report:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg009-bk02-pa04">"the National Police will need international assistance if it is to continue to pursue its own institutional development while meeting the country's increasing security needs".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">President Réné Préval's letter to the Secretary-General dated 29 October 1997 noted the importance of strengthening the Haitian National Police force. Haiti can count on Kenya's support of this request for a suitable follow-on civilian police mission. This would definitely enhance the training of the police to ensure that:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg009-bk02-pa06">"this institution, indispensable to the establishment of a State truly under the rule of law, can develop in a balanced way, smoothly and quickly".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">We are indeed hopeful that its establishment next week on 1 December 1997 will achieve this result.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">In our last statement on this matter my delegation stressed that only a concerted, wholehearted attack on poverty and a complete focus on development would alleviate Haiti's problems. As a developing country, we know that at the heart of the insecurity problem inside Haiti lies the unyielding weight of poverty and relative lack of improvement in the basic living conditions of the Haitian people. We are therefore happy to note the continued efforts by the international community, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to formulate a long-term development initiative known as "Haiti 2012".</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">A consensus by interested parties on the development path the country should take will, hopefully, alleviate the donor fatigue referred to in the Secretary-General's report and enable Haiti to compete more effectively for what is referred to as a diminishing pool of official resources. My delegation is therefore hopeful that in the months prior to the termination of the mandate of the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) on 30 November 1998 the international community will focus more on the development side of its relations with Haiti and gradually disengage its security/military/civilian police links with Haiti. We say this fully aware that development is achievable only within a peaceful socio-political environment, a position that in the past has driven and continues to energize Kenya's own regional peacemaking efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Haiti's future lies in the evolution of credible, strong institutions. Institutionalizing regular elections within its democratic process is a major step in the right direction. Inter-party negotiations to create a Permanent Electoral Council in a spirit of tolerance and reconciliation, as recently reiterated by the Secretary-General, will greatly facilitate the transition and adequately prepare the Haitian people for legislative and local elections by November 1998. It is also because of the necessity of establishing credible institutions that my delegation wholeheartedly welcomes the Secretary-General's appeal that judicial reform be a priority, firmly entrenched in the knowledge that the rule of law is a fundamental building block of any democratic system.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">All the above-mentioned issues are addressed specifically or generally in the draft resolution. We also note the proposal in the draft that MIPONUH be a one-year operation, without extension. We support this approach, and my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa12">Cognizant of the fact that the ultimate responsibility for Haiti lies in Haitian hands, my delegation warmly commends the men and women of UNTMIH for a job well done, and encourages the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti to continue the good work as they try to resolve Haiti's problems, with the help of Mr. Enrique ter Horst, the Secretary-General's hard-working Special Representative.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Matuszewski</span> <span class="nation">Poland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Despite the considerable progress that has been made since the return of democratic rule to Haiti, the situation in that country continues to be difficult and highly precarious. The apparent inability of the Haitian State institutions to overcome the continuing constitutional crisis causes us concern. We join other members of the Council in appealing to the political forces in Haiti to resume meaningful dialogue with a view to improving the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">While it must be emphasized that the ultimate responsibility for the future of their country rests with the Haitians themselves, the need for the international community to assist them in securing further progress towards peace, democracy and prosperity is evident. The Secretary-General in his report has identified the areas where this assistance is particularly important and outlined its operational framework. The law enforcement system and the judiciary figure prominently on the Secretary-General's list, and rightly so.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">As stated by the Secretary-General, the most recent examination of the development of the Haitian National Police has brought mixed results. With progress revealed in some key areas, shortcomings -- at times significant -- continue to abound. Consequently, to consolidate the achievements recorded so far, the establishment of a follow-on Mission aimed at helping the Haitian National Police to reach the standards required of a fully professional police force is warranted. The draft resolution appropriately addresses the situation by setting up a United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) with a one-year mandate to continue to assist the Government of Haiti by supporting and contributing to the professionalization of the Haitian National Police.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">While considering the new United Nations Mission in Haiti, the Security Council took note of the letter dated 29 October 1997 from the President of Haiti, Mr. René Préval, and the request it contained for further assistance in the training of the Haitian police. It is important to note that the President of Haiti emphasizes in his letter that there is no further need to contemplate the presence of United Nations military forces in his country. This in itself speaks volumes about the difference the predecessors of MIPONUH made in the life of Haiti. Mr. Préval's letter is also welcome as a declaration that the Haitian authorities are ready to assume full responsibility for maintaining security in their country.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">The delegation of Poland wishes to thank the sponsors for the draft resolution they have submitted to the Council. For the reasons I have just stated, the delegation of Poland will vote in favour of it.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the members of the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) and its predecessors, the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) and the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), for their contribution to peace, security and stability in Haiti and in the whole region. I would also like to express gratitude to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Haiti, Mr. Enrique ter Horst, for the leadership he has provided in achieving the unquestionable success of the United Nations endeavours in Haiti. We believe that the Governments of the United States and Canada, whose generous contributions made it possible to give the United Nations peacekeeping operations in Haiti the necessary strength, deserve our sincere appreciation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Park</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Successive United Nations Missions, from the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) to the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH), have laid solid foundations for peace and stability in Haiti. They have achieved important progress, in particular, in professionalising the Haitian National Police, which is vital to the rule of law and the successful transition to a stable democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">And yet, in the light of the precarious security situation and the lack of a functioning judicial system, compounded by the climate of political instability, more should be done if the international community's hard-won achievements are to be made irreversible. The consolidation of the rule of law is the very basis for promoting human rights and democracy. This is possible only when Haiti has an effective, politically neutral and professional law enforcement mechanism. In this regard, the professionalization of the Haitian National Police is the most cost-effective way for the international community to make a difference in the destiny of Haiti by helping to consolidate the rule of law in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">We wish to emphasize here again that international assistance cannot be a substitute for fulfilment of the ultimate responsibility of the Haitian people and their political leaders to resolve their own problems. In this connection, it is our strong hope that the political forces in Haiti will work together to put an end to the ongoing political paralysis.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">In the longer term, peace and stability in Haiti will be viable only when firmly backed by a functioning democracy and socio-economic development. For this reason, we look forward to the successful holding of a general election in November next year and attach great importance to the sustained support of international financial institutions and the specialized agencies of the United Nations in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The Republic of Korea reiterates its strong commitment to peace and stability, based on the rule of law and vibrant democracy, in Haiti. We have provided assistance to Haiti in the modest amount of more than $500,000 since 1995, including a voluntary contribution of $200,000 to the Trust Fund established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-975(1995).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 975 (1995)</a> and the provision of police equipment on a bilateral basis.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Korea takes note of the request of President Préval, and supports the establishment of a United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti. We therefore will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">Finally, we highly commend Mr. ter Horst for his eminent leadership and the men and women who have served in the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) for the successful completion of their mission.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">The United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) has successfully followed up on the efforts of its predecessors in making significant contributions in an area of fundamental importance to Haiti's political, economic and social development. The United Nations system has been instrumental in improving the conduct and effectiveness of the Haitian National Police. We are pleased to note that emphasis can now be put on the civilian element of the international presence in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">The setting up of a new mission, the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH), once more demonstrates the increasing importance of civilian police in the development of democratic institutions following strife or conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">The case of Haiti still requires some exceptional solutions, due to the fragile security situation. We are satisfied that the arrangements envisaged in MIPONUH are tailor-made for Haiti, and will not necessarily serve as precedents for other civilian police operations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">In establishing a new civilian police mission in Haiti today, the Council has acted on a request by President Préval. The success of this operation depends on the complete cooperation and support of the Haitian authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Reform of the National Police is far from the only essential requirement for consolidating democracy and the rule of law in Haiti. The absence of a functioning and reliable judicial system remains an immediate concern. The Haitian leaders must do their utmost to re-establish faith in their capacity to resolve the problems facing their country and to earn the respect of the people.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">The international community remains committed to a long-term programme for the development of Haiti in support of national efforts. This programme should include economic, social and institutional development. We foresee a need for increased involvement by international financial institutions and United Nations special agencies in this process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Sweden, for its part, is presently considering a contribution to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Trust Fund for Haiti.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">The Russian delegation is pleased to note that the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH), which played a significant role in strengthening the bases of constitutional democracy, has successfully fulfilled the tasks entrusted to it by the Security Council under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1123(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1123 (1997)</a>. The United Nations military operation has been completed. A stable, albeit fragile, situation is being maintained in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">The Haitian National Police continue to gain experience. Events in that country, as we have repeatedly pointed out, did not and still do not pose a threat to regional peace and security. The situation in Haiti is marked by a complex transition to democracy, which unfortunately does not have firm roots in Haitian society, and has been exacerbated by a prolonged social and economic crisis. In this context, resolving the problem of Haiti's economic rehabilitation and reconstruction takes on particular importance. We are convinced that only by successfully carrying out that task can we create a truly firm basis for the strengthening of democracy in that country. The international community will in future have to supply technological, economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development, democratic institution-building and respect for human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">We are not against maintaining a United Nations presence in Haiti, but with the proviso that it is conducted in keeping with today's real requirements. In our view, the peacekeeping role of the United Nations in Haiti has been successfully fulfilled. At the same time, we have taken into consideration the request of President René Préval and the recommendation of the Secretary-General, as well as the views of the group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti. We have accommodated their wishes and are prepared to support the proposal to establish a new United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) in order to continue international assistance to strengthen the Haitian National Police, but with the clear understanding that the new operation will, as the draft resolution provides, have a clearly defined mandate limited to a single one-year period ending on 30 November 1998. In our view, future assistance to the Haitian National Police should be provided through the United Nations special agencies and programmes, <i>inter alia</i>, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), international and regional organizations and bilateral channels by interested countries.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">We also deem it appropriate to note that in the context of the Haitian operation we cannot forget the acute financial crisis the United Nations is experiencing, the reasons for which are well known to all, namely, the problem of non-payment by a number of States Members. Even this comparatively small new Mission in Haiti is still very burdensome for the lean United Nations peacekeeping budget. In this connection, I would emphasize that the Russian Federation has no debts with regard to the Mission in Haiti, and we hope that other States will discharge their obligations. We welcome the additional voluntary contributions by interested States to ease the financial implications for the United Nations of carrying out this new operation. We are grateful to the sponsors of the draft resolution for having taken our proposals into account in the draft.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">In view of that and the points I made earlier, and in a spirit of compromise, our delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Burleigh</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Over the last three years the Government and people of Haiti have made progress in building an inclusive and representative democracy. Institutions such as the Haitian Parliament and municipal governments have developed into independent bodies. Political violence no longer threatens Haitians in their daily lives, and today Haiti enjoys a free press. Fundamental economic reforms are beginning, including the first privatization of a State-owned industry. In short, the foundation for broad-based growth is being laid.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">The United Nations -- through the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH), the United Nations Development Programme and the International Civilian Mission in Haiti -- is playing an essential role in this process. As a sign of the progress to date, the remaining United Nations military element can be withdrawn.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Today, the Haitian National Police includes over 6,000 officers who are present in all nine of Haiti's provinces. At the request of President René Préval and at the recommendation of the Secretary-General, we act today to ensure its further development. The continued growth of the Haitian National Police from a few young and inexperienced recruits to an effective, independent police force is crucial to Haiti's future. The creation of the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) to assist in mentoring and training the Haitian National Police will build upon a process already well begun. My Government commends all those who have contributed to MIPONUH's predecessor, UNTMIH, particularly the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Enrique ter Horst. The many nations that have participated in UNTMIH's work can take pride in their accomplishment. My Government remains committed to supporting peaceful political and economic development in Haiti. To this end, we are providing helicopters, a medical unit and up to 50 civilian police for MIPONUH, in addition to nearly $100 million in bilateral economic assistance this year. We will also consider other ways to support MIPONUH.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">The Government of Haiti is fast approaching full responsibility for public safety. But despite the progress, obstacles remain. The Haitian National Police still needs help in dealing with ruthless gangs, drug traffickers and political groups that seek to manipulate the police for their own ends. The presence of a civilian police mission will allow Haiti's police to continue its growth in competence for another year.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">As the Secretary-General's report makes clear, we must not close our eyes to the problems that persist. The efforts of the international community come against a backdrop of deep division within Haiti over the course and the pace of political and economic change. There, as elsewhere, democracy remains a work in progress. If the Haitian people are to see a brighter future, they must receive the necessary tools and assistance from the international community. Creation of MIPONUH will do just that, and for that reason the United States strongly supports its establishment.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of China.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">China has always been concerned about the situation in Haiti. We sincerely hope that the political situation in Haiti will stabilize and economic reconstruction start as soon as possible. It is out of this desire that China has consistently supported the peacekeeping operation of the United Nations in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">We believe that the United Nations should promptly conclude its peacekeeping operation in Haiti, transfer the focus of its work to helping Haiti undertake economic reconstruction and provide the necessary assistance in this regard. In this respect, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank and other multilateral-assistance institutions can play a leading role.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">Considering the current situation in Haiti and the request from the Haitian Government, China agrees to keep the United Nations civilian police operation in Haiti, as an exceptional case. We hope that this will allow the Haitian National Police to be professionalized promptly and enable Haiti to embark on the road towards stability and development.</p>
