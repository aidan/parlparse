<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Sorreta" nation="Philippines" language="">
	Mr. Sorreta (Philippines)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa01">It gives me great pleasure to introduce to the General Assembly the reports of the First Committee on agenda items 64 to 85. These reports are contained in documents <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-551.pdf">A/54/551</a> to <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-572.pdf">A/54/572</a>. These reports contain an account of the action we have taken on the draft resolutions and draft decisions under these agenda items, as well as copies of these draft resolutions and draft decisions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa02">There are minor corrections to be made to four of these reports, so far, which I will read out shortly. The four reports that will require some corrections are <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-552.pdf">A/54/552</a>, <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-564.pdf">A/54/564</a>, <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-565.pdf">A/54/565</a> and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-571.pdf">A/54/571</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa03">To guide us in the actions we are about to take today, the Secretariat has prepared document A/C.1/54/INF/3, a table listing the draft resolutions and draft decisions by agenda item number, with spaces within which the action or votes to be taken today can be listed by delegations. I hope we all have copies of the reports, as well as of the document containing this table.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa04">The First Committee concluded its work at the current session in five weeks with 28 formal meetings. In those 28 formal meetings the Committee dealt with a wide range of disarmament and international security issues, including the question of Antarctica.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa05">With 49 draft resolutions, 4 draft decisions and 1 amendment to a draft resolution for consideration, more than any other Main Committee, we had quite a challenge before us. Subsequently, 1 draft resolution was withdrawn and 48 draft resolutions and 4 decisions were adopted. Of the draft resolutions and decisions adopted, 30, or about 58 per cent, were adopted without a vote. Perhaps it is also worth mentioning that the work of the First Committee at this session was marked by an absence of procedural motions or actions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa06">As in previous sessions, nuclear issues continued to outnumber all other issues before the First Committee. Seventeen draft resolutions and decisions, or about 30 per cent of the total, focused on nuclear weapons, including those that covered nuclear-weapon-free zones, nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and its entry into force, and prohibition of the production of fissile material for weapons purposes. Not surprisingly, a new draft resolution relating to nuclear weapons attracted much attention. The draft resolution entitled "Preservation of and compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty", at least according to the keepers of institutional knowledge in the Secretariat, was adopted with a rather peculiar pattern of voting. This draft resolution was also the only draft amended in the First Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa07">A draft resolution entitled "Missiles" also made its first appearance in the First Committee, attracting the interest and curiosity of many delegations. This draft resolution was placed under the cluster on nuclear issues, in the belief that the greatest danger from missiles is presented by those of a nuclear nature. On other weapons of mass destruction, the consensus was far clearer. The Committee adopted all four draft resolutions on other weapons of mass destruction without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa08">The issue of conventional weapons also attracted wide attention in the Committee. The draft resolution on banning landmines, which enjoyed overwhelming support, proposes the convening of the Second Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction in September 2000 in Geneva.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa09">In addition to landmines, much attention was also focused on the issue of small arms and light weapons. There were three draft resolutions relating to this. One draft resolution proposed the holding of the international conference on the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons in all its aspects in the year 2001. In this draft resolution, the First Committee recommended the establishment of a preparatory committee to work on the draft objective, agenda, rules of procedure, final documents and date and venue of the conference and its subsequent sessions. The establishment of this committee will no doubt facilitate the preparatory work and will ensure the success of the conference. I understand there are further developments relating to this draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa10">In the area of disarmament forums, an impasse remained on the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa11">Also on the issue of disarmament machinery, I would like to draw the attention of delegations to the draft resolution on the report of the Disarmament Commission. Since no agreement was reached during the session of the First Committee, the substantive items on the agenda of the Disarmament Commission at its 2000 substantive session are yet to be decided at the organizational session of the Commission. Consultations have been moving forward, and we are confident that we will soon agree on the substantive items on the agenda of the Disarmament Commission. Again, I understand there will be further developments on this issue today.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa12">As I mentioned earlier, there are a few corrections that have to be made to four reports. Let me now briefly turn to the reports of the First Committee and draw the attention of delegations to a few technical errors which crept into the texts of the following documents. In document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-552.pdf">A/54/552</a>, entitled "Prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons", I would like to draw the Assembly's attention to page 2, paragraph 5. In the third line, after the two words "by Armenia" we should add the following three words: "Egypt and Indonesia". The next report that requires correction is in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-564.pdf">A/54/564</a>, entitled "Review and implementation of the Concluding Document of the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly". On page 2, paragraph 5, on the first line, the four words "At the 13th meeting" should be deleted; and on the same line the word "introduced" should be replaced with the word "submitted". In the same document, on page 4, the subtitle "III. Recommendations of the First Committee", please note that it should be moved from after paragraph 15 and placed after paragraph 17.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa13">The third report that requires some minor corrections is in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-565.pdf">A/54/565</a>, entitled "Review of the implementation of the recommendations and decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth special session". On page 3, in paragraph 9, on the first line, the word "submitted" should be replaced with the word "introduced". The fourth and last document, I hope, that will require correction is <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-571.pdf">A/54/571</a>, entitled "Review of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security". On page 3, paragraph 9, the reference which reads (see para. 10) should read (see para. 11).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa14">I would like to ask delegations to please make note of these corrections. I would also like to add that while the Secretariat did an excellent job of assisting me with these reports, all the mistakes and errors in these reports are entirely mine.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa15">Before concluding, I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to all delegations which participated actively and constructively in the work of the First Committee. I should also like to express my special gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee, Ambassador Raimundo Gonzalez of Chile, in guiding the Committee to its successful conclusion. Our Chairman's intimate knowledge of disarmament and international security, his diplomatic skills, his sense of discipline and his good humour ensured that our work would be a fruitful, meaningful and interesting exercise. I, for one, will always think of our Chairman whenever I hear the ringing of a cellular phone.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa16">I would also like to thank the Committee's Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador Günther Seibert of Germany, Mr. Kestutis Sadauskas of Lithuania and Mr. Tarig Ali Bakhit of the Sudan, for their support and camaraderie.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa17">I should also like to express my appreciation to Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, for the many things he did for us, particularly for his insights and for helping guide our work from the beginning. I would like to thank Mr. Jin Yongjian, Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, for his valuable contribution and the leadership he provided to the Secretariat staff in assisting us in our work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa18">I should also express my gratitude to the staff of the Secretariat for their valuable assistance, professionalism, hard work and dedication. Our Chairman expressed it best in his final remarks when he said that our work would not have proceeded so efficiently if not for the young men and women sitting behind him and sitting and moving around the room. I would also like to thank the interpreters, translators and technical personnel who laboured skilfully and adeptly behind glass panels and in the back rooms.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa19">My special thanks go to Mr. Lin Kuo-chung, Secretary of the First Committee, whose vast experience and high degree of competence contributed significantly to the successful outcome of the Committee's work. I have always enjoyed working with Mr. Lin, and my only regret is that he will be leaving us after the next session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa20">A review of these draft resolutions will show that we will be having a rather busy disarmament schedule next year -- the year of our Millennium Summit. I know that we will all play an active part in next year's work and that our world will be the better for it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa21">With these remarks, I present the reports of the First Committee, as contained in documents <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-551.pdf">A/54/551</a> to <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-572.pdf">A/54/572</a>, to the General Assembly for consideration.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg025-bk04-pa01">Under the sub-item entitled "Regional confidence-building measures", the General Assembly adopts a resolution every year on the activities of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa. This year we have draft resolution A, adopted without a vote on 5 November by the First Committee, which is found in paragraph 18 of document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-564.pdf">A/54/564</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg025-bk04-pa02">The First Committee adopted the text without a vote when the members of the Standing Advisory Committee had just concluded their final meeting for 1998-1999. This dealt with the subregional conference on the proliferation of and illicit traffic in light weapons and small arms in Central Africa and the ministerial meeting of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa, held from 25 to 27 October and 27 to 30 October 1999, respectively, at N'Djamena. It goes without saying that important decisions were adopted at those meetings, and we would like, with the support of all delegations, to include them in draft resolution A. This is the thrust of the request made by the sponsors of the amendments in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.39.pdf">A/54/L.39</a>, submitted by the following countries: Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe and Chad, as Chairman of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg025-bk04-pa03">As one can see from reading document L.39, the amendments proposed for after operative paragraph 4 (d) specify more clearly the gatherings organized in Cameroon and in Chad during the period 1998-1999 within the activities of the Standing Advisory Committee and of the two committees. The important number of those meetings shows, as if it were needed, the interest the countries attach to the activities of those two committees. The wording proposed for the end of operative paragraph 6 is, I think, important because of the support requested of the Secretary-General for the realization of the mechanism for the promotion, maintenance and consolidation of peace and security so sorely needed in this Central African subregion. For the member States of the Committee, this is a priority which the international community should support.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg025-bk04-pa04">As for the amendments proposed in operative paragraphs 7 and 8, they are designed to strengthen the ability of the Committee to continue its activities. The two paragraphs added after operative paragraph 10 in draft resolution A concern the support which the countries of the subregion will need to solve problems of refugees on the one hand and problems pertaining to peace and security and stability for development in Central Africa on the other.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg025-bk04-pa05">Essentially, these amendments reflect the latest activities of the Standing Committee, as well as some of the concerns expressed by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs during their meetings. They also help to achieve the objectives laid down in <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-46-37.pdf">General Assembly resolution 46/37</a> B on reducing the considerable quantities of existing armaments in the subregion, especially illicit traffic in arms, because of the threat they present to peace, stability and development in our countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg025-bk04-pa06">Support for the amendments in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.39.pdf">A/54/L.39</a> would be support for the countries of the subregion for achieving the objectives of the Committee in promoting peace, stability and development in that part of Africa. The sponsors then hope that this draft resolution, thus amended, will be adopted by consensus.</div>
