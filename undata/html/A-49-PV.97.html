<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">It is my sad duty to recall to the General Assembly the death, a month ago today, of Mr. James P. Grant, former Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">Mr. Grant was the third Executive Director of UNICEF. He held this position from 1 January 1980 until 23 January 1995, when he resigned because of ill health. Mr. Grant was one of the most dedicated officials of the United Nations. His commitment to the cause of children around the world was well known and will never be forgotten. His devotion to the cause of children in Africa was reflected, <i>inter alia</i>, in the institution of the Day of the African Child, which has been celebrated annually for the past four years.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">On behalf of the General Assembly, I should like to request the representative of the United States of America to convey to the Government of the United States of America and to the family of Mr. Grant our expressions of profound sympathy.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">May I now ask representatives to stand and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of Mr. James P. Grant.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">I now call on the representative of the United States of America.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gnehm</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">Mr. President, I thank you for your kind remarks, which I shall indeed convey to my Government and to Mr. Grant's family.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">I am honoured and pleased to be able to address the General Assembly at this memorial to Jim Grant and to speak about his contributions to the international community. While we are all saddened by his passing, a review of his life's work should give us renewed strength and purpose. To his very last day, Jim Grant's life was a triumph. He showed us that one dedicated person can make a major, positive difference in the world.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa03">I also take great pride in representing the United States of America at this tribute. Jim Grant's long career in public service, which began in the United States Government and culminated with his appointment as Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), symbolizes the best in the commitment of the United States of America and its citizens to assist those in need throughout the world. Jim Grant's leadership reaffirmed and strengthened UNICEF's support among the American people. He effectively communicated his sense of mission, and his focused concern for the welfare of children throughout the world, to people in this country. The response of Americans was intense and generous. We all have much to learn from him in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa04">The high esteem in which Jim Grant is held in this country was best symbolized by the attendance of our First Lady at the memorial service at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine here in New York. She spoke of his extraordinary dedication, a dedication that continued to his last days, when he made a special appeal to our President to sign the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. As a symbol of our respect for Jim Grant, the First Lady announced at that service our intention to sign the Convention. It was the right thing for the United States, to do, and Jim Grant was instrumental in persuading President Clinton to do it. The signing took place just one week later, here at the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa05">As we prepare to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we should keep in mind the example and vision which Jim Grant has provided to us. That is, a United Nations which is genuinely concerned with and responsive to the problems that affect people, especially the most vulnerable ones. If we continue to foster and promote that type of United Nations, we will have been true to Jim Grant's great legacy.</p>
