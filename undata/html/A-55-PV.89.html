	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk09-pa02">My comments focus on two points. The first point deals with paragraph 4 of part II of the draft resolution and concerns the use of conference resources and facilities. That paragraph indicates that we must include all the resources needed in the budget for the biennium 2002-2003 in order to provide interpretation for regional meetings. It is our hope that this commitment will be fully understood and fulfilled. As for the phrase "in accordance with established practice", we hope that such a specification will not reduce the resources available for regional meetings.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk09-pa03">My second point relates to paragraph 15 of part III. In that paragraph, the General Assembly welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General regarding the backlog in the publication of the <i>Repertoire  </i>of the Security Council and asks him to publish current and future issues of the <i>Repertoire  </i>in all six official languages. Our understanding of this paragraph is that from now on all documents will be published simultaneously in all six languages and that documents should not be published in one language and not the others.

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk05-pa01">I note from the Secretary-General's smile that he is particularly pleased that we are discussing this item on our agenda. We, too, are pleased. We have left the conference room used by the Fifth Committee, which through long nights gradually became a souk, then a dormitory and eventually a torture chamber. Exhausted, but relieved and happy, we have now arrived here.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk05-pa02">If we have been able safely to reach this solemn Hall with a great success to our credit, it is thanks above all to Gert Rosenthal. I wish to pay a solemn tribute to the Chairman of the Fifth Committee. His two coordinators, Ambassador Abelian and our friend Frank Smith, have also earned our thanks, as has the Secretariat as a whole, which, through all these days and nights, has done a truly fantastic job.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk05-pa03">The member countries of the European Union wish to offer their heartfelt gratitude and a fraternal salute to the Ambassador of Nigeria, who led the work of the Group of 77 and China with competence, authority and great talent, for which I highly commend him. We set out from positions that were often very far apart and we managed to find common ground on the two scales that we will shortly be adopting. I wish to include the Ambassador of Colombia in these words of thanks. He turned our studious weekends into times of intellectual pleasure in the conference room, which we feel has now become one of New York's most select clubs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk05-pa04">The Millennium Summit -- the greatest Summit ever assembled -- gave new impetus to our Organization. Today, we can perpetuate that impetus by placing the United Nations on a solid footing. The Brahimi report will be implemented, ensuring better management of peacekeeping operations. Today, we will be taking a decision on both scales, notably that for peacekeeping operations, which has undergone fundamental reform -- the first, in fact, in 27 years.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk05-pa05">We have succeeded because we did not know that success was impossible. This great success story is a collective one and the member States of the European Union wish to convey our gratitude to all delegations. On behalf of the European Union, I urge that we now fully implement the decisions taken, in particular section B of the draft resolution contained in document A/C.5/55/L.36 on the regular budget. For us, section B is an essential part of the draft resolution. It establishes the precise terms of an alternative to be fully implemented in accordance with the various terms it establishes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk05-pa06">More than ever before, the European Union is resolved to provide its decisive support to help us attain our common aspiration: the practical, daily implementation of the ideals of the United Nations Charter.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa01">As one of the major contributors to the regular budget of the United Nations, Brazil participated in the negotiations on the scale of assessments in the spirit of flexibility, fully aware of their importance to the future of this Organization. We are facing extraordinary challenges and we all feel that the task has been accomplished.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa02">As is widely and clearly known, Brazil faces at this time a very special situation that derives from distortions in the conversion of our economic data. This kind of situation has been foreseen in previous resolutions on the scale calling for the correction of excessive distortions in the income of States Members. These distortions result in an important artificial increase in the Brazilian assessment rate. We regret that there has not been the necessary political will to fully address this serious imbalance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa03">While we recognize the important efforts made towards its alleviation, the result still leads to Brazil's being assessed substantially above its real participation in the world's output. It is also unfair that a disproportionate increase in the Brazilian quota will serve to compensate a decrease or to alleviate an increase of the contributions of highly developed countries to the United Nations budget. Indeed, these negotiations have disregarded the established principle requiring that the financial burden be shared in ways that take into account the difference between developed and developing countries. Such imbalance will create serious and unforeseen budgetary constraints for Brazil. That is why we are not in a position to fully endorse such an outcome. However, we have always participated constructively in this Organization and upheld its values and rules, among them the principle that diplomatic negotiations with a sense of fairness and balance are the bedrock of a strong United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa04">Bearing in mind the overriding objective that we share of creating the conditions for a much-needed reform of the United Nations, we did not object to the adoption of the resolution without a vote. We hope that this enormous effort to approve the new scales will open a new phase in our permanent endeavour to strengthen the Organization and make its organs more representative and accountable, thereby increasing the legitimacy, authority and effectiveness of their actions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk09-pa05">Finally, I would like to refer to the excellent work of the coordinators, and especially to the great diplomatic qualities of the Chairman of the Fifth Committee, Ambassador Gert Rosenthal. His wisdom and patience were decisive in achieving a successful outcome of our deliberations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa01">It has been a long, hard day. I do not recall the last time I spent more than 26 consecutive hours confined in this building. This was a negotiating process that was exhausting and, to some extent, uncomfortable for all delegations. Although we reached a consensus -- and consensus is always a reason for satisfaction, because it means agreement has emerged among countries that start with different points of view -- it is not a consensus that I would like to celebrate as I might others. For my country, Chile, the result of the exercise will mean a considerable increase in its assessment -- a result that could in itself have been sufficient reason not to join the consensus. Yet we believe, as do most, if not all, Member States, that we need to look beyond the peculiar reasons that sometimes motivate countries to challenge their commitments to an institution and -- in this case -- consider the financial stability and the future of the United Nations, so that it can function in a way that will facilitate agreement and enable the obligations of its Members to be fulfilled.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa02">I join others in expressing the hope that we can now leave behind us this subject that has unsettled relations between States and begin a new era for our Organization, its Members and its main contributors. Perhaps this new era will not be limited to the resolution of financial problems, but will extend to interest in the noble tasks before the Organization, which also require the kind of leadership that has been shown in this case.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the delegations of New Zealand and of my own country in explanation of position following the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-5.pdf">resolution 55/5</a> B, on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa02">Our delegations welcome the adoption of this resolution by consensus. We recognize the difficult circumstances facing many delegations during these negotiations, including the pressures on developing countries, many of which are faced with steep increases between the scale periods. To help ease some of this pain, our delegations, like those of other countries, gave our full support to the phase-in arrangements which are referred to in paragraph 4 of the resolution. I think that colleagues will recognize that the delegations of Australia and New Zealand have always tried to be a voice of reason and practicality. We have also always tried hard, while defending our own national interests, to defend and protect the United Nations and its rules and reform processes. Colleagues will recall successive statements in both formal and informal meetings urging that in our push for agreement we not take bad decisions, not retreat from reforms already agreed and not distort the scale methodology unduly and in ways which could create problems in the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa03">We are pleased with the level of accommodation to competing interests that this scale has been able to achieve without unduly compromising the integrity of the scale methodology. To the extent possible, we have sought to spread the pain equitably, and we believe we have achieved this. We continue to believe, however, that a true reflection of capacity to pay is some way off. We should continue to strive to avoid methodological adjustments made in order to sidestep our basic responsibility as Member States to pay our fair share of United Nations costs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa04">By adopting this resolution, the General Assembly has decided to reduce the ceiling from 25 per cent to 22 per cent, thereby reducing the assessment of the major contributor by 3 per cent. The ceiling is a distortion of the principle of capacity to pay, and this reduction a further distortion of this important principle. Our opposition to the reduction of the ceiling was based on our commitment to this principle. The ceiling is a political rather than a technical element in the scale. However, we were willing to review the ceiling and we listened to the arguments on their merits. We joined consensus on the resolution, since granting a reduction was clearly the express wish of the membership as a whole, and it is not the practice of our two delegations to block consensus. We are pleased that, having taken this political decision, we have also taken the corresponding political decision to spread the costs of the reduction to the membership equitably.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa05">It is the understanding of all delegations which participated in these scale negotiations that the reduction of the ceiling involved a bargain. In exchange for the reduction, the major contributor would pay its arrears. The membership of the Organization has acted. We call upon the major contributor to now fulfil its side of the bargain and to pay its arrears in full and without delay. We look forward to the speedy resolution of this issue so that the finances of the Organization can at last be placed on a sound footing. We also look forward to an improvement in the performance of all contributors, large and small, in paying their assessed contributions within the 30 days required by the United Nations financial regulations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa06">As a result of the decision we have just taken, our countries will face significant increases in our assessments. But, as has been the case in the past, our delegations remain committed to paying our assessments in full, on time and without conditions. We call on all others to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa07">In conclusion, Australia and New Zealand wish to record formally our strong appreciation to the Chairman of the Fifth Committee, Ambassador Rosenthal, and to the two coordinators, Ambassador Abelian of Armenia and Mr. Frank Smyth of Ireland, as well as to the Secretariat, for their dedication and patience in assisting Member States to bring these extremely difficult negotiations -- which, I would like to recall, we started more than two years ago -- to a satisfactory conclusion, and to achieve this historic agreement.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk04-pa01">Given the problems and challenges of today's world, the United Arab Emirates is concerned about strengthening the role of the United Nations. We therefore support the relevant draft resolutions relating to the financing of peacekeeping operations. The increase in our country's assessments is very significant indeed. Not only is it inequitable, but it is not in keeping with numerous international norms and principles in the financial and administrative fields. This is especially relevant given that our national economy is based on a non-renewable resource, oil.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk04-pa02">We are a developing country, and the demands of sustainable development continue to be very important as we try to strengthen the internal stability of our country. Despite these facts, given our awareness of the need to adopt resolutions by consensus on the peacekeeping and regular budgets, we support the draft resolutions, even though they do not in reality reflect the concerns of numerous developing countries, in particular those that continue to experience major financial difficulties. However, this is a historic event in the history of this international Organization, especially given the difficult conditions being experienced by numerous peoples and countries throughout the world. In that context, we would like to reaffirm that the United Arab Emirates will remain aware of the need to increase its contributions to this international Organization and its specialized agencies, despite all the conditions and difficulties to which I have referred.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk04-pa03">We have sent a letter to the Secretary-General with regard to the participation of our country in peacekeeping operations and to our contribution to the regular budget. Since 1998, we have continued to pay the same contribution, despite the enormous changes that have taken place in our country, including population growth, an increase in gross national product and a drop in individual per capita income, which today is about $14,460 per annum. We therefore hope that, when it considers the matter, the Committee on Contributions will take our situation into account in accordance with its modalities and procedures.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk04-pa04">In conclusion, we would like to wish you, Mr. President, and the Secretary-General, a happy new year, and we hope that peace, stability and happiness will embrace all humanity.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa01">It has been a very busy three and a half months for all of us, and I believe we should be quite satisfied with the results achieved. The Assembly has taken action on many important issues. I do not intend to go through all of them here. I will post a short summary on the work of the Committees and the plenary Assembly on my Web page for this purpose. For now, I would like to share some observations on the work done so far and thoughts on how we might want to go about our business next year.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa02">The Millennium Summit was the seminal event of this session of the General Assembly and set the agenda for our work. The main challenge for the Millennium Assembly was how to implement the Summit Declaration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa03">In my view, the Declaration is one of the most important documents of recent times. If we are able to achieve its targets, it will have an enormous impact globally.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa04">I am therefore very pleased that with the cooperation and support of all delegations we managed, in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-162.pdf">resolution 55/162</a>, to establish a follow-up mechanism to the Millennium Summit as an integral part of the ongoing work of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa05">It is also clear to me that in order to implement these goals the United Nations needs to open up. We need to enhance international cooperation, build bridges between societies and improve global governance. We need to reach out to other international and multilateral actors, such as the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade Organization and various regional organizations, as well as civil society as a whole. As I have stressed many times, the significance and relevance of the United Nations in the future will depend on our ability to involve our partners and civil society in our work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa06">In the past few weeks, two major items on the Assembly's agenda have dominated our discussions: what will the Assembly decide concerning the implementation of the Brahimi report, and will it agree to a new scale of assessments?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa07">As far as the Brahimi report is concerned, the Secretary-General's initiative to convene a high-level panel, followed by the report presented by the panel, was welcome and timely. The report is a valuable contribution to the efforts to strengthen one of the United Nations core functions: the maintenance of international peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa08">As the President of the General Assembly, I encouraged the Assembly to consider this extensive report in a speedy manner, and together with Member States we managed to reach agreement in the very short time of one month. Given the complexity of this issue and the time pressure, I think we can be quite satisfied with the results. Much-needed additional resources will be made available to the Secretariat. However, work will have to continue in the new year, and I trust there is the political will to complete the effort.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa09">During the past couple of weeks we had extremely difficult and complex negotiations on the scale of assessments. I myself made several appeals to delegations to come up with a substantive negotiated agreement -- by consensus -- on the two scales of assessment. That a compromise was finally reached shows that delegations put the interests of the Organization above everything else and understood the seriousness of the consequences to the Organization of a failure to reach consensus on this critical issue. I commend delegations for the outcome reached today.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa10">Throughout this session an important concern of mine has been to find ways to improve the functioning of the General Assembly itself. I have tried to work in an open and transparent way with my colleagues and to foster a collaborative spirit. I have instituted some changes, such as amending the rules to establish the dates for the opening of the Assembly's session each year. I am looking at ways to streamline the Assembly's huge agenda, and I will be working on this and other proposals next year. In order to guide this process and to give it some focus I intend to convene an informal brainstorming session of the General Committee some time in February. I will also prepare a non-paper in connection with the above-mentioned brainstorming session. I believe that several small steps, when combined, can actually have a big impact.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa11">Looking ahead to next year, we will have a full calendar of meetings and conferences. For my part, I will keep the momentum going through the special sessions of the General Assembly on human settlements and HIV/AIDS and the other activities of the General Assembly. Concerning the special session on HIV/AIDS, my office and I, with the help of two able facilitators, will have a central role in the preparatory process. I will also chair two working groups that will start meeting next year: on Security Council reform and concerning Africa's special needs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa12">One observation that I have made during my tenure -- having come to the United Nations from the outside -- has to do with the resources of the Organization. The United Nations is clearly underfunded and in desperate need of more adequate resources. Years of zero nominal growth have taken their toll. It is a policy that has clearly come to the end of its usefulness.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa13">All in all, we have all worked hard, and I am sure you are looking forward to a well-deserved break. Before we take that break, let me say a word of thanks. First of all I should like to thank all Ambassadors and other representatives for their cooperation. Special thanks go to the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly, as well as to the Chairpersons and Bureaux of the Main Committees and working groups -- not least to Ambassador Gert Rosenthal, who chaired a historic session of the Fifth Committee -- for their valuable cooperation and leadership in bringing our work to conclusion. They have shown that the Millennium Summit has indeed created a momentum and a new spirit of political will that will help us achieve the goals set in the Declaration. I trust that this kind of consensus-building and teamwork will help us resolve the challenges ahead.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa14">I should also like to extend my thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the Secretariat as a whole. In particular, I wish to thank the hard-working staff of the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, under the able leadership of Under-Secretary-General Jin Yongjian. Special thanks go to the teams of Mr. Vadim Perfiliev and Mr. Ozdinch Mustafa, as well as to our interpreters, conference room officers and documentation officers. Without them, our meetings would not have been possible. My team and I are deeply grateful to all of them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa15">Finally, I wish to thank the media, which have followed our agenda this session. Through them, I hope, we have been able to convey a more open and more easily understandable picture of the work of the General Assembly to the general public.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk12-pa16">I would like to wish you a very happy holiday, and I look forward to working with you in the new year.</div>
