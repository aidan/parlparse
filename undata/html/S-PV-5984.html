	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Germany, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2008-624.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2008/624</a>, which contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by Belgium, China, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">It is my understand that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Natalegawa</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Indonesia's principled position with regard to the issue before the Council remains. First, it is imperative to find a peaceful solution to any question related to nuclear non-proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Secondly, any solution must be guided by the need to protect the integrity of multilateral arrangements, in particular the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is fundamentally based upon three main pillars, namely non-proliferation, the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear disarmament.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Thirdly, Indonesia has full confidence in the credibility, independence and efficiency of the International Atomic Energy Agency as the sole competent authority for the verification of the respective safeguard obligations of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The present draft resolution does not provide for additional sanctions against Iran. If it did, we would not have been able to support it. The draft resolution reaffirms previous statements and resolutions and calls on Iran to comply fully with its obligations under those resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">However, it would not have sufficed to stop there. As a matter of principle, Indonesia attaches the greatest weight to a negotiated solution of the issue. It is our firm belief that negotiations and dialogue offer the best chance for a solution. My delegation therefore appreciates the incorporation of its amendment reaffirming the commitment to a negotiated solution of the issue as part of the dual-track approach. Such a dual-track approach must have the same common objectives and must not cancel one another out. An atmosphere conducive to the negotiations must be nurtured and promoted.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">Indonesia shall work earnestly to ensure that the Council's resolutions add value and do not lessen it, and that they provide incentives, and not disincentives, to negotiations. From our perspective, the draft resolution before us is, above all, a reaffirmation of the intrinsic promise of negotiation as a means to find solutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">For those considerations and reasons, Indonesia will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us today.</p>
