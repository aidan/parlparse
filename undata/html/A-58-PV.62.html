	<div class="p"> The General Assembly will elect 43 members of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, pursuant to resolutions 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, 3108 (XXVIII) of 12 December 1973, 31/99 of 15 December 1976 and 57/20 of 19 November 2002.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly will turn first to the election of 19 members to replace those members whose term of office expires on 13 June 2004, the last day prior to the opening of the thirty-seventh session of the Commission. The General Assembly will then proceed to the election of 24 additional members of the Commission, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-20.pdf">resolution 57/20</a> of 19 November 2002.</div>
	<div class="p">After the election of the 24 additional members, the President of the General Assembly shall draw lots to select 13 from among the 24 additional members, whose terms of office shall expire on the last day prior to the beginning of the fortieth session of the Commission, in 2007.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of 19 members to replace those members whose term of office expires on 13 June 2004. The 19 outgoing members are: Austria, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Fiji, Honduras, Hungary, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Kenya, Lithuania, Paraguay, Romania, Spain, the Sudan, Thailand, Uganda, the United States of America and Uruguay. Those members are eligible for immediate re-election.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to remind members that, as of 14 June 2004, the following States will continue to be represented on the Commission: Benin, Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, the Russian Federation, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Sweden, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Those 17 States are therefore not eligible.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be no nominations. I should like to recall, however, paragraph 16 of General Assembly decision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing with the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs when the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled should become standard, unless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a given election.</div>

	<div class="p"> Members will recall that the General Assembly held the debate on this agenda item at its 57th and 59th meetings, on 5 and 10 November 2003.</div>
	<div class="p">In connection with this item, the Assembly has before it a draft resolution issued as document <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.15.pdf">A/58/L.15</a>.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Choisuren" nation="Mongolia" language="">
	Mr. Choisuren (Mongolia)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">My delegation has the honour to introduce, on behalf of its sponsors, draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.15.pdf">A/58/L.15</a>, entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies".</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution has been prepared on the basis of a previous resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session in December 2001 and modified to take into account the activities undertaken by the United Nations and Member States over the past two years.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish also to inform the Assembly that, on 28 October, informal consultations were organized by our delegation with the draft resolution's sponsors to finalize its text.</div>
	<div class="p">As the Secretary-General noted in his report on this agenda item, the survey of the democratic assistance given by the United Nations system to new or restored democracies clearly demonstrates the widened scope of the Organization's involvement in promoting democratization.</div>
	<div class="p">The Ulaanbaatar Conference of New or Restored Democracies has also given new momentum to pursue the Organization's emerging democratization agenda. But there is still much more to be done to make the work of the United Nations system in support of democracy more integrated and effective.</div>
	<div class="p">Therefore, in the draft resolution, the General Assembly, while recognizing once again the important role of the United Nations in providing timely, appropriate and coherent sport to the efforts of Governments and commending the activities undertaken, encourages the Secretary-General to continue to improve the capacity of the Organization to respond effectively to the requests of the Member States.</div>
	<div class="p">The Secretary-General further underlines, in his concluding observations, that, although democratic government differs from country to country, a more coherent approach to democratization is certainly needed, one which requires a global dialogue on common challenges and practices of governance in the twenty-first century.</div>
	<div class="p">International cooperation also needs to be strengthened, along with the tools to carry out the work in that field. The Assembly debate that took place on this agenda item reaffirmed this need and underlined in that regard the importance of ensuring effective follow-up to the Fifth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies.</div>
	<div class="p">In operative paragraph 3, the draft resolution therefore encourages Member States, the relevant organizations of the United Nations system, other international organizations, national parliaments and non-governmental organizations to contribute actively to the follow-up and to make additional efforts to identify possible steps in support of the efforts of Governments, including those set out in the Ulaanbaatar Declaration and Plan of Action.</div>
	<div class="p">As His Excellency Mr. Luvsangiin Erdenechuluun, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mongolia and President of the Fifth Conference, indicated in his statement to the General Assembly (see <a href="../pdf/A-58-PV.57.pdf">A/58/PV.57</a>), the Conference presidency will place particular focus on efforts to implement the recommendations adopted by the Conference. He also shared some preliminary ideas on how to ensure more effective and efficient follow-up. In this regard, I wish to reiterate the importance my country attaches to the support and cooperation of Member States, the United Nations and other international organizations and non-governmental organizations in implementing their follow-up activities.</div>
	<div class="p">During the consultations on the draft resolution before us, several delegations put forward constructive ideas and proposals that further improve the text. Still, at the request of some of the sponsors, I wish to make a small revision to paragraph 3 of the draft resolution. After the words "national parliaments", the text ", including" should be added. And after the words "Inter-Parliamentary Union". the text "and other parliamentary organizations," should be added.</div>
	<div class="p">At the time the draft resolution was published, 84 countries were sponsors. Another 42 countries have since joined as sponsors. They are: Antigua and Barbuda, Azerbaijan, Belize, Cape Verde, Chad, Colombia, Croatia, Djibouti, Dominica, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, Gabon, Georgia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Iceland, Kenya, Latvia, Lesotho, Madagascar, the Marshall Islands, Mauritania, the Federated States of Micronesia, Niger, Pakistan, the Republic of Moldova, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Serbia and Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Suriname, Switzerland, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Venezuela and Zambia. This brings the total number of sponsors to 126. I hope that today many more countries will join in sponsoring the draft resolution. That would be another energetic demonstration of the international community's support for the efforts of Governments to achieve democratization in their respective countries and in the international arena as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p">On behalf of all of the sponsors, I express our hope that draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.15.pdf">A/58/L.15</a>, as orally revised, will receive, as similar texts have received in the past, the unanimous support of the Assembly and will be adopted without a vote.</div>

Italy, Peru and Romania also associate themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p">The Community of Democracies was launched in June 2000 at a ministerial conference in Warsaw, Poland, where more than 100 countries pledged to uphold the democratic principles outlined in the Warsaw Declaration. At its recent ministerial meeting held here during the General Assembly session, on 26 September, the convening group stressed the adherence of the Community of Democracies to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and fundamental principles of international law. They also emphasized the interdependence among peace, development, human rights and democracy, and reiterated the commitment of the Community of Democracies to the continued development of democracy at the national, regional and global levels. Furthermore, the members of the convening group recalled the Warsaw Declaration commitment that the Community of Democracies will collaborate on democracy-related issues in existing international and regional institutions.</div>
	<div class="p">It is on the basis of the aforementioned that the convening group of the caucus of democracies supported the draft resolution in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.15.pdf">A/58/L.15</a>, entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies" and introduced by Mongolia, as an important contribution to our common purpose.</div>
