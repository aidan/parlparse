	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">May I also express the hope that the international community will demonstrate its usual solidarity by responding promptly and generously to any request from these countries for assistance in their present plight.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">In the face of this massive tragedy, Mozambique will require many years of sustained assistance from external sources, in order to be able to rebuild infrastructure, schools, hospitals and houses.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa01">Members will recall that, at its 70th meeting on 6 December 1999, the General Assembly decided to reopen consideration of this sub-item.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa02">In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1278(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1278 (1999)</a> adopted by the Security Council on 30 November 1999, the General Assembly will proceed to the election of a member of the International Court of Justice for the unexpired term of office of Judge Stephen Schwebel, whose resignation took effect on 29 February 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa03">In connection with this election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the members of the General Assembly:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa04">First, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 264 (III) of 8 October 1948, a State which is a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice, but not a Member of the United Nations, shall participate in the General Assembly in electing the members of the Court in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. Therefore, on this occasion, the representative of Switzerland may participate in the election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa05">Secondly, I should like to confirm that, at this time, the Security Council, independently of the General Assembly, is also proceeding to elect one member of the Court. This procedure is in accordance with article 8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa06">"The General Assembly and the Security Council shall proceed independently of one another to elect the members of the Court."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa07">Accordingly, the results of the voting in the General Assembly will not be communicated to the Security Council until one candidate has obtained the required majority in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa08">Thirdly, I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The Assembly has before it <a href="../pdf/A-54-750.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/750</a>, which contains a memorandum by the Secretary-General on the present composition of the Court and the procedure to be followed in the General Assembly and in the Security Council with regard to the election; <a href="../pdf/A-54-751.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/751</a>, which contains the name of the candidate who has been nominated by national groups within the required time for submission, that is, by 7 February 2000; and addendums 1 and 2, which contain additional information regarding nominations received from national groups after 7 February; as well as <a href="../pdf/A-54-752.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/752</a>, which contains the curriculum vitae of the candidate nominated by national groups.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa09">In accordance with article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa10">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General Assembly are all 188 Member States, plus the one non-Member State which is a party to the Statute of the Court, namely Switzerland, for a total of 189 electors. Accordingly, for the present election, 95 votes constitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa11">The General Assembly will now proceed to a secret ballot. If in the first ballot no candidate obtains an absolute majority, it will be necessary to proceed to other ballots until a candidate has obtained the required majority. Pursuant to the decision taken by the General Assembly at its 915th meeting, held on 16 November 1960, these ballots shall be unrestricted.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa12">I should like to remind representatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the Assembly's rules of procedure,</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa13">"After the President has announced the beginning of voting, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order in connection with the actual conduct of the voting."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa14">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to the procedures I have just outlined?</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">"I have the honour to inform you that at the 4107th meeting of the Security Council, held on 2 March 2000, for the purpose of electing a member of the International Court of Justice for a term of office to expire on 5 February 2006, Mr. Thomas Buergenthal obtained an absolute majority of votes."</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">As a result of the independent voting in the Security Council and in the General Assembly, Mr. Thomas Buergenthal has obtained an absolute majority in both organs. He is therefore duly elected a member of the International Court of Justice, to serve for a term of office commencing on 2 March 2000 and ending on 5 February 2006.
