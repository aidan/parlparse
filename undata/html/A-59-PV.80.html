	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa01">In his letter, the Secretary-General informs the Assembly that the term of office of the members of the current pool of ad litem judges of the Tribunal will come to an end on 11 June 2005 and that they are not eligible for re-election. He further advises that, of the nine ad litem judges who are currently serving in the Tribunal, two are adjudicating in a case that was due to finish within the next two weeks. The case is now finished. The other seven, however, are adjudicating in cases which are anticipated to continue beyond 11 June 2005.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa02">Ad litem judges Brydensholt and Eser are currently adjudicating in the Ori case. It is anticipated that the hearings in that case will be completed and judgement handed down in November 2005.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa03">Ad litem judges Rasoazanany and Swart are adjudicating in the trial of the Hadzihasanovi case. It is anticipated that hearings in that case will be completed and judgement handed down in September 2005.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa04">Ad litem judges Thelin and Van den Wyngaert are adjudicating in the trial of the Limaj case. It is anticipated that hearings in that case will be completed and judgement handed down in November 2005.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa05">Ad litem judge Canivell is adjudicating in the trial of the Krajisnik case. It is anticipated that hearings in the case should be completed and judgement handed down in April 2006.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa06">In the absence of any provision in the statute of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia whereby judges continue to discharge their duties until they are replaced and, thereafter, until they finish any cases that they may have begun, the approval of the Security Council, as the parent organ of the Tribunal, and of the General Assembly, as the organ that elects its judges, would be needed in order to permit the seven ad litem judges concerned to continue to serve in the Tribunal beyond 11 June 2005 and to finish the cases in which they are currently adjudicating, notwithstanding the expiry of their terms of office.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa07">The Secretary-General further informs the Assembly that he has received requests from Judge Meron, President of the International Tribunal, to appoint two additional members from the current pool of ad litem judges to serve in the Tribunal for trying cases. In both cases, it is anticipated that the trials concerned will continue beyond 11 June 2005.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa08">The Secretary-General was requested to appoint ad litem judge Szénási to serve in the Tribunal for the trial of the Halilovi case. The trial is ready to commence on 24 January 2005 and judgement would be handed down in October 2005.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa09">The Secretary-General has also been requested to appoint ad litem judge Hanoteau to serve in the Tribunal for the trial of the Krajisnik case in time for hearings to be able to resume as early as 14 February 2005. It is anticipated that proceedings in the case would be completed and judgement handed down in April 2006.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa10">The Secretary-General considers that it would be highly desirable for the Security Council and the General Assembly first to agree that the judges concerned, if appointed, may continue to serve in the Tribunal for the trials of the two cases in question and to finish those trials, notwithstanding the expiry of their term of office.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa11">In the letter addressed to the President of the General Assembly contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-59-676.pdf">A/59/676</a>, the President of the Security Council draws attention to Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1581(2005).pdf">resolution 1581 (2005)</a> of 18 January 2005, whereby the Council, inter alia:</div>
