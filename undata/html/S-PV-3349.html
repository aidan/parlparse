	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-900(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 900 (1994)</a>. That report is contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-291.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/291</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council also to <a href="../pdf/S-1994-293.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/293</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 11 March 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council remains gravely concerned at the continuing hostilities in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It especially deplores the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Maglaj area and the threat it poses to the survival of the remaining civilian population. It notes that this intolerable situation has been perpetuated by the intensity of the nine-month siege of the town, for which the Bosnian Serb party is primarily responsible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Security Council strongly condemns the indiscriminate shelling by the Bosnian Serb party of the civilian population of Maglaj, which has resulted in heavy casualties, loss of life and material destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Security Council notes with particular concern reports of the recurrent obstruction and looting of humanitarian aid convoys destined for the civilian population of Maglaj, including the most recent incident which took place on 10 March 1994, in which six aid trucks were prevented from reaching the town. It is appalled that not one convoy has reached the town since 25 October 1993. The Council notes that the civilian population has been totally dependent on airdrops and commends those who have provided these vital missions. The Council demands that the Bosnian Serb party and the Bosnian Croat party allow forthwith and without conditions passage to all humanitarian convoys, and the immediate evacuation of those in need of urgent medical attention. The Council also demands that the siege of Maglaj be ended immediately.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the fact that United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) personnel have now obtained access to Maglaj. It demands that the Bosnian Serb party permit unimpeded and continuing access by UNPROFOR to Maglaj.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;The Security Council also condemns recent attacks against the personnel of UNPROFOR as well as of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations. It reiterates its demands that all parties ensure the safety and security of UNPROFOR, as well as all other United Nations personnel and those of non-governmental organizations, and their unimpeded freedom of movement throughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">&quot;The Council affirms its determination to maintain and build upon the recent positive developments towards peace in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in this context notes the importance of protecting Maglaj and its civilian population from further hostilities. It will consider the situation in Maglaj further in the context of its examination of the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-291.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/291</a>) pursuant to its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-900(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 900 (1994)</a>.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-11.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/11</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
