	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">May I invite the General Assembly to direct its attention to section I of the report of the General Committee. In that section, the Committee took note of the information contained in paragraph 2.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">May I request the General Assembly now to direct its attention to section II, entitled "Organization of the session", which contains a number of recommendations concerning the General Committee, rationalization of work, the opening and closing dates for the session, the schedule of meetings, the general debate, the conduct of meetings, et cetera. In paragraph 16, the General Committee recommends that the general debate be held from Tuesday, 23 September to Saturday 27 September and on Monday, 29 September 2008.</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">I wish to inform members that, in connection with the recommendation of the General Committee that the General Assembly hold the general debate on Saturday, 27 September 2008, I should like to put on record the following statement of financial implications on behalf of the Secretary-General, in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">The holding of the general debate of the General Assembly on Saturday 27 September 2008 had not been planned, though regular meetings servicing requirements for the general debate during weekdays have been provided for within the official calendar of conferences. Therefore, meeting on a Saturday implies overtime compensation for meetings servicing and other related staff. Accordingly, resources related to overtime for meeting servicing staff would be required.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">In addition, other related staff from the Office of the Central Support Services, the Department of Safety and Security and the Department of Public Information would be required to provide sound engineering, safety and security, press coverage, webcasting, and radio and television services, broken down as follows: section 2 -- General  Assembly  affairs  and  Economic  and Social Council affairs and conference management: $58,400; section 27 -- Public information: $25,100; section 28 D -- Office of Central Support Services: $5,000; and section 33 -- Safety and security: $10,000; for a total of $98,500.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">No provisions have been made under the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 for servicing the general debate of the General Assembly on a Saturday. Should the plan to hold the general debate of the General Assembly on Saturday, 27 September 2008 be adopted, indicative additional conference servicing and other requirements of $98,500 would arise. All efforts will be made to meet the requirements within the provisions under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management; section 27, Public information; section 28 D, Office of Central Support Services; and section 33, Safety and security, of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">Japan has no problem with having a general debate on a Saturday. However, we have difficulty accepting the financial implications just mentioned by the representative of the Secretariat. It is our understanding that, if the debate were to take place on Saturday, the cost would be absorbed by currently existing financial resources. Therefore, we cannot join the consensus of having the general debate on Saturday without clearance of the budgetary implications.</p>

According to that rule, I am required to brief the General Assembly on the figures I indicated for a total of $98,500. At the same time, on behalf of the Secretary-General, I said that all efforts will be made to meet the requirements within the provisions of the available budget under the relevant sections. Thus, my statement did not mean that those would be extra expenses.</p>
