	<div class="p">The General Assembly will now resume its consideration of agenda item 18. In this connection, I wish to refer to the letter from the Secretary-General dated 16 April 2003, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/57/790">A/57/790</a> and to which is annexed a letter dated 26 March 2003 from the President of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. In her letter, the President of the International Criminal Tribunal requests that the terms of office of both Judge Pavel Dolenc and Judge Yakov Arkadyevich Ostrovsky be extended so that they might finish the <i>Cyangugu</i> case, that is, for an additional nine months. She also requests that the term of office of Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu be extended so that he might finish the <i>Kajelijeli, Kamuhanda</i> and <i>Butare</i> cases, that is, for a total of two years and seven months. She further requests that her own term of office be extended so that she might finish the <i>Media</i> case, that is, for an additional seven months.</div>
	<div class="p">In a letter dated 19 May 2003 addressed to the President of the General Assembly and contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/57/814">A/57/814</a>, the President of the Security Council transmits the text of Council resolution 1482 (2003) of 19 May 2003, whereby the Council, inter alia:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"1. <i>Decides</i> in response to the request by the Secretary-General that:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"(a) Judge Dolenc, once replaced as a member of the Tribunal, finish the <i>Cyangugu</i> case which he has begun before expiry of his term of office;</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"(b) Judge Maqutu, once replaced as a member of the Tribunal, finish the <i>Kajelijeli</i> and <i>Kamuhanda</i> cases which he has begun before expiry of his term of office;</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"(c) Notwithstanding Article 11, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Tribunal and on an exceptional basis, Judge Ostrovsky, once replaced as a member of the Tribunal, finish the <i>Cyangugu</i> case which he has begun before the expiry of his term of office;</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"(d) Judge Pillay, once replaced as a member of the Tribunal, finish the <i>Media</i> case which she has begun before expiry of her term of office;</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"2. <i>Takes note </i>in this regard of the intention of the Tribunal to finish the <i>Cyangugu</i> case before the end of February 2004 and the <i>Kajelijeli, Kamuhanda</i> and <i>Media</i> cases before the end of December 2003".</div>

	<div class="p"><b> </b>I would like to inform members that, should the General Assembly decide to extend the term of office of Judges Pillay and Maqutu to 31 December 2003 and Judges Dolenc and Ostrovsky to 29 February 2004, as endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 1482 (2003), additional costs provisionally estimated at $1,281,500 would arise. It is anticipated that of that amount the cost pertaining to the year 2003, estimated at $975,470, could be met within the appropriations for 2002-2003, as adopted by the General Assembly in its <a href="../pdf/A/RES/56/248">resolution 56/248</a> B.

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">At the outset, my delegation would like to join the Acting President in expressing sincere condolences to the Governments and the peoples of Algeria and Sri Lanka for the tragic loss of life in the flooding in Sri Lanka and the earthquake in Algeria.</div>
	<div class="p">As I stand before the Assembly, somewhere in the world, in countries represented here, road accidents are taking place. A number of people are getting killed, and an even greater number of people are getting injured, some of whom will go on to have life-long disabilities. Globally, road traffic accidents cause 1.2 million deaths and injure 10 to 15 million people every year. It is projected that by 2020 road traffic injuries will account for about 2.3 million deaths worldwide, with more than 90 per cent of those deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries.</div>
	<div class="p">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 1998 road traffic crashes accounted for 2.8 per cent of all global deaths, and ranked ninth among the leading causes of disease burden. By the year 2020, road traffic injuries could take third place in the ranking of disease burden. The annual cost of road traffic accidents is a staggering $500 billion, with Africa alone bearing one fifth of that cost, funds badly needed for development projects.</div>
	<div class="p">Yet, the issue of road traffic safety is not significantly on the international public policy agenda at all. The leadership of the international community largely ignores road safety. Take, for example, the World Summit on Sustainable Development, which was held at Johannesburg last September. The Plan of Implementation adopted at the Summit included a number of specific goals and targets related to the environmental impact of transport. But the Plan does not specifically mention road safety even once. The thousands of deaths occurring daily around the world do not receive the same media attention as, say, a single aircraft crash with a loss of about 200 lives. Given the expected increase in the level of motor vehicle use and the resulting growth in road traffic deaths and injuries, action to reduce this dramatic rise in casualties should now be a significant priority for the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">An excellent start has been made with the decision of the General Assembly to include an item on road safety on the agenda of the fifty-seventh session. The General Assembly will, for the very first time, discuss road safety. Another welcome development is the decision of the World Health Organization to dedicate World Health Day in 2004 to the theme of safer roads. There is still much more that needs to be done to raise awareness of the issue of road safety and to develop prevention strategies based on effective approaches to road safety management.</div>
	<div class="p">Valuable work on road safety is being undertaken by WHO, the World Bank, the United Nations Children's Fund, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Global Road Safety Partnership, the Bone and Joint Decade and the Task Force for Child Survival and Development, just to name a few. What is lacking, unfortunately, is coordination between them. Work undertaken by United Nations agencies lacks defined goals set at the political level by the international community. That lack of a clearly established mandate prevents the development of a coherent strategy for road safety management. The sponsors of the draft resolution before the Assembly this morning therefore believe that there is an urgent need for a new initiative that can pull together the various efforts of different agencies and provide a single focal point for global road safety.</div>
	<div class="p">I have the honour to introduce the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A/57/L.77">A/57/L.77</a>, entitled "Global road safety crisis", on behalf of the following other sponsors: Algeria, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Cambodia, China, Cyprus, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Fiji, France, Gabon, Greece, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, Singapore, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America, Uruguay, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen and Zambia.</div>
	<div class="p">The preambular paragraphs of the draft resolution recognize the magnitude of the problem and its contributing factors. In its operative part, paragraph 4 will request the Secretary-General to submit a report containing the views expressed by Member States and United Nations agencies that will form the basis for discussion during the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">I commend to the General Assembly the adoption of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A/57/L.77">A/57/L.77</a>. By adopting it, we would be starting, in small way, to move towards making our roads safe for ourselves and for generations to come.</div>
