	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1998-287.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1998/287</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 31 March 1998 from the Chargé d'affaires <i>ad interim </i>of the Permanent Mission of Papua New Guinea to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting a letter dated 30 March 1998 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Papua New Guinea addressed to the President of the Security Council, conveying copies of the Lincoln Agreement on Peace, Security and Development on Bougainville and the Burnham Truce.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council, taking note of the development of the Bougainville conflict, strongly supports the Agreement on Peace, Security and Development on Bougainville, signed at Lincoln University, New Zealand, on 23 January 1998 (the Lincoln Agreement) contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1998-287.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1998/287</a>, achieved by the Government of Papua New Guinea, the Bougainville Transitional Government, the Bougainville Resistance Force, the Bougainville Interim Government, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army and the Bougainville leaders, with regard to a ceasefire among conflicting parties.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the extension of the period of truce, and welcomes further a permanent and irrevocable ceasefire which will take effect on 30 April 1998 as stipulated in the Lincoln Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council encourages all parties to cooperate in promoting reconciliation, so that the objectives of the Lincoln Agreement can be met, and urges all parties to continue to cooperate, in accordance with the Lincoln Agreement, namely, to achieve and maintain peace, to renounce the use of armed force and violence, to resolve any differences by consultation, both now and in the future, and to confirm their respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council commends the efforts of countries in the region for the resolution of the conflict, and welcomes the establishment, as outlined in the Lincoln Agreement, of the peace monitoring group composed of civilian and military personnel from Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu, the mandate of which is to monitor the implementation of the said Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council notes that the Lincoln Agreement calls for the United Nations to play a role in Bougainville, and requests the Secretary-General to consider the composition and financial modalities of such involvement by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council will remain seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1998-10.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1998/10</a>.</p>
