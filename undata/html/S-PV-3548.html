	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council reiterates its condemnation of interference with humanitarian supplies and the freedom of movement of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) by all parties within the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this context it is deeply concerned by the blockading by Bosnian Government forces of UNPROFOR personnel in the Visoko, Gorazde, Gorni Vakuf and Kladanj areas, which included on 20 June 1995 placing mines outside the UNPROFOR camp in Visoko. The Council is also deeply concerned at the deterioration in the situation in and around Sarajevo, the obstruction by the Bosnian Serb party of freedom of movement and utilities to the city and the continued obstruction of the normal operation of Sarajevo airport.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council stresses that all such actions are unacceptable and demands that all parties fully respect the safety and security of UNPROFOR personnel and ensure their complete freedom of movement to enable UNPROFOR to carry out its mandate in accordance with the Council's resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council calls upon the parties to enter into negotiations as provided for in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-998(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 998 (1995)</a> of 16 June 1995 and to agree without further delay to a cease-fire and a complete cessation of hostilities in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council emphasizes that there can be no military solution to the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It stresses the importance it attaches to the vigorous pursuit of a political settlement, and reiterates its demand that the Bosnian Serb party accept the Contact Group peace plan as a starting point."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-31.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/31</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
