	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">&quot;The Security Council underlines its support for the 8 June 1994 Agreement of the parties to the conflict, in which they agreed to observe a cease-fire for a period of one month starting from 10 June 1994. The Council expresses its grave concern at the parties' failure to comply with the Agreement to date.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council calls once again on the parties to stop all offensive military operations and other provocative actions, as well as all cease-fire violations and ethnic cleansing, and to cooperate with the Secretary-General's Special Representative for the Former Yugoslavia and the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). It also calls on the parties to resume negotiations on a comprehensive cessation of hostilities for the entire territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a view to reaching agreement before the expiration of the 8 June Agreement on 10 July 1994 while continuing negotiations to achieve a just and comprehensive peace agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council deplores all attacks on United Nations personnel and calls on those responsible to ensure that such attacks do not take place. It also condemns the restrictions imposed on UNPROFOR's freedom of movement and demands that these restrictions be immediately lifted, so as to enable UNPROFOR to assist in the implementation of the 8 June Agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-31.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/31</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
