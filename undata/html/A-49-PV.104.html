	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa01"> In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-979(1995).pdf">resolution 979 (1995)</a>, adopted by the Security Council on 9 March 1995, the General Assembly will proceed this morning to the election of a member of the International Court of Justice for the unexpired term of office of the deceased Judge Roberto Ago of Italy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa02">In connection with this election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the members of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Firstly, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 264 (III) of 8 October 1948, a State which is a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice but not a Member of the United Nations shall participate in the General Assembly in electing the members of the Court in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. On this occasion I am happy to welcome here the representatives of Nauru and Switzerland.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Secondly, I should like to confirm that at this time the Security Council, independently of the General Assembly, is also proceeding to elect one member of the Court. This procedure is in accordance with Article 8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The General Assembly and the Security Council shall proceed independently of one another to elect the members of the Court."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa06">Accordingly, the results of the voting in the General Assembly will not be communicated to the Security Council until one candidate has obtained the required majority in the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa07">Thirdly, I should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The Assembly has before it document <a href="../pdf/A-49-909.pdf">A/49/909</a>, which contains a memorandum by the Secretary-General on the present composition of the Court and the procedure to be followed in the General Assembly and in the Security Council with regard to the election; document <a href="../pdf/A-49-910.pdf">A/49/910</a>, which contains the names of the candidates who have been nominated by national groups within the required time for submission, that is, by 31 May 1995, and documents <a href="../pdf/A-49-921.pdf">A/49/921</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-49-921-Add.1.pdf">A/49/921/Add.1</a>, providing information concerning nominations received from national groups after 31 May 1995; and document <a href="../pdf/A-49-911.pdf">A/49/911</a>, which contains the curricula vitae of candidates nominated by national groups.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa08">In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa09">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose, are all the Member States -- 185 -- and two non-Member States, Nauru and Switzerland. Accordingly, 94 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of electing a judge of the International Court of Justice.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The General Assembly will now proceed to a secret ballot. If in the first ballot no candidate obtains an absolute majority, it will be necessary to proceed to further ballots until a candidate has obtained that majority. Pursuant to the decision taken by the General Assembly at its 915th meeting, held on 16 November 1960, these ballots shall be unrestricted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa11">I should like to remind representatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the Assembly's rules of procedure,</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"After the President has announced the beginning of voting, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order in connection with the actual conduct of the voting".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa13">Therefore, any announcements, such as those concerning withdrawals of candidatures, should be made prior to the commencement of the voting process, that is, before the distribution of ballot papers.</div>
