	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">&quot;The members of the Security Council have noted with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-856.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/856</a>) submitted in conformity with resolution 895 of 28 January 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">&quot;They reaffirm their commitment to the full sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries. In this context, they assert that any State shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;As the Security Council extends the mandate of UNIFIL for a further interim period on the basis of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 425 (1978)</a>, the members of the Council again stress the urgent need for the implementation of that resolution in all its aspects. They reiterate their full support for the Taif Agreement and for the continued efforts of the Lebanese Government to consolidate peace, national unity and security in the country, while successfully carrying out the reconstruction process. The members of the Council commend the Lebanese Government for its successful efforts to extend its authority in the south of the country in full coordination with UNIFIL.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The members of the Security Council express their concern over the continuing violence in southern Lebanon, regret the loss of civilian life, and urge all parties to exercise restraint.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The members of the Security Council take this opportunity to express their appreciation for the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General and his staff in this regard and commend UNIFIL's troops and troop-contributing countries for their sacrifices and commitment to the cause of international peace and security under difficult circumstances.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-37.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/37</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
