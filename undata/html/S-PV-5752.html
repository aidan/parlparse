I am sure I speak for all members of the Council in expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Ripert for the great diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council's business last month.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council was briefed on 1 October on the recent attack on African Union peacekeepers in Haskanita, South Darfur, Sudan, reportedly committed by a rebel group. The Council condemns this murderous attack and demands that no effort be spared so that the perpetrators be identified and brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council deplores the loss of life and injuries that resulted from this attack, and conveys its sympathy to the Governments, families and colleagues of those killed and injured.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its support for the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) and commends the dedication of its personnel and expresses its appreciation for those countries which contribute troops to AMIS.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council recalls the demand in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a> on all parties for an immediate cessation of hostilities and attacks on AMIS, civilians and humanitarian agencies. The Council insists that all parties in the Sudan comply with this demand and cooperate fully with the deployment of the United Nations Light and Heavy Support Packages to AMIS, and with the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council deplores the fact that this attack took place on the eve of the peace talks starting on 27 October in Tripoli, under the chairmanship of the United Nations and the African Union. The Council underlines that any attempt to undermine the peace process is unacceptable."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-35.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/35</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
