<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Denisov</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">As Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), I would like, at today's meeting, to inform the Security Council about the Committee's activities during the past three months, as well as to introduce the fourteenth work programme for the next 90-day period, namely, from 1 January to 31 March 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Before making my briefing, I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the delegations of Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain for their outstanding contributions to the work of the Committee during their membership of the Security Council. I would also like to welcome the delegations of Argentina, Denmark, Greece, Japan and the United Republic of Tanzania, which have already participated actively in the activities of the CTC as new members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I should like to begin the first open briefing of 2005 by reviewing the Council's work during 2004. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 1535 (2004)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1566 (2004)</a>, as well as other decision adopted by the Council, have created a new and more comprehensive and multifaceted agenda for the Council in the area of counter-terrorism. The Council's ongoing focus on various aspects of counter-terrorism has created additional challenges for the CTC. That requires additional efforts to accelerate the revitalization process as part of a changing agenda in the fight against terrorism, especially in terms of making the CTC's Executive Directorate (CTED) fully operational.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The Committee has also focused particular attention on building up the Committee's capacity by developing new practical ways and means to carry out more effective monitoring of Member States' implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. I would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the Executive Director of the CTED, Mr. Javier Rupérez, and his staff for their useful work and valuable contribution to the work of the Committee. During the period covered by the thirteenth work programme, the CTC has continued to rely upon the support of the Secretariat. We are extremely grateful to the entire staff of the Secretariat for its assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Reviewing the reports submitted to the Committee by Member States in conformity with paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and maintaining a regular dialogue with States have continued to be the primary means by which the CTC has monitored the implementation of the provisions of the resolution and built up the capacity of States in the area of counter-terrorism. The Committee had received 551 reports from Member States and other entities by 31 December 2004. That included the first reports from 191 Member States and six reports from other entities, 160 second reports from Member States and two reports from other entities, 119 third reports from Member States and one report from another entity, and 72 fourth reports from Member States. I should note that, in the coming months, the CTC will receive the fifth series of reports from a number of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">At the same time, however, an analysis of the CTC's experience with regard to reviewing Member States' reports has identified two problems that require that we take special measures to resolve. The first has to do with the shortage in the number of experts. We hope that problem will be resolved once the CTED becomes operational. The Committee had planned to review 40 reports during the period covered by the thirteenth work programme. However, the Committee actually surpassed that target, reviewing a total of 49 reports. Nevertheless, that is less than the 65 reports the Committee reviewed during previous 90-day periods. Another subject of concern in that regard pertains to the increase in the number of Member States that have failed to submit their reports in implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> to the Committee in a timely manner. On 16 December 2004, the Chairman of the CTC presented to the President of the Security Council an official list of 75 Member States that had not met their obligations under the timetable established to submit their reports to the CTC. I would like to emphasize that, operating through the CTED, the Committee is prepared to provide Member States with the necessary assistance and guidelines on issues relating to their implementation of the resolution, including assistance to guarantee the timely submission of reports. The CTC has also begun to review that problem in a broader context. Effective monitoring of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> calls for more than just reviewing reports; it requires additional means and resources.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The Committee has also continued to make efforts to develop new approaches to providing technical assistance. In that regard, the Committee is beginning to undertake analytical work to assess the assistance needs of Member States, with a view to including that analysis in the process of reviewing reports. Following the guidelines of the CTC, the experts of the CTED have already prepared first drafts of assessment letters to various Member States. With the consent of the States concerned, the Committee intends to provide such assessment data to interested donor States and organizations. The Committee will continue to carry out its work in accordance with that approach, strengthening the role of the CTC in the global coordination of technical assistance in order to enhance the effectiveness of such assistance and harmonize it with the actual needs of States. The Committee will also continue to update the Directory of Counter-Terrorism Information and Sources of Assistance and the Assistance Matrix, as important sources of information for Member States interested in receiving technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>, which reaffirmed the Security Council's appeal to all Member States to accede to the 12 international conventions and protocols related to terrorism, the CTC has continued to take steps to achieve that goal as a matter of priority. The Committee focused in particular on prompt ratification of all 12 conventions and on the importance of effectively incorporating their provisions into national legislation, regardless of whether or not a State is party to a regional convention related to terrorism. The CTC will continue to encourage Member States to accede to the 12 relevant international conventions and protocols and will regularly monitor progress in that area.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">With respect to the achievements of the Committee over the past three months, I should like to underscore the fact that the Committee has essentially completed its preparations for the CTC's first visit to several Member States, in implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1535 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1566 (2004)</a>, taking into account the particular importance of such visits to achieving the aim of the revitalization of the CTC. The Committee has accelerated its work to prepare for those visits, the first of which is slated for March of this year.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">Since November last, the CTC has been carrying out preliminary consultations with several Member States regarding a possible time-table and conditions for the implementation of CTC visits. The Committee is committed to the idea of implementing such visits to Member States in order to develop a deeper and more direct dialogue with national Governments, to enhance monitoring of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and to ensure a more accurate assessment of the capacities of States and of their needs in terms of technical assistance for the full implementation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">The CTC attaches great importance to broadening cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations, in accordance with the action plan agreed at the special meeting of the Committee on 6 March 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">During the period under review, the CTC actively prepared for its fourth special meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations. The Committee commends the proposal of the Commonwealth of Independent States jointly to organize that meeting in Almaty, Kazakhstan, from 26 to 28 January 2005, as well as the efforts of the Government of Kazakhstan to prepare for it.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">The Committee deems of particular importance the further development of its relations with international, regional and subregional organizations and will maintain the existing practical thrust of its measures in implementing the decisions of the Almaty meeting in order to strengthen the global counter-terrorism network.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">Over the last three months, the CTC has continued to abide by the fundamental principle of transparency in its work. The web page of the Committee has been regularly updated and improved. I should note that, thanks to the efforts of the Secretariat, it is currently accessible in all official languages of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>, the CTC was fully resolved to broaden its interaction and coordination with other structures of the United Nations involved in fighting terrorism. One example of this kind of cooperation was the participation of the CTC, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the seminar held in late November and early December 2004 in Paraguay on a draft resolution on counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">The Committee devoted particular attention to further cooperation with the Security Council committees involved in various aspects of the prevention of terrorism -- the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban, and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> on non-proliferation in the context of the threat of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">The Chairmen of the three committees have held informal meetings in order to find new areas of cooperation and coordination among the Committees. That approach has contributed to greater agreement in the implementation of a single, comprehensive strategy of the Security Council in the fight against terrorism. On that basis, the Chairmen of the Committees established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, respectively, were invited to take part in the fourth special meeting of the CTC in Almaty.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">Furthermore, the Committee has maintained cooperation between experts of the CTC and the Monitoring Group on sanctions against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The CTC will also seek to establish appropriate contacts with the newly appointed experts of the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, as well as the working group established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>. Such cooperation among the committees must take place in full compliance with the rules of procedure and the mandates of the relevant organs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">In conclusion, I would like to make several general comments regarding the fourteenth work programme of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">In the next three months, two practical tasks have a high priority -- first, implementation of the first visits to Member States, and, secondly, the convening of the fourth special meeting of the CTC with international, regional and subregional organizations in Almaty. However, all of the goals set forth in the programme can be achieved only on the condition that the CTED becomes fully operational as soon as possible. At this time, now that the CTED budget has been adopted and work on its administrative mechanisms has been completed, it is of particular importance to recruit in a timely manner experts and staff whose qualifications accord with the requirements and tasks related to the revitalization of the CTC.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Denisov for his comments and his comprehensive briefing.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Løj</span> <span class="nation">Denmark</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">I should like to thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Denisov, for his comprehensive briefing, which my delegation fully endorses. His able administration of the Committee's work is greatly appreciated. We support the ambitious 90-day work programme he has submitted, which includes well-established priorities. My Government also has high expectations for what the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED) can accomplish when established, and we note with great satisfaction that the CTED is breaking new ground.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">As Denmark fully associates itself with the forthcoming statement by my colleague, the Ambassador of Luxembourg, on behalf of the European Union, I would like to limit my intervention to a few brief points.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">First, I would like to express my Government's general support for the recommendations on counter-terrorism contained in the report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. In cruel and despicable ways, terrorism keeps reminding us how serious a threat it poses to international peace and security. A lot has been done by individual countries, as well as through multilateral cooperation -- including through the efforts of international, regional and subregional groups -- in limiting the terrorists' room to manoeuvre. But, as we all realize, this is only the beginning. We are facing a long and arduous battle that requires a sustained and multi-pronged approach.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">In this long-term endeavour, it is essential that the United Nations take the leading role. We agree that it is important to develop a comprehensive strategy to counter the threat of terrorism and look forward to making our contribution to implementing this recommendation of the High-level Panel.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">It is of great concern that a growing number of countries are falling behind in their reporting obligations. We recognize that reports alone do not stop the work of terrorists. Nevertheless, those reports remain the backbone of the CTC's ability to monitor the actual steps taken on the ground. It is therefore of particular concern that 31 countries have not submitted their second reports; in fact, those 31 countries are losing touch with the CTC. We realize that reporting can be a strain on already limited administrative resources. But in the light of the potential risk posed by terrorists exploiting loopholes, we urge those Governments to seek assistance in meeting their obligations rather than simply giving up.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">While the responsibility for reporting and implementing obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> lies with States, the CTC should also be creative in helping countries to overcome possible constraints in order to get back on track. The establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED) provides a much needed infusion of resources to Secretariat support for the CTC. The CTED is already at the starting block and will soon be up and running. We are hopeful that that will pave the way for a more substantial dialogue with States on the implementation of their obligations. As the Chairman has outlined in the work programme for the next 90 days, the first on-site visits to States are likely to take place soon. We strongly support those visits and encourage States to extend full cooperation to the visiting teams.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">Much has been said about the need to make it easier for countries to access the technical assistance they need to fulfil their obligations. My Government considers that a high priority. The CTED's role as facilitator of technical assistance is crucial and we are moving in the right direction, but the glass may not be even half full. We hope that a fully staffed CTED can ensure that needs are efficiently identified and prioritized. Also, it is essential to focus on matching those needs with potential donors and implementing agencies. We look forward to working with the CTC and the CTED in achieving that goal.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">Finally, I strongly believe that we will achieve those goals only if we succeed in duly involving international and regional organizations. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Chairman and the organizers of the CTC's fourth special meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations and bodies, which will take place later this month. Better cooperation is the key to ensuring efficient use of resources invested in countering the terrorist threat.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Denmark for her proposals.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zhang Yishan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">I should like to thank Ambassador Denisov, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for his briefing. For the past three months, under his leadership, the CTC has carried out effective work, which merits commendation by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">During the transitional period of CTC reform, the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED) has been active. Here, we should like to express our appreciation to Ambassador Rupérez, Director of the CTED.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">We welcome the CTC's fourteenth 90-day work programme. We hope that the CTED will become fully operational as soon as possible so that it can implement the various points agreed by the Council on revitalizing the CTC. In that connection, I should like to make three brief points.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">First, the CTC should assist in and promote the formulation of a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy. The CTC is one of the Council's most forceful mechanisms in the field of counter-terrorism; its authority and legitimacy are widely recognized by all sides. The CTC should continue to play a central role in that field, including -- in accordance with the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> -- by promoting best practices and formulating norms and regulations in the field of counter-terrorism so as to help Member States carry out their counter-terrorism obligations. We support an early commencement of work by the working group established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> so that it can play an important role in expanding the legal basis of, and common understanding in, the field of counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Secondly, the CTC should continue to strengthen and improve its counter-terrorism assistance efforts by assessing the assistance needs of Member States and by serving as a bridge between donor countries and recipient countries. It has played a beneficial role in that regard. It should further utilize its advantages and take practical measures to promote the integration of resources among donor countries, United Nations agencies and regional organizations so that counter-terrorism assistance can have a greater practical result. We hope that the CTC will carefully plan its first visits to Member States, making those visits an important way in which to strengthen its dialogue with Member States and to meet their assistance needs.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">Thirdly, we welcome the CTC's fourth special meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations, to be jointly hosted by the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Government of Kazakhstan. We hope that that meeting will further promote cooperation between the CTC and the relevant organizations in the counter-terrorism field. We also support continued strengthening of the coordination and communication among the CTC, the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> and the 1566 working group.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Thomson</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa01">I want to begin by putting on record the United Kingdom's appreciation not only for Ambassador Denisov's briefing, but also for the work done by him as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), and by paying tribute to the staff of the Russian delegation, who have worked hard to support the CTC during this period of transition. I would also like to thank Mr. Rupérez for the effort he has devoted to pursuing the earliest possible establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED).</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa02">I can associate my delegation with the remarks to be made in due course by the representative of Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union, so I will comment on only a few points, beginning briefly with the question of the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa03">From the United Kingdom's point of view, the delays in the CTED's establishment have been frustrating. Nevertheless, we are now on the threshold of the functioning of the new structure. We very much hope that it will be in place and fully operational by the time of the next of these open meetings. It is important that the CTED be staffed with experts who are able to bring with them a real understanding of the issues of counter-terrorism. The CTC has an ambitious agenda in dialogue with States, in dialogue with international, regional and subregional organizations and in dialogue with other parts of the United Nations. The CTC is also developing its role in technical assistance and taking on new responsibilities -- for instance, in compiling best practices. We are all going to need highly qualified and experienced experts to help us take that work forward.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa04">There are several important elements to the CTC's agenda in coming months. My delegation sees two key areas. The first is a welcome deepening of the CTC's relationship with States. I would like to use this meeting to encourage all States -- not least through their missions in New York -- to get to know the CTC and the staff of the CTED. The Committee, I know, is very keen to understand the particular circumstances and challenges of each country in developing its approach to counter-terrorism and in implementing its obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa05">In that context, the beginning of the CTC's programmed visits to States is extremely welcome to us. We look forward to those visits becoming a regular part of the CTC's work. They are a very direct way to help countries tackle terrorism, and they offer an unparalleled opportunity for the CTC itself to understand in depth the challenges on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa06">Another part of the CTC's outreach approach is its dialogue with international, regional and subregional organizations. Between them, those organizations have a more specialized and detailed knowledge of the challenge of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> than the CTC can ever have. We look forward to the CTC's meeting in Almaty next week and would like to thank the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Government of Kazakhstan for their role in making it possible.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa07">As current Chair of the Group of Eight, the United Kingdom would like to emphasize the commitment of that grouping, in particular its Counter-Terrorism Action Group, to working with the CTC and the CTED.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa08">Technical assistance will continue to be a second key area for the work of the CTC and the CTED. The developing direct relationship with States -- both donor and recipient States -- will, of course, be key to that, as will the relationship with organizations that can provide specialist advice. As Chair of the Group of Eight's Counter-Terrorism Action Group, the United Kingdom will also work to ensure that the Group continues to develop its role in supporting the Counter-Terrorism Committee. And we look forward to greater cooperation between those two bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa09">The United Kingdom will be working through the CTC to support a more proactive and targeted approach to assistance. We think it vital that in the work of the CTC we consider not only whether we are meeting our responsibilities to process reports but whether we are in fact meeting our greater responsibility to help States tackle terrorism nationally and internationally.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa10">It is worth noting at this point, however, that unless States engage with the CTC, it will be impossible for us on the Committee to be able to analyze accurately what States need. For that reason, as well as for many others, I should like to add my voice to those who have already called on States to meet the timetable for reporting and, if doing so poses difficulties, for them to get in touch with the Committee to start a conversation about how it can be done.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa11">Before I close, I would like to mention two areas of work that will be happening in parallel with the work of the CTC. First, Council members will be considering how best to make sure that the Council's counter-terrorism effort is as effective as it can be. By that I mean, among other things, how we can best use and coordinate the expertise that we have in the four Council subsidiary bodies that deal with the issue.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa12">The second area of work parallel to that of the CTC is the work that has already started, to consider the report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Some of the key proposals in that report address terrorism. One in particular is worth mentioning this morning: the recommendation for a comprehensive "pan-United Nations" strategy on terrorism. The United Kingdom fully supports that proposal. The Secretary-General has already said that he is acting on it, preparing a strategy that will bring together a range of tools and organizations across the United Nations system. I am sure that the CTC will be a key part of the United Nations approach. Nevertheless, the issue of how to make a real difference against terrorism goes further than the work or the competence of the CTC alone. The United Kingdom looks forward to engaging in that broader debate as well.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa13">The Council has a busy agenda on counter-terrorism in the coming year. The CTC is designed to play a central role in the international effort against terrorism. It is important, we think, for the Committee and the Council that we are seen to do so. 2005 should be an important year for the CTC, one in which we can use our new resources to have a real impact. The United Kingdom and my mission stand ready to play their parts in shouldering that responsibility, rolling up our sleeves and getting on with the substantive work ahead.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">It is useful, we believe, to recall for the Council the importance of the technical assistance that the Counter-Terrorism Committee can provide.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahiga</span> <span class="nation">Tanzania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">We wish first to acknowledge with thanks the welcome extended to my delegation by Ambassador Denisov, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). As a new member of the Security Council and the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the United Republic of Tanzania will do all that is within its capability to cooperate with others to help enable the CTC undertake its important mandate, established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">As one of a growing number of countries with first-hand experience of a major terrorist attack on its soil, Tanzania's resolve in the war against that scourge has never been stronger, while paying due regard to human rights principles. That was reaffirmed by Tanzania's President, Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, in his address to the General Assembly last September: "There should never be any doubt about our unflinching resolve to cooperate with others in combating terrorism in all its forms" (<i><a href="../html/A-59-PV.3.html">A/59/PV.3</a>, p. 20</i>).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Tanzania strongly believes that the war against terrorism would be best coordinated and most effectively fought through the United Nations. That is where the importance of the CTC, as established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, is evidently appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">We thank the Chairman of the CTC for his briefing on the work done in 2004. We would like to express our gratitude for the commendable work of the Committee in scrutinizing the reports submitted by Member States. However, as the briefing indicated, the crucial issue of the shortage of expert capacity should be promptly addressed. Hopefully, the full establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED), under its able Executive Director, Mr. Javier Rupérez, would resolve the problem.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">We note with interest that the CTC is still undertaking efforts to elaborate a new approach to facilitating the provision of technical assistance. Tanzania is looking forward to, and awaiting the outcome of, the efforts currently undertaken by the CTC and the experts of the CTED in that respect. We believe that such technical assistance could be of immense help and could significantly help developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, in preparing and submitting proper reports on time.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">In that respect, Tanzania also supports the conduct of visits by the CTC to Member States. The visits are a useful source for the exchange of information and experiences on the exact technical assistance requirements for fully implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and other relevant resolutions on terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">On a related subject, the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, under the direction of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban, will be visiting my country, the United Republic of Tanzania, on 26 and 27 January 2005. The Government is looking forward to welcoming the visiting Security Council Team, and is willing to discuss with it, on a first-hand basis, the requirements for our reporting obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1267 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">We would also like to thank Ambassador Denisov for the submission of a work programme for the CTC for the next three months -- January to March 2005. Going through the programme, one cannot fail to be impressed with the immense amount of work to be undertaken by the CTC in order to implement the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Tanzania would also like to commend the good preparations done by the CTC for the convening of the fourth special meeting with international, regional and sub-regional organizations, to be held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, from 26 to 28 January 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">Finally, we commend the efforts by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. In its report released recently, the Panel proposed a definition of terrorism -- a matter that has been eluding the General Assembly for almost 10 years and which has stalled the process of concluding a comprehensive convention on terrorism. The definition proposed in the report is similar to the language and elements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1566 (2004)</a>. We believe that that definition can be a useful guide to the General Assembly in helping to build consensus and agreement on this matter so as to enable the convention to be adopted as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Mahiga for reminding us of the importance attached to the issue of terrorism by the High-level Panel established by the Secretary-General.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baja</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I, too, would like to thank Ambassador Denisov, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for his comprehensive report on the activities of the Committee over the past three months, and its fourteenth 90-day work programme covering the period from the beginning of this month to the end of March this year.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">The scourge of terrorism remains one of the defining threats to international peace and security for the twenty-first century. In fact, in the synopsis of its report contained in <a href="../pdf/A-59-565.pdf" class="pdf">document A/59/565</a>, the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change cites terrorism as one of the "six clusters of threats with which the world must be concerned now and in the decades ahead".</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Given that scenario, the work of the CTC serves a central role in fulfilling Security Council's mandate -- the maintenance of international peace and security under the Charter. We note with satisfaction that there has been steady progress in the work and in the evolution of the CTC. This includes, first, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), which was established last June and which has been useful and functional with regard to the CTC, even though it has yet to become fully operational. Secondly, cooperation between international, regional and subregional organizations is flourishing and has produced notable results. Thirdly, coordination with other Council bodies dealing with terrorism continues to expand. And, fourthly and most importantly, interaction with Member States is advancing and deepening, mainly through country reports, which have served as the most important mode of dialogue between States and the CTC in the fight against the menace of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">The CTC has pursued its mandate vigorously under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1373 (2001)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1535 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1566 (2004)</a>, which most recently affirmed the unity and resolve of the Council in rooting out terrorism and its perpetrators. The working group established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>, which the Philippines is privileged to chair, will hold its first meeting and start its work before the end of the month.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">While the work of the CTC is progressing, there is still plenty of room for improvement. We hope to see the CTED activated early within the next 90-day period. As pointed out by Ambassador Denisov, the transition period before the CTED reaches full capacity is undercutting the productivity of the CTC in reviewing country reports and performing its other tasks. We encourage the process of hiring experts and personnel to be carried out in an expeditious manner so as to enable the CTED to reach high gear as early as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">On the matter of the composition of the Directorate, my delegation places strong emphasis on the hiring of competent individuals on the basis of the principle of gender equity and geographic balance. We believe that a representative pool of experts in the CTED will provide a greater measure of legitimacy and a solid source of intimate knowledge of all the areas of the world, which will benefit the work of counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">We are pleased to note that visits to States, with their consent, as envisaged under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, will be carried out within the next 90-day period. We also note that the CTC is preparing for the first of such visits and finalizing the framework within which such visits will be conducted. We have always considered that face-to-face interaction between the CTC and Member States is qualitatively better than letter-writing and the submission of country reports, and could be transformative in improving international cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Cooperation is enhanced by better understanding, and country visits by the CTC would contribute to greater understanding by Member States of what the Council is trying to achieve in the counter-terrorism field.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">Ambassador Denisov also raised the issue of the growing trend of the late submission of country reports. The problem has steadily worsened over time, and the CTC must begin seriously to consider remedial approaches to deal with the growing problem of tardy reports. If the matter is not resolved, at stake will be the effectiveness of the CTC in the short term and, in the longer term and more critically, the credibility of the Security Council. In a larger context however, the problem appears to be the exclusive domain of the CTC. But it is also plaguing the other Council Committees dealing with counter-terrorism and non-proliferation issues. Thus, it is critically important for all concerned Council bodies to ensure close coordination and cooperation in pursuing their respective mandates. They should seek synergistic approaches and methods that will help them to pursue their respective mandates and resolve common problems.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">We support the activities that are already undertaken, and to be undertaken, by the CTC to actively and effectively strengthen practical cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations in all areas related to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We know that, under the joint auspices of the CTC and the Commonwealth of Independent States, the fourth meeting with such organizations will be held later this month in Almaty, Kazakhstan. We hope that that meeting will further deepen contacts and cooperation between the CTC and those organizations for the purpose of obtaining the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Finally, in the fight against terrorism, we fully adhere to the idea that the Security Council, working through the CTC, must be guided by the principles of cooperation, transparency and the equal treatment of all States. The global effort against terrorism requires the Security Council and the rest of the membership of the United Nations to remain committed partners if success is to be achieved in eradicating that scourge. It is my hope that that will be our shared goal as we move ahead in this endeavour.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De La Sablière</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I would like at the outset to thank Ambassador Denisov, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for his report, and to say how much we appreciate his work as Chairman of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">I endorse the statement to be made by the representative of Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">Terrorism is one of the gravest threats to international peace and security, as the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change reiterated in its report to the Secretary-General. France is actively participating in the fight against that scourge and is working for effective United Nations action to that end, and in particular for effective action by the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). I wish in that regard to stress the following aspects of recent developments in the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate is now being set up, consistent with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, and will soon be fully operational, pursuant to the Council's request in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>. I should like to thank Mr. Rupérez once again for his resolute work to that end and to pay tribute to the States Members of the United Nations that have given the Executive Directorate the resources necessary to carry out its mission.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">Turning to the Committee's new programme of work, I should like to underscore a number of goals stressed therein, to which France attaches priority.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">First, as I have said in the past, France is gratified that the organization of visits to the field has been recognized as one of the Committee's new priorities, allowing it to become more operational and useful. The visits will enable us more accurately to assess how States are discharging their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. They will result in recommendations, including on technical assistance where necessary in order to help States to comply. The first visit will take place in the coming months, which is a very positive development.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">The programme of work also emphasizes strengthened cooperation between the CTC and the Al-Qaida sanctions Committee, as well as with the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>. We fully support that objective. I would add that cooperation between the CTC and the Working Group established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> offers further potential for strengthening United Nations counter-terrorism activities.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">France is also gratified that the CTC has begun to consider the increasingly worrisome phenomenon of States' delaying the submission of their reports to the Committee. Such tardy reports are evidence of the frequent difficulties involved in their compilation, which, if undertaken in earnest, can be quite onerous. However, the Council cannot accept that the obligations incumbent under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> are not fully met. We must therefore remedy the situation by identifying the type of assistance that States may require. The Global Programme against Terrorism of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) provides advisory services that can be useful in the preparation of reports. Above and beyond respect for the formal obligations involved in reporting, France hopes that the CTC will soon get to work assessing the requirements for technical assistance to States.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">Cooperation between the Committee and other United Nations bodies, as well as with international and regional organizations, is stressed most appropriately in the Committee's programme of work. Within the Organization, we believe, rapprochement and close cooperation with UNODC is of great importance. As to international organizations, France also hopes that the CTC will be able to work more effectively with the G-8's Counter-Terrorism Action Group, because we believe that the Group can provide meaningful support to the CTC's mission. As to regional organizations, the Committee is about to convene an important concertation and information exercise in Almaty. The programme of action and follow-up to be presented there enjoy our support, and we hope that the organizations invited to the meeting will fully endorse the document's orientations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">Over and above the work of the CTC under discussion today, everyone is mindful of the recommendations of the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. We await with great interest the global strategy to be prepared under the Secretary-General's guidance. We share the hope that an agreement will emerge on the definition of terrorism, thus strengthening the consensus that must underpin our activities. The September summit, we hope, can produce great progress on those issues, but we must get down to work forthwith and consider how we might give new momentum to United Nations counter-terrorism activities.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">France believes that the Working Group established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> could contribute to that ambitious exercise.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rostow</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Denisov for his briefing this morning and, indeed, his entire team for their leadership of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). These quarterly public Council meetings help ensure that counter-terrorism remains at the top of the Council's and the United Nations agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The Security Council and its counter-terrorism bodies are entering an important phase, and every effort should be made to ensure proper coordination. The Working Group established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> will start meeting later this month. The Group has an important mandate, which includes making recommendations to the Council on practical measures to be imposed on those involved in or associated with terrorist activities other than those on the Al-Qaida/Taliban sanctions Committee's consolidated list. In carrying it out, however, the Group should take special care to coordinate with existing Council counter-terrorism bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">In addition, the experts of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> will soon arrive in New York to begin their work of reviewing and analysing the reports submitted to that body. By early spring, we expect the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate to be fully staffed and ready to start visiting States to assess on-the-ground efforts to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We encourage States that need help to reach out to Ambassador Rupérez and his team and welcome them to visit their capitals.  With  those visits under way, the Counter-Terrorism Committee will be moving to its next phase and a step closer to being able to identify those States that are not meeting their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1566 (2004)</a> explicitly called on the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Al-Qaida/Taliban sanctions Committee and the 1540 Committee to enhance cooperation with each other. While we have seen some progress in that area, including the first-ever meeting among the Chairmen of those bodies, there needs to be more sharing of information and consultation to ensure the most effective Council contribution to the global fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">There are a number of concrete steps that can and should be taken in that area. First, there should be regular meetings among the experts assigned to support each of the Council's terrorism-related bodies. Secondly, the Chairman of each committee should regularly hold a joint meeting for the wider United Nations membership to report on its work and to allow Member States to ask questions. Thirdly, the work programmes, including the proposed travel, of the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Executive Directorate (CTED) and the Monitoring Team should be drawn up together. Finally, the Executive Directorate, the Monitoring Team and the experts of the 1540 Committee, once they begin their work, should share a common database of information.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Although there are three Committees, and now a Working Group, involved in the global counter-terrorism campaign, we must not forget that they are all Security Council bodies. Each is supervised by, and indeed part of, the same body. Indeed, they are the Security Council. In the coming weeks and months, improved coordination among the Council's counter-terrorism bodies will be essential to make the United Nations a more effective player in the international counter-terrorism effort.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">Allow me to highlight the importance of the CTC's fourth special meeting of international, regional and subregional organizations, which is to be held next week in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Such meetings offer representatives of those organizations an opportunity to discuss the challenges they are facing in developing and implementing their counter-terrorism programmes, share best practices and improve coordination between and among the different players in the growing counter-terrorism industry. Yet that gathering should be about more than talking and exchanging information; it should lead to action and results.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">In short, while the discussions in Almaty are important, the follow-up is equally, or even more, important. Too often we have seen meetings of that sort not lead to the follow-up action necessary to advance the international counter-terrorism agenda. For example, there are still too many regional and subregional organizations that have yet to adopt or implement counter-terrorism action plans. We still have not seen enough organizations develop and disseminate counter-terrorism best practices.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">Almaty will be the first special meeting of the CTC since the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate and the appointment of Ambassador Rupérez as its leader. We have every confidence that he will help the participating organizations to take the necessary practical follow-up steps to advance the multilateral counter-terrorism campaign.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Andrey Denisov, for his comprehensive presentation on the work of the Committee and on the work programme for the coming months. As a member of the bureau, I wish to associate myself with his words. May I also express my appreciation for the presence among us of Ambassador Rupérez, Executive Director of the CTC's Executive Directorate (CTED), as well as for his contribution to the work of the United Nations. In addition, I wish to stress the valuable work being carried out by the Secretariat in support of the Committee and its subcommittees.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Brazil's firm commitment to counter-terrorism and our repudiation of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, as a most serious threat to peace and security. As the use of indiscriminate violence against non-combatants violates the most fundamental values of the Charter of the United Nations, terrorism fully deserves the strongest collective repudiation. Unfortunately, as seen in the case of other forms of violence such as organized crime, it seems unlikely that terrorism will be completely eliminated. At the United Nations the question now mainly has to do with the establishment of clear, legitimate and acceptable limits to the use of violence. If effective international cooperation mechanisms are properly established, terrorism may be kept at very low levels.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">In order to reach such a desirable outcome, the United Nations should have the primary responsibility for fostering a coordinated, comprehensive and integrated response on the part of the international community against terrorism, as was recently noted by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Such a strategy should not be restricted to punitive measures, but, rather, also properly tackle the root causes of terrorism. It is well known that the dire situations usually linked to social, political and cultural oppression, as well as severe economic inequalities, often create an environment favourable to the development of extremism. Any acceptable strategy should fully take into account the need to observe the relevant provisions of international law and due process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">We trust that the CTED will become fully operational in the near future, as the Chairman of the CTC has mentioned. We also hope that it will be able to help with the broadening and enhancement of the dialogue of the Committee and its subcommittees with the Member States and other United Nations bodies and international, regional and subregional organizations -- and in particular with the High Commissioner for Human Rights. We welcome the convening of the special meeting of the CTC with such organizations to be held in Almaty next week. We also hope that the CTED will be in a position not only to facilitate the actual offering of technical assistance, but also to make sure that the cooperation provided to countries by third parties is fully satisfactory. We believe that the first joint visits by the CTC and other relevant organizations, which are scheduled to start in March 2005, will provide an opportunity to identify countries' needs, thereby allowing for the provision of more focused cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Brazil recalls that the future composition of CTED personnel needs to observe the requirement of technical competence, as well as to reflect the values and legal systems of United Nations regional groups. We believe that consensus can be built on the basis of those principles. In our view, the CTC and CTED are structures designed mainly to shelter States that are willing to cooperate but that, for various reasons, find themselves unable to do so. The CTC and, by extension, the CTED are not to be likened to sanctions committees.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">We believe that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> reflects compromise language that contains a clear and important political message. Properly speaking, however, it should not be construed as a conceptual definition of terrorism. Furthermore, as foreseen in the Charter, we believe that reaching an agreed definition of terrorism falls under the functions and powers of the General Assembly. We are not convinced that the Security Council should assume such treaty-making prerogatives. In the absence of such a definition, there may be a risk of issues before the Committee becoming unnecessarily politicized.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Finally, I wish to stress that Brazil welcomes current efforts to update and strengthen the efforts of the United Nations in the area of counter-terrorism and remains open to participating in the deliberations concerning this very serious issue. In that regard, Brazil expects that the global strategy to combat terrorism to be presented by the Secretary-General, as well as his recommendation on that issue, will help us to overcome existing difficulties.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Sardenberg for reminding us that the support of regional organizations is important in combating terrorism, and that fighting terrorism should take place in the context of full respect for human rights.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">I would like to join previous speakers in thanking Ambassador Denisov for his comprehensive presentation on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the challenges ahead. I take this opportunity to extend to him our appreciation for the impressive leadership he is displaying at the helm of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">As Romania aligns itself with the statement to be made later by the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union, I shall confine myself to only few brief comments of a complementary nature.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">For several years now, terrorism has topped the agenda of the Security Council. The very first speech I delivered before the Council last year, on 12 January, was terrorism-related. Furthermore, the starting point of Romania's contribution within the Council to fostering successive initiatives in the field of combating terrorism was its active involvement in the intricate process of negotiating <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, which was unanimously adopted on 30 January 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">It is therefore no coincidence, I believe, that United Nations Members are once again called, at the beginning of this new year, to learn about the activities of one of the most dynamic subsidiary bodies of the Council and to express their views on this topic.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">Countering the ominous scourge of global terrorism requires continuous review and reinforcement of the mechanisms at the disposal of the United Nations, as well as the consolidation of the institutional dimension of the efforts undertaken in that field at the United Nations level.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">Visits by the CTC to selected Member States, with their consent, is one of the most recent instruments with which the Committee has been provided in its endeavours to enhance dialogue with the relevant authorities of the respective countries. It is our belief that such visits will contribute significantly to strengthening the monitoring of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> while also giving important indications of States' needs for technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">Nevertheless, close coordination and cooperation are required between the CTC and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban in preparing such visits in order to avoid any possible overlap. Joint visits by the two Committees could be envisaged to achieve that goal. Since the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> has become fully operational, the participation of its representatives in such joint visits might also be contemplated.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">The significant number of States that are late in submitting their national reports to the CTC remains of particular concern. Non-reporting, regardless of motivation -- lack of willingness or lack of capacity on the part of the States concerned -- is a highly worrisome situation that must be addressed on a priority basis. Further measures should be therefore sought to boost the level of reporting by States Members of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">In carrying forward its leading role in the global fight against terrorism, the Security Council benefits from the work of three energetic subsidiary bodies, namely the CTC, the 1267 Committee and, lately, the 1540 Committee. The mandates and activities of those Committees are closely interlinked, as terrorist acts and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are two faces of the same coin. Cooperation among their Chairmen, as well as among their experts, is therefore essential to ensuring a coherent approach on the part of the Council in combating terrorism. The informal tripartite consultations mechanism which has already been established should be further consolidated and given new dimensions. The regular exchange of information as well as collaboration in analysing and responding to reports submitted by Member States could bring added value to such efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa10">Such interactions will not be complete if they do not encompass the undertakings expected from the working group established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>. I take this opportunity to welcome Ambassador Baja of the Philippines to the chairmanship of that working group and to assure him of our full cooperation, as expressed in the context of the explanations of vote made after the voting on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> by most of the members of the Council. We trust that, under the able leadership of the Permanent Representative of the Philippines, the working group will become an important source of valuable recommendations for the work of the Security Council in the field of combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa11">In the same vein, it is crucially important that the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED), under the notable guidance of Ambassador Javier Rupérez, enter swiftly into full operational mode and that it receive all necessary support from the entire system, on a clear priority basis -- as should be the case for all structures established by the Council to effectively counter the dual proliferation of terrorist acts and of weapons of mass destruction, respectively.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa12">I believe that, as the United Nations membership moves to examine the recommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, it is a good opportunity for our delegation to register its support for the general strategy on combating terrorism United Nations-wide that is proposed and supported by the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa13">Finally, I would like to express our gratitude to the Commonwealth of Independent States and to the Government of Kazakhstan for the efforts made in organizing the fourth special meeting of the CTC with international, regional and subregional organizations, to be held next week in Almaty. We fully support furthering the practice of holding such meetings, as they are aimed at increasing the cohesiveness of the global response to the dreadful threat posed by international terrorism, while drawing upon the results of the important strides made at the regional and subregional levels in this fight.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I think that all the members of the Council share the views of the representative of Romania as to the importance of cooperation between the CTC and the 1540 Committee, which he is so ably chairing.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adechi</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">Let me thank Ambassador Denisov for briefing the Council on the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). I should like also to take this opportunity to commend the Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED), Ambassador Rupérez, for his effective work and his firm dedication to the mission that has been entrusted to him.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">No country can feel safe from the threat of terrorism, and no country alone can feel strong enough to deal with it. We therefore need to continue to pool our efforts and to strengthen international cooperation, which remains the best means to counter terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">The CTC and its Executive Directorate therefore need to continue resolutely their efforts on the ground by strengthening a constructive dialogue with States in order to provide them with the necessary assistance and to ensure that the legal, institutional and operational conditions are in place to monitor the movement of funds, trans-border activities on the part of terrorist groups or individuals, and the circulation of weapons and other chemical products.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">In that respect, the framework document for on-site assessments remains a valuable tool that must be finalized as soon as possible to serve as a context for CTC visits on the ground. My delegation believes that visits to Member States are of great importance, as they make it possible to determine the level of implementation by States of their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>; assess their capacities to meet their obligations; and, in particular, to identify the measures that must be taken to help States to strengthen their protection, in particular in the area of technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">The ultimate goal in this respect is to help States to protect their peoples from threats and to contribute to protecting the peoples of other States. From that standpoint, the CTC must work proactively to increase the productivity and effectiveness of its actions in the area of the provision of assistance. That is all the more necessary because the effectiveness of measures to combat terrorism depends on their full implementation by all States members of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">Furthermore, the States that have not yet done so should consider becoming parties to the various conventions and protocols related to terrorism. They need to take the appropriate legislative measures that will enable them to honour their international counter-terrorism commitments. Here, the submission of periodic reports is an equally important aspect. States must strive to ensure that the measures they take in the context of fighting terrorism are in full accordance with human rights and international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">But, beyond all those activities, the international community must address social inequalities and injustice -- in short, underdevelopment -- and conflict, because these indicate dysfunctionality in the system that can generate violence and extremism. In particular, we must undertake further efforts to prevent the collapse of vulnerable States. Failed States -- or States under stress, as we tend to call them today -- are ideal safe havens for terrorist networks. In fact, the international community must place greater priority on promoting mutual respect and understanding among peoples to make our world more friendly and united. In that way, we can deprive terrorism of its breeding ground and eliminate this scourge in order to strengthen international peace and security.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Benmehidi</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I, too, should like to thank Ambassador Denisov for his excellent presentation of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and for his efforts as Committee Chairman. I should also like to take this opportunity to express my delegation's appreciation to the delegations of Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain, which have left the Council and which, during their mandate, showed great commitment and spared no effort to carry out the CTC's mandate. In addition, I should like to welcome the CTC's new members. Finally, I cannot fail to welcome the presence of Ambassador Rupérez, Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED), and to thank him and his team for their efforts and their contribution to the implementation of the CTC's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The number of reports submitted by Member States under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is significant. The CTC is preparing to receive the fifth series of reports, and we hope that the necessary resources, including human resources, will be made available to it so that it can carry out its mandate. We note, however, that 75 Member States have not fulfilled their obligations by submitting their reports on time. That is a source of concern for my delegation, since most of those States are developing countries, particularly African countries. We note the willingness shown by the Committee, through the efforts of its Executive Directorate, to provide them with the assistance and advice needed for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We hope that a proactive approach is taken to engage in direct dialogue with those countries, including by raising the awareness of regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">It goes without saying that implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is not limited to reviewing reports, but also requires additional and tools resources. That is why we welcome the fact that the CTC has already begun an analytical effort to assess States' assistance needs, which will be integrated into the report review process.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">In the past, my delegation has called on the Committee to organize visits to selected States as a means of direct dialogue with them to strengthen the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and to assess technical assistance needs to ensure such implementation. The CTC has already adopted general guidelines and procedures for the preparation, carrying out and assessment of such visits. These are tools that will enable it to better perform its tasks under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1566 (2004)</a>. We are pleased that, beginning in March, the CTC has scheduled a number of visits to States in various regions. That effort, which forms part of the implementation of the goal of revitalizing the CTC, deserves to be encouraged and reaffirmed.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">Furthermore, we welcome the fact that the CTC will hold its fourth special meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations in Almaty, Kazakhstan, from 26 to 28 January 2005. In that regard, we appreciate the offer by the Commonwealth of Independent States and the efforts of the Kazakh Government to prepare that meeting, which seek to develop the relations between the CTC and international and regional organizations and hence to strengthen global counter-terrorism efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">We note with satisfaction the informal contacts between the Chairmen of the CTC, the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>. In that connection, we believe that the coordination of the schedule of visits deserves particular attention. Moreover, we would like to see greater interaction among those bodies and between the CTC and the various United Nations structures involved in the fight against terrorism. We approve the fourteenth work programme for the next trimester and the goals set out therein. Now that the budgetary and administrative provisions have been finalized, we are confident that the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate will become fully operational.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">Finally, Algeria, which is firmly committed to the fight against terrorism and which voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>, believes that that resolution's main objective was to reaffirm the mobilization of the international community in fighting against that scourge and not to provide a definition of terrorism, which is the sole prerogative of the General Assembly, the Organization's legislative and deliberative body, which, we hope, will be able to arrive at a consensus definition of the phenomenon of terrorism as soon as possible.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vassilakis</span> <span class="nation">Greece</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">At the outset, we thank Ambassador Denisov, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for his detailed and substantive briefing concerning the activities of the CTC for the past three months and its future work programme for the first trimester of 2005. We also like to congratulate him on his able leadership of the CTC. Our thanks go also to Ambassador Rupérez and his team for their work in the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED). Greece, as a new member of the CTC, is determined to actively participate in its work and to establish close and constructive cooperation with the Chairman and the other members of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">Greece fully associates itself with the statement to be made later in the debate by the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union. I would like, however, to add the following points.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Greece fully supports the open debates of the Council on the activities of the CTC. We are convinced that they contribute to further transparency and better understanding of the Committee's role in the global fight against terrorism and they increase its universal legitimacy. In our view, the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is intrinsically linked to public perception concerning the credibility and legitimacy of the work carried out by the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">By ensuring that all States have taken effective steps aimed at fully implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, enhancing their counter-terrorism capacity and promoting universal adherence to anti-terrorism conventions, the CTC has proved that terrorism is a universal challenge and that the fight against it requires both internal and global action. Greece is firmly committed to the full implementation of that resolution and other counter-terrorism resolutions, including, most recently, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">However, we firmly believe that counter-terrorism activities must at all times be in conformity with respect for the United Nations Charter and international law, including international human rights law and refugee and humanitarian law. In that respect, we welcome the recommendations of the report of the High-level Panel on Treats, Challenges and Change concerning terrorism and, in particular, those relating to the need for all Member States to ratify and thoroughly implement the 12 United Nations anti-terrorism conventions and protocols, to achieve a consensus definition on terrorism within the General Assembly, to rapidly complete negotiations on a comprehensive convention on terrorism, to promote a comprehensive United Nations strategy to fight terrorism and to institute a process for reviewing cases of individuals and institutions claiming to have been wrongly placed or retained on the watch lists of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">We are encouraged by the Security Council's continued efforts to make the CTC more efficient, competent and pertinent to global action against terrorism, and to accelerate the revitalization process, particularly by making the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate fully operational.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">In our view, the provision of technical assistance to States is a key element for the effective implementation of the resolution. In this regard, we welcome the initiative of the Committee to start assessing the assistance needs of Member States and -- if the State concerned agrees -- to share such assessments with interested donor States and organizations. In this connection, we think that the updated Assistance Matrix is an important tool for interested States to identify and obtain technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">Following <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>, we support the development of a set of best practices, in consultation with relevant international, regional and subregional organizations and United Nations bodies, to assist States in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">Concerning the main tasks of the Committee over the next three months, Greece welcomes the decision of the Committee to undertake its first visit to a United Nations Member State. Such visits, carried out with the consent of States, could be useful in terms of establishing a better dialogue with such States and of providing a more accurate picture of the situation on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">Finally, we welcome the forthcoming fourth special meeting of the CTC with international, regional and subregional organizations, to be held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Government of Kazakhstan. Such meetings enhance the current level of cooperation with international organizations, contribute to avoiding duplication of activities and increase the effectiveness of resource utilization.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Vassilakis for his interesting comments.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Oshima</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank Ambassador Denisov for his presentation today on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and for the commendable work that has been done by the CTC under his leadership. Japan has been participating in the work of the CTC as an interested State. Now, as a member of the CTC as from this month, we will be able to engage more actively in the work of the CTC and enhance our cooperation in order to help the Committee to meet the expectations of the international community by upgrading the counter-terrorism efforts of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">My Government supports the programme of work for the first quarter of this year, as outlined by Ambassador Denisov. I would like to make three brief points regarding the work programme, on which we believe the CTC should be focusing particular attention as we move forward.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">First, Japan expects the fourth special meeting of the CTC with international, regional and subregional organizations, to be held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, at the end of the month, to be important in developing closer links between the CTC and those organizations. In this regard, Japan, and my mission here, would like to thank the Government of Kazakhstan for offering to host that important meeting. Japan will participate in the meeting, including by sending staff from the New York mission. I wish to stress that, in order for the CTC to be able to facilitate full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and other relevant Security Council resolutions, enhanced dialogue and cooperation with the many counter-terrorism-related organizations at the international, regional and subregional levels is critically important.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">It will also be necessary to avoid duplication of effort, as well as to close gaps in the work done by such organizations covering a variety of counter-terrorism activities. In this connection, we hope that establishing best practices by the CTC in relation to dealing with the financing of terrorism, as requested in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1566 (2004)</a> and mentioned in the most recent programme of work, will be facilitated through the process of consultation with relevant organizations, some of which will be participating in the forthcoming special meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">My Government considers it appropriate that the CTC should begin developing best practices, in the first instance on measures related to the financing of terrorism in the first instance. But it should then be able to gradually extend its work on best practices to other areas of counter-terrorism policy.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">My second point has to do with the importance of the CTC's visits to States, as called for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1566 (2004)</a>. While we welcome the visits programme, we realize that there will be a limit to the number of States that the CTC and the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED) will be able to manage to visit. That being the case, the visits by the CTC and the CTED should not only concentrate on the States visited, but should also inform and bring benefits to other States not visited through the sharing of information and experience gained, which may be useful in assisting those other States in their efforts to enhance their counter-terrorism capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">In the same vein, we would expect that, upon completion of a foreign visit, the CTC would share to the extent possible, its findings, views and information on States' needs assessments with interested Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">Thirdly, my Government has high expectations of the analytical work that will be done by the CTED when it becomes fully operational during the first quarter of this year. We hope that the new team of CTED experts will eventually be able to submit to the CTC a report in which it will present its comprehensive analyses and views and, where appropriate, make recommendations regarding technical assistance requirements of Member States. It should present its views regarding the regions and countries with respect to which the CTC should be intensifying its efforts, benefiting from consultations with experts from other relevant organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">The international community has suffered untold tragedy and misery as a result of an ever-increasing number of acts of terror. The CTC must ensure that the sacrifices made by the victims of terrorism, however tragic, are not in vain. It carries a heavy responsibility in that regard, and the international community expects it to continue its work with unflinching determination in pursuit of the best practically attainable measures aimed at preventing and working towards the elimination of the scourge of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">To that end, we expect that the CTC will continue to cooperate fully with other committees related to terrorism, such as the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee and the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa11">Finally, let me express my appreciation to Ambassador Denisov for his unfailing strong leadership and to the experts and secretariat members of the CTC, as well as to Ambassador Rupérez and the Directorate staff, for their commendable efforts. My Government pledges its continued full support for the work done in this important Committee.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">We are grateful to Ambassador Oshima for urging the international community not to abandon the fight against terrorism and to support the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">I shall now make a statement in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">I would like to thank Ambassador Andrey Denisov, Chairman of the CTC, and Ambassador Javier Rupérez, Executive Director of the Executive Directorate of the Committee, for their work.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">Briefly, I should like to say that combating terrorism has become one of the main priorities of the United Nations, as has been demonstrated in recent years. Argentina shares the international community's concern on the need to advance towards an effective response to the scourge of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">The reports that have been circulated to the Council set out the important progress achieved in recent months and prospects for the coming quarter. We should like briefly to note Argentina's hopes for the coming months.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">First, the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) should deepen its dialogue with the Member States in order to solve, inter alia, the problems connected to delays and inefficiencies in the submission of reports. With the help of the Executive Directorate, we should analyse various ways to streamline cooperation by offering advice to States that require it in order to make it easier for them to comply with the Council's resolutions and, in particular, to submit their reports in a timely manner. We believe that the first visit to a Member State, to be carried out in March, will undoubtedly set an important precedent in the cooperation of and assistance to Member States, helping them better to assess the assistance that the United Nations may provide. Argentina will participate actively in the CTC's adoption of the guiding document for visits to States.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">Secondly, it is essential that we develop the best possible level of cooperation between the CTC and the various international, regional and subregional organizations, as has already been noted. That is why we wish to point out the importance of the fourth special meeting of the CTC in Almaty next week. We are especially grateful to Kazakhstan and to the Commonwealth of Independent States for organizing that meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">We should also like to prioritize cooperation within the United Nations system, be it between the CTC and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) or, more particularly, between the CTC, the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> and the Al-Qaida/Taliban sanctions Committee, which I chair on behalf of Argentina. A good example of such cooperation was the seminar held in Asuncion, Paraguay, in December 2004. The seminar on drafting counter-terrorism legislation, organized jointly by the Government of Paraguay and the United Nations, was attended by the CTC, UNODC and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The outcome was held to be most satisfactory, and we commend the organizers.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">We also hope that the CTC's work will be more effective once the Executive Directorate becomes fully operational. The cooperation and assessment tasks entrusted to the Executive Directorate will undoubtedly be of vital importance to the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">Finally, we wish to add that United Nations counter-terrorism activities must be effective and serve as an example to the entire international community. To be effective, they must be seen by civil society to be impartial, transparent and respectful of the principles of the Charter, international law and, most especially, human rights. I reaffirm the resolute commitment of my Government, as a member of the Security Council and Chairman of the Al-Qaida/Taliban sanctions Committee, to the struggle.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">I now call on the representative of Luxembourg to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bichler</span> <span class="nation">Luxembourg</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania; the candidate countries Turkey and Croatia; the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Serbia and Montenegro; and the European Free Trade Association country Norway, member of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">First of all, I wish on behalf of the European Union to express my appreciation to Ambassador Denisov, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for his comprehensive briefing on the activities carried out by the Committee during the past three months and on the programme of work for the next 90 days, which the EU fully supports.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">The European Union very much looks forward to pursuing its good cooperation with the standing and new members of the CTC. I would also like to thank Mr. Rupérez for his valuable work since assuming the leadership of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED). The European Union is looking forward to the CTED's becoming fully operational during the current 90-day period.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">The European Union continues to attach great importance to the open debates of the Security Council on the issue of counter-terrorism, and in particular on the work of the Committee. They contribute to strengthening the general acceptance and legitimacy of the CTC among all the members of the United Nations family.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">While the European Union actively supports your call, Sir, on all States that have not submitted their reports on time to do so as soon as possible, we would like to focus today on three aspects which the European Union believes deserve particular attention.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">First is the development of a comprehensive strategy to fight terrorism. At its summit meeting in Brussels in December 2004, the European Union reiterated its determination to combat the continued threat of terrorism through a comprehensive and integrated approach, reinforcing both internal and international cooperation, in accordance with the principles on which the Union is founded.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">The European Union also reiterated its conviction that, in order to be effective in the long run, the Union's response to terrorism must address the root causes of terrorism. As radicalization and recruitment can be closely connected, the European Union has decided to establish by June 2005 a long-term strategy and action plan on both issues.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">In that context, the European Union welcomes the recommendations concerning counter-terrorism put forward in the report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change with regard to the major role the United Nations should take in developing a comprehensive strategy to fight terrorism. Those include the urgent need to complete negotiations on a comprehensive convention on terrorism, the particular importance of reaching a consensus on a legal definition of terrorism as soon as possible, the urgency of achieving universal ratification and comprehensive implementation of all international counter-terrorism conventions and protocols, the need to facilitate assistance to those who need it in order to increase their capacity to prevent terrorism, and lastly, closer coordination with all United Nations bodies and all other actors in the global counter-terrorism effort.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">Through its counter-terrorism coordinator, Mr. Gijs de Vries, the European Union is currently working to promote greater coordination between the various counter-terrorism initiatives, policies and activities of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">The second aspect I would like to raise today is related to respect for due process. The European Union is convinced that terrorism must be fought in the context of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Counter-terrorism efforts must never take place in the absence of respect for due process and the rule of law. There can be no trade-off between human rights and effective security measures. Indeed, respect for human rights must remain an integral part of any global counter-terrorism strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">In that regard, the European Union welcomes the fact that a human rights expert will be one of the main advisers of the Executive Director. We expect that expert to increase the profile of human rights and the rule of law within the Executive Directorate and in its contacts with other United Nations bodies dealing with human rights, as well as in its outreach to Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa12">In the same context, the European Union also welcomes the recommendation of the High-level Panel to institute a process for reviewing the cases of those claiming to have been wrongly placed or retained on the watch-list of the Al-Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee. Such a process could also benefit the work of other sanctions committees.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa13">My third point pertains to the more dynamic role to be played by the CTC in its relations with the outside world. The European Union welcomes the fact that the CTC and the Executive Directorate will enhance and broaden their dialogue with Member States and international, regional and subregional organizations. We welcome the fact that the first visit by the CTC to Member States is now scheduled for March 2005. We also welcome the upcoming fourth special meeting of the CTC with international, regional and subregional organizations, which is to be held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States. The European Union will participate actively in that very important meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa14">In addition, direct dialogue will facilitate the development of a set of best practices, in consultation with the relevant bodies of the United Nations -- in particular with the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and other international, regional and subregional organizations -- and the provision of technical assistance. It will also make it possible to better tailor those practices to the real needs of Member States. For its part, the European Union is actively pursuing its relations with third countries, in particular through visits and direct dialogue, including the possibility of providing technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa15">In conclusion, allow me to congratulate the Chairman of the CTC for the work he has done in very clearly identifying the priorities for the three months ahead. I would also like to reassure you, Mr. President, that the European Union remains firmly committed to the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, as well as all other Council resolutions related to counter-terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">In accordance with rule 37, I now call on the representative of Kazakhstan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kazykhanov</span> <span class="nation">Kazakhstan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for organizing this debate, which provides an opportunity to review the progress made in the fight against terrorism and to identify priorities for the Counter-Terrorism Committee's (CTC) activities in the future. My delegation would like to pay tribute to Ambassador Andrey Denisov for his effective and inspiring stewardship of the activities of the CTC, as well as to thank him for his presentation of the CTC's work programme for the next 90-day period and his briefing on the Committee's work during the last three months. I would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the Executive Director of the Committee's Executive Directorate (CTED), Ambassador Javier Rupérez, for his commendable efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">My delegation has a positive assessment of the CTC's work during the reporting period. It is encouraging to note that, despite the existing difficulties in getting the Executive Directorate up and running, the Committee has been able to make considerable progress in the revitalization of its activities. We note with great satisfaction that the Committee is finalizing preparations to begin its visits to several Member States, in compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1535 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1566 (2004)</a>, the first of which is planned for March 2005. Such visits represent a qualitatively new and practical instrument designed to develop cooperation and dialogue with Member States and to provide much-needed technical and expert assistance in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">A new element in the Committee's work has been the analytical work to assess the requirements of Member States in the context of preparing their reports on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and to develop an integrated assistance matrix. The Committee's record during the reporting period indicates that it is actively applying new approaches to the coordination of technical cooperation with States, closely linking that mission with efforts to reinforce interaction with international and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">As indicated in the report by the Chairman of the CTC, that Committee, in cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States, will hold its fourth special meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations in Almaty, Kazakhstan. On behalf of my Government, I would like to express our deep gratitude to the Security Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee for the high honour and privilege of hosting such a significant event.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">We consider it very important that the CTC meeting will be convened jointly with the Commonwealth of Independent States, in the heart of the Eurasian continent. Counter-terrorism activities in our region are closely linked with efforts to prevent the trafficking of drugs, arms and human beings. Most of the region's organizations pay special attention to the development of cooperation in counter-terrorism activities. In particular, in addition to carrying out other meaningful activities, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization have set up, and quite successfully operated, specialized antiterrorist centres. We believe that the experience we have acquired in the process might prove useful to the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that Kazakhstan has been cooperating fully with the CTC since its inception and intends to provide to that important body all the necessary assistance, exerting every effort to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa01">We thank the Government of Kazakhstan for having organized the fourth meeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, to be held in Almaty.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Buffa</span> <span class="nation">Paraguay</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa01">Allow me at the outset, on behalf of the delegation of Paraguay, to thank Ambassador Andrey Denisov, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for his briefing and to congratulate him on the work he has been doing under the mandate entrusted to him by the Council on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations. I should like also to congratulate Ambassador Javier Rupérez for his work as Executive Director of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa02">The Government of Paraguay has consistently condemned energetically terrorism in all its aspects, which it considers to be a scourge affecting all humanity. We therefore believe that, in order to fight terrorism, it is imperative that the international community act in a coordinated and committed manner.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa03">My Government reiterates once again its resolute support for the work that the Security Council is carrying out, in cooperation with Member States, in the context of the global combat against terrorism. My country, in keeping with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, has ratified and acceded to the 12 international conventions in the field of terrorism. Those instruments have now been incorporated into our national legislation, in keeping with constitutional provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa04">Ambassador Denisov also mentioned the high-level seminar to follow up on the recommendations of the resolution, whose goal was to analyse national legislation and regulations on terrorism and bring them into conformity with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The seminar was held last December at the request of the Government of the Republic of Paraguay in Asunción, Paraguay, in cooperation with the CTC; the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna; the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; and the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism of the Organization of American States (OAS). It was a pivotal event in helping to bring domestic legislation into conformity with international agreements, leading to an agreed body of legislation that complements and updates, in keeping with international standards, the available tools for combating terrorism. Meetings were also held with representatives of the three branches of the State -- Executive, Legislative and Judicial.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa05">The National Congress went into recess on 20 December and will resume its meetings on 1 March, and we expect the Executive branch to submit the draft law to the Congress at that time.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa06">We must stress that the presence at that seminar of an expert from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights was very important in terms of clarifying that all relevant legislation must be consistent with humanitarian law, thus dispelling any doubts that might arise in that connection. We wish also to highlight the presence of an expert from the OAS Inter-American Committee against Terrorism, thereby fulfilling the role assigned to regional organizations under the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa07">Allow me, on behalf of the Government of Paraguay, to voice our gratitude to the Chairman of the CTC, Ambassador Denisov; to the CTC Executive Directorate; to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna; and to the OAS Inter-American Committee against Terrorism for their outstanding cooperation in the holding of the seminar. I wish also to say before this important body that the Republic of Paraguay is fully compliant in terms of bringing its legislation into conformity with existing norms in the area of the combat against terrorism; that it responds to CTC reports in a timely fashion and in the proper format; and that in our country there is a national commitment on the part of the three branches of Government to continue to fight this battle.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa08">I should like also to point out that, at the subregional level, Paraguay, along with Argentina, Brazil and the United States of America, belongs to the Three Plus One group, whose principal goal is cooperation and the elaboration of mechanisms to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa09">The Government of Paraguay will continue to stress this issue in the Sixth Committee, so that, as requested in the report of the High-level Panel, we can reach a definition of terrorism, which has been discussed for almost a decade now, and so that we can finalize the draft conprehensive convention on international terrorism, thereby finally providing the international community with a unified legal framework to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa10">We hope that the first visit of the CTC to a member State in March 2005 will represent a practical step towards making progress in the task of cooperation with, and lending technical assistance to, Member States in their efforts to prevent and combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa11">Finally, we wish every success to the CTC's fourth meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations, to be held in Almaty Kazakhstan at the end of the month.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">We would like to convey to the Government of Paraguay our congratulations on the success of the seminar held in December in Asunción.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">I call on the representative of Liechtenstein.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wenaweser</span> <span class="nation">Liechtenstein</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">We welcome this opportunity to address in particular the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) as well as the overall United Nations response to terrorism in general, also in the light of the recent publication of the report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">The year ahead offers a number of opportunities for the United Nations to step up its efforts and efficiency in the fight against terrorism. The High-level Panel has identified terrorism as one of six categories of threats with which the world must be concerned in the years ahead. Liechtenstein has consistently joined the international community in strongly condemning all acts of terrorism, irrespective of their motivation and wherever and by whomever committed. We concur with the Panel's finding that it is imperative to develop a global strategy for fighting terrorism that addresses root causes and strengthens responsible States and the rule of law as well as fundamental human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">The most important and complex aspect of such a strategy concerns efforts to reverse the causes or facilitators of terrorism. Pointing to causes or facilitators is sometimes perceived as an attempt to justify terrorist acts, contrary to the unjustifiable nature of all forms and manifestations of terrorism, and is thus neglected in the international community's overall response. However, we must fight all aspects of terrorism with resolve, including in particular its root causes. These phenomena, ranging from major political grievances to failed States and poverty, often constitute threats to our common security in and of themselves. We hope that the process leading to the United Nations summit in 2005 will bring about strong new measures aimed at combating those phenomena and thereby contribute to the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">Countering extremism and intolerance is another important pillar of such a strategy, as is the development of better instruments for State cooperation in counter-terrorism. In the latter area, much work lies ahead, going far beyond the processes already in place, such as the negotiation of a comprehensive international convention against terrorism. Practical cooperation between States in the areas of law enforcement and intelligence sharing and relevant assistance and capacity-building need to be improved. The CTC's Executive Directorate (CTED) should continue to play -- and further strengthen -- its leading role in the coordination of such assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">We have repeatedly stressed the importance of respecting the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism. We therefore commend the High-level Panel for placing strong emphasis on that important aspect. The work of the Security Council in this area leaves room for improvement. Instituting a process for reviewing cases of individuals and institutions claiming to have been wrongly placed or retained on the list of the Al Qaeda/Taliban Sanctions Committee would be one important step in that direction. Furthermore, we are confident that the experts of the CTC's Executive Directorate will carry out their tasks with sensitivity for human rights concerns, and we commend Executive Director Rupérez for the envisaged inclusion of a human rights expert on his team. The forthcoming CTC visits to States, starting in March this year, will provide a good opportunity to put into practice the principle of an integrated approach of the rule of law and effective counter-terrorism measures.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">Major advances in the United Nations fight against terrorism are expected not only in the context of the follow-up to the report of the High-level Panel and the work of the strengthened CTC and CTED, but also in the context of the consultations of the working group established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>. Although we previously expressed concern about the mandate of the working group -- in particular with respect to due-process standards -- we are confident that it will work in an inclusive and transparent manner and will respect all standards relevant to the rule of law and human rights. That will effectively strengthen the credibility and thus the efficiency of any new measures to be adopted.</p>

	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">Once again, I would like to welcome the presence of Ambassador Andrey Denisov, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, and of Mr. Javier Rupérez, Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the briefing by the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) on the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa05">"The Security Council recalls the statement by its President on 19 October 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-37.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/37</a>), which indicated the Council's intention to review the structure and activities of the CTC; <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a> on the revitalization of the Committee; and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> emphasizing the urgent need to strengthen international cooperation in combating terrorism.</p>

It invites the CTC in particular to ensure that the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate becomes fully operational in the shortest possible time, and to take additional measures to enhance cooperation with the Al Qaeda/Taliban Sanctions Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, and to initiate contacts with the working group established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa07">"The Security Council notes the importance of continuing the CTC's efforts in the following key areas: to enhance the capabilities of Member States to combat terrorism; to identify and address the problems faced by States in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>; to facilitate the provision of technical assistance and cooperation adjusted to the recipient countries' needs; to encourage the largest possible number of States to become parties to the international conventions and protocols related to counter-terrorism; and to strengthen its dialogue and cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations acting in the areas outlined by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
