</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">It is now six months since the establishment of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism (CTC) and the Council agreed that it would review the structure and activities of the Committee at this point.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I shall not go into detail about the CTC's achievements so far because that information is already well known to Council delegations and to the wider United Nations membership through my regular briefings, but let me briefly set out the latest statistics. We have received 143 reports from Member States and others. We have reviewed and responded to 62 States and we are working hard to finish by the end of May the review of the remainder of reports received. We are following up with the 50 States that have not yet submitted reports.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">This is a significant achievement and I should like to thank the Vice-Chairmen of the Committee for leading the work in the subcommittees so intensively and thoroughly. I should also like to thank the Secretariat for the excellent support it has given to the CTC and its sub-committees and I pay tribute to our team of experts, sitting behind us, who have so ably risen to the challenge set by the Counter-Terrorism Committee. All of them -- all of us -- are developing a deeper expertise as we move forward.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Delegations are familiar with the work programmes that we issued for the first and second 90-day periods. Council members will find before them the work programme for the next, third, 90-day period in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-318.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/318</a>, but let me outline in a little more detail how the CTC sees its work developing in the next phase.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The Committee is unanimous in the view that it should continue to perform properly and thoroughly on the basis of transparency and even-handedness the tasks set for it by the Council, so that the capacity of all Member States to deal effectively with terrorism in their jurisdiction should be genuinely enhanced. In the course of monitoring the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in all States, the CTC will check the facts of the legislative picture, the administrative action taken and the way in which these tools are being used to prevent the territory of each State being abused by terrorists. We will continue the excellent dialogue which we have begun with all Members of the United Nations until the Committee is confident that each State has taken action on all the issues covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">Reaching that point of confidence does not equate to the CTC's declaring any Member State 100 per cent compliant. We do not believe that the Committee can sign off with any State. Against a constantly evolving background, there may always be further work to do to meet the objectives of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>, so the CTC will preserve the potential for dialogue with all States, although this will vary in intensity according to the capacity developed by the State concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">During the coming 90-day period, the CTC will complete its preliminary review of the reports it has received and, from 7 June, it will embark on its second review as the second round of reports begins to arrive. We intend to be more direct in the second phase in identifying potential gaps and in asking States what action they intend to take to address the issues of concern. The Committee will also need to be professional with States that require assistance. The CTC expects the experts to recommend what assistance might be needed and where the State might go to find the help it needs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">As we go forward under the terms of our mandate, the CTC will remain aware of the interaction of its work with human rights concerns, inter alia, through the contact the CTC has developed with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">There is also an agreement in principle around this table, reflected in our informal discussion on 2 April, that the CTC and the Council will, if necessary, consider what action is needed to address failures to meet the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> where these affect the comprehensive implementation of that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">I should like to encourage the 50 countries that have not yet submitted a report to get in touch with the Committee. We understand that putting together a full report may be difficult for countries that have little experience of dealing with terrorism or for which the preparation of such a report is a significant strain on their government machinery. But it is extremely important that all States be in dialogue with the CTC and we believe that this is the best way in which we can help States to find the assistance they might need to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Whatever the difficulty, it is essential that all States should have begun their written exchange with the Committee before 31 May 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">The Committee intends, in the process of reviewing the reports, to identify issues of cross-cutting concern where the professional work of other bodies interconnects with the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We intend to continue to make contact with other international organizations with a view to encouraging them to take action on issues that fall within their area of expertise. As an example, we have a close interest in the Financial Action Task Force's work on the funding of terrorist networks. There may also be a need for the International Civil Aviation Organization to look with fresh eyes at aviation security or for the International Maritime Organization to consider how the issuance of travel documents could be improved to prevent abuse by terrorists. As we proceed, we may have to contract in specialist expertise in these areas.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">The CTC further intends to deepen its contacts with regional organizations. It is in the interests of all States that their neighbours have proper safeguards in place to deal with terrorism and regional organizations have a key role to play in ensuring that action is taken across the region. It will add impetus to our work if countries of similar geographical and cultural identity cooperate proactively to keep terrorism out of their region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">11 September posed a new challenge for the United Nations. The Organization has risen to the task of acting to raise the capacity of all Member States in counter-terrorism, thus catalysing global action to counter a global threat, but in doing so, we should recognize the added burden which this activity has placed on the Secretariat. The translation service has done a phenomenal job in producing hundreds of pages of documentation every month to enable the CTC to do its work, but the pace of our work is being constrained by the speed with which the translation service can produce documents. I have discussed this issue with the Secretariat and shall continue to do so with a view to reducing demand wherever possible, but I call on Member States, in the Council and beyond, as a whole to recognize the heavy translation demands we place on the Secretariat and to reduce these demands wherever possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">We are doing the same within the Committee, but I am concerned that, as a new operation, the CTC tends to be allocated the resources that are left over when everything else has been covered. That does not reflect the urgency with which we need results from our counter-terrorism work. I should be grateful for everyone's help in resolving the administrative problem the CTC has posed for the Secretariat, because I am not yet getting the response I need on this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">I thank the Council for placing its confidence in me and the Vice-Chairmen to continue to direct the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We look forward to doing so with equal determination over the next six months. I welcome the intention of the Council to conduct a further full review in early October.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">I shall be very glad to respond to comments and to answer queries in this debate.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his briefing. I shall now give the floor to the members of the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahbubani</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset to say that my delegation would like to associate itself fully with the statement that will be made later by the Permanent Representative of Cambodia on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">I am also very pleased to be the first of many, hopefully, to commend Ambassador Greenstock, the three excellent Vice-Chairmen and the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) as a whole for the remarkable work that the Committee has done. The CTC is clearly at the tail end of phase I of its work. It has gone through more than half of the paragraph -- 6 reports submitted by Members and is on target to complete the task by the end of May. By all measures, the CTC has done extremely well. This is a point that I hope the Council will take note of this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">I think it is also important to bear in mind that we should compare our battle against terrorism to a marathon rather than to a sprint. It is clearly a long-term task that we in the United Nations have taken upon ourselves. Incidentally, in trying to find some ideas for this speech this morning, we looked in history books and discovered that terrorism is as old as human history and has, indeed, been practised worldwide since time immemorial. One of the earliest references we found was a remark made by the ancient Greek historian, Xenophon, who, 2,400 years ago, noted the effectiveness of terrorizing the population of enemy cities in bringing victory. We make this comment in the hope that in today's discussion we will reinforce the need for a long-term commitment in the struggle against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">To obtain such a commitment, it may be useful for us to reflect and to ask ourselves a fairly simple yet fundamental question: How exactly does the work of the CTC help to eliminate terrorists? We ask this question because we thought that if the other Members of the United Nations and the public at large can see a direct connection between the work of the CTC and the battle against terrorism, I think that support for the CTC and for this battle will become even stronger.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">In an effort to try to get the discussion going, we have suggested at least four clear areas in which the CTC does not merely produce reports and engage in discussions such as this one but actually has an impact in the real battle against terrorism. The first way in which the CTC does this is by forcing Member States to look carefully at their national legislation and to assess its adequacy in addressing the demands of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. If, in the process, more and more countries review their legislation, we suggest that this is one direct, practical benefit that comes out of the work of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Secondly, we hope that with the work of the CTC, the momentum towards the ratification of conventions and instruments related to counter-terrorism will also increase in pace. This is something we can measure and see: since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the creation of the CTC, more and more countries are ratifying the key conventions in the battle against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Thirdly, the CTC has directly -- or perhaps even indirectly -- deepened the mechanisms for information and intelligence exchange through the creation of a directory of Member States and related United Nations and international bodies and through the hiring of counter-terrorism experts to assist the CTC. All this flow of information that has come from the CTC is also very important.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Fourthly, the CTC has pushed for an increase in the assistance available to Member States in the fight against terrorism. We hope that the end result of all these efforts will be to close the various loopholes that exist in the international system, through which the terrorists are able to operate, either in terms of their financial systems or their movements. We hope that the work of the CTC will close these loopholes and have a direct impact on the activities of the terrorists. Ambassador Greenstock has also pointed out the need to consolidate cooperation at the regional level and to work closely with other intergovernmental bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">Here, we are pleased to note that within the ASEAN region, we understand this need and are trying to step up our efforts. I believe that last month Ambassador Greenstock made a lightning visit to Hawaii to participate in an ASEAN Regional Forum meeting, which was specifically dedicated to the question of terrorism. It is meetings such as that, which expand the impact of the CTC in various parts of the world. As I said earlier, we are pleased that the Permanent Representative of Cambodia will be describing ASEAN's efforts in the battle against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">Finally, I would like to end by touching upon the last point mentioned by Ambassador Greenstock: his appeal for more translation services to ensure that the reports of the CTC are translated in good time. I support that request and want to enhance it by saying that the time has come for the United Nations to ask whether it needs to provide more resources so that such translation work can be done in good time. If we consider the battle against terrorism to be important and if we believe that more resources are needed from the Organization, then it is incumbent upon Member States to agree to provide more resources to the Organization in this battle. I hope that we will agree to do that today.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fall</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, I thank your for organizing the present meeting to allow Member States to discuss, for the second time in this Chamber, the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. This demonstrates the Council's determination to fight terrorism effectively within a concerted and coordinated framework.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">My delegation would also like to thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock for the encouraging information he has just communicated to the Council on the work carried out by the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). Through him, we also extend our gratitude to the other members of the CTC and to its support staff for the volume and quality of the work completed. Sixty-two of the 143 national reports submitted have already been considered -- in record time. This says much about the work already accomplished by the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">We welcome the Council's renewed expression of confidence in the Committee's Chairman and Vice-Chairmen in carrying out their duties. We assure them of our cooperation and support.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">My delegation welcomes the regularity with which Member States are informed of the Committee's work through the Chairman's briefings. This without doubt attests to the Committee's transparency in conducting its work. My delegation supports the CTC programme underway and encourages Member States to cooperate further with it.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">We agree with the CTC and its Chairman that a consideration of constraints related to translation services is necessary in order to advance at the desired pace.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The study of the first reports allows us to affirm that the question of assistance remains central to our concerns. We believe that such assistance is required at the financial and technical levels. The Committee should identify sources of assistance and refer countries to them according to their needs.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Since the heinous terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, nearly all countries have expressed a real desire to fight effectively against the scourge of terrorism. It would be very useful to support that determination of States with the appropriate assistance in order to help them create or improve their counter-terrorism mechanisms.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">As for the group of experts, it would be desirable to ensure the effective representation of all regions. That would enable the concerns and experiences of all to be considered, with the advantages of a comparative approach. As well, greater coordination is needed between the various organs of the United Nations and those of other organizations, particularly regional organizations. In this respect, my delegation welcomes the contacts that have been established between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and certain subregional, regional and international institutions, and we encourage such contacts to continue.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">The examination of the second set of reports to be submitted by Member States to the Committee will provide a good indication of the additional measures that the international community will have to adopt in the fight against terrorism. The Committee will have to consider this issue in depth, and my delegation will make its own modest contribution in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">Furthermore, we hope that the work of the Ad Hoc Committee established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/210</a> to elaborate a draft convention against international terrorism will reach a successful conclusion during its next session. We also welcome the entry into force, on 10 April, of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which constitutes an important step on the part of the international community in the fight against terrorism in general.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">Finally, my country, aware of the urgent need to fight terrorism, will spare no effort to strengthen its domestic measures to that end. It will rely on international cooperation for achieving its objectives in that respect.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Levitte</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">France would like, in advance, to associate itself with the statement to be made on behalf of the European Union by the Permanent Representative of Spain.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Speaking as the representative of France, I would like at the outset to express my warmest congratulations and gratitude to Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock and all those who are working with him in the British Mission, as well as to the Vice-Chairmen who are assisting him, for the utterly remarkable work accomplished by the Counter-Terrorism Committee since it was set up. In setting up the Committee, the Council endowed itself with an essential instrument to play its full role in the fight against terrorism. Success was not guaranteed in advance: the task seemed so enormous and, at the beginning, the Council appeared so poorly equipped for facing up to its responsibilities. It is truly one man -- Sir Jeremy Greenstock -- who, through his capacity for hard work and his dynamism, as well as his concern for transparency, has made all the difference. I believe that we should pay a very warm tribute to him today.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">France attaches the highest importance to the Committee and its work, because we are convinced that the international community will be able, progressively and gradually, to eradicate the scourge of terrorism only if it works in unison within the United Nations. In that respect, I subscribe entirely to the judgement of the representative of Singapore: the Council has embarked on a long-term, marathon task, which will involve convincing all the States within the international community to equip themselves with a legislative and administrative arsenal that can gradually enable all of them to be effective in fighting this scourge together.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Today, 143 States have submitted their national reports. It could be said that that is a kind of record; but it is also an opportunity to address a message of encouragement to the 46 States that have not yet sent in their reports. It is high time that they took part in that collective endeavour so that the Committee can, in the time that it has allocated, complete its an inventory. The ongoing, exhaustive and unprecedented exercise of making an inventory on which the Committee has embarked is a kind of global audit of the state of the world's capacity to fight against the scourge of terrorism. The importance of this inventory -- this global audit -- must be understood by all, and every State must contribute to it.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretariat and the independent experts for the role they are playing. As Ambassador Greenstock told us, it is the combined efforts of all, including the Secretariat and the experts, that make it possible for the Committee to continue its work without wavering.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">The fact that some 60 evaluation letters have already been sent to Governments through their representatives is testimony to compliance with the time frame that was established. If all goes well, towards the end of the month of May that first stage will have been successfully completed. In June the next stage will begin: the examination of the second round of reports, which are now being awaited.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Like the Ambassador of Singapore, I would like to underline a second aspect of the work of the Committee that we believe to be absolutely essential: its dialogue with regional organizations. Ambassador Greenstock was right to underscore the significance of that work, because regional organizations are clearly better placed than the United Nations to facilitate assessment among peers -- among neighbouring countries -- of the state of their legislation. I believe that we must encourage such regional work so as to ensure that, in addition to the work that we do here in New York, a process is under way in various parts of the world that contributes to the general mobilization against terrorism. The Committee should also act as a kind of umbrella under which all the technical organizations concerned -- and there are a great many of them -- can work together. I believe that they have clearly understood Ambassador Greenstock's appeal to them to avoid duplication. The Committee should remain a central body. Its purpose is not to replace the competent technical bodies, but to help to bring a coherent approach to the counter-terrorism effort as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">Finally, I agree absolutely with the comment made by Ambassador François Fall with regard to one major area -- that of technical and financial assistance. The Committee has set up a directory with the purpose of listing offers of technical or financial assistance from both States and regional or technical organizations. France will make its contribution by sending a detailed letter so that our offer can be duly recorded in the directory.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">I also agree with Ambassador Fall's comments about the need to ensure broad geographical distribution in the provision of expertise. I would like to underline the importance of appointing an independent expert specifically to follow up technical assistance, so that it can be deployed for the benefit of the countries that need it. It seems to us that the time has now come to strengthen that aspect of the work of the Committee. We are moving from a world audit to action on the ground, and the appointment of a competent expert could certainly contribute to the effectiveness of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee in this new sphere of activity.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, here we have a model Committee. I think that this has to be emphasized, and once again we warmly thank Ambassador Greenstock.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tafrov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Bulgaria fully endorses the statement that the Permanent Representative of Spain will make on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Bulgaria is profoundly grateful to Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his very important work as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We would also like to thank his colleagues at the British Mission and in London. We warmly thank the Vice-Chairmen and all the other members of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">We fully endorse what has just been said by my colleagues who have spoken before me, in particular Ambassador Levitte. Ambassador Greenstock not only has indeed managed to show the serious-mindedness with which we are all familiar, but he has also taken the right approach to the daunting task before him by giving due weight to the political and technical aspects of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, which are intimately interrelated and often very difficult to distinguish from one another.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">I think that the great success of Sir Jeremy's work has been due to his openness, in particular with the media, and to his constant efforts to explain to the international community and the general public an activity that, ultimately, is not always very easy to explain. My thanks go to Sir Jeremy for his excellent work.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Bulgaria is very satisfied with the results of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. However, we note that 46 countries have still not submitted their national reports. We would like to voice our hope that those countries will be able to submit their reports as soon as possible. It is clear that there are many reasons for those delays. In particular, as Sir Jeremy has pointed out, for some countries the fight against terrorism is something new, and the administrative machinery in those countries lacks the appropriate means to carry it out. Our delegation believes that the Counter-Terrorism Committee should focus particular attention on that aspect of its work and possibly come to the Security Council with a proposal to accelerate the preparation of these reports well in advance of the review of the work of the Committee, which will occur at the beginning of October.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">We entirely share the view of the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee that virtually no country today can pride itself on having entirely achieved the objectives set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The implementation of that historic resolution is a long and evolving process.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Jean-David Levitte spoke of a world audit. That is exactly what is happening. I think that after identifying the scope of the problems we shall then make our way towards identifying the means of solving them. It is here that, in the near future, the Counter-Terrorism Committee will have to be put through its paces.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Like delegations that have spoken before us, Bulgaria entirely agrees that the regional approach has great potential. We are delighted to see that this is the approach the Committee has adopted. In that spirit, let me note that in the very near future, quite probably at the end of June, Bulgaria intends to organize a regional forum of the countries of South-East Europe at which the countries of the region will be able to discuss the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, I would again like to thank the Secretariat and the independent experts for the remarkable work they have done and express the hope that Sir Jeremy will continue his work in the same vein.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">It is good for us to observe that six months have gone by since the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, to take note of what really has been the significant progress achieved in its work and to look a little bit ahead. I want to thank Ambassador Greenstock, as others have done, for his vigorous, committed and creative leadership, and also to thank all those who have worked with him, because I am sure he would be the first the acknowledge what a tremendous team effort this has been, particularly on the part of the Vice-Chairs, the other Committee members and all the experts involved. This has been complicated, hard work, and they have done a tremendous job. I must say I think that they have had a lot of success in helping to focus global efforts on the global threat that is terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> was intended to enhance the ability of the members of the international community to combat terror over the long term, as some others have mentioned. There is no deadline in this struggle, no foreseeable end to it. We will have occasion to come back periodically over time to assess how we are doing. In that regard, I note and welcome Ambassador Greenstock's thought that the Counter-Terrorism Committee will preserve the potential for dialogue with all States and with each State as this process goes forward, because all of us, I hope, will be adapting as we learn more and as we achieve progress in the battle against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">All States have an obligation to comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, both in terms of the process that it sets out and by national action. We urge Members that have not filed reports with the Committee to do so. We encourage Members that have the capacity to do so to provide assistance to those who need it, to those who want to join the fight against terrorism and who need help in doing so, and to those who want to fully implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and need help in doing so. A number of States, including the United States, are engaged in this effort of providing support, and we want to encourage everyone to do what they can in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">I also want to applaud Ambassador Greenstock's vision of a vigorous and dynamic Counter-Terrorism Committee process and effort, including more direct dialogue with members, in the next phase of the Counter-Terrorism Committee's work and in addressing concerns about failures to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> or to comply with all of its provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">I want to join others also in emphasizing the importance of the roles of regional and subregional organizations in the fight against terrorism. Those organizations -- those that are willing to join in the fight -- have an essential role to play, we think, because they provide a local, regional forum of interchange, action, encouragement and assistance. They are well placed to encourage their members to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and they are also well placed to assist the Committee in monitoring implementation and in promoting international support for its efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">The United States strongly supports the deepening of contacts between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and those regional organizations that are joining the fight against terror. We, of course, support the course that Ambassador Greenstock has outlined for the future and welcome the continued strong leadership he and his colleagues have brought to bear in this endeavour.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kolby</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank Ambassador Greenstock for his excellent and inclusive leadership of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the important work carried out so far. I would like also to thank the Secretariat and the team of CTC experts. The tasks they perform greatly facilitate the effective and uniform implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by the Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">The legitimacy of, and global adherence to, the Committee's work is clearly demonstrated by the number of reports submitted to it. We look forward to reports by all Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Information obtained so far suggests that terrorist groups are already finding it increasingly difficult to receive funding through international channels.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">For the legal and financial measures envisaged in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> to function as intended, it is essential that all Member States implement the same barriers on the transfer of terrorist funds. Norway supports the CTC approach to offer assistance to those States that have not been able to report on their implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> to the Committee. We have submitted information to the CTC about available Norwegian experts in various relevant fields.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Norway highly appreciates the cooperation of, and partnership with, African countries in combating terrorism. Recently, Norway concluded an agreement with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on a project aimed at the effective and comprehensive implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in the OAU and its member States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">There is, in our view, no contradiction between the obligations set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> on the one hand and the obligation to protect human rights on the other. The effective implementation of anti-terrorist measures nationally should not be perceived by anyone as an excuse to disallow fundamental rights and freedoms. Continued contact between the CTC and the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will prove mutually useful.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wehbe</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I should like to express my delegation's support for the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and for the efforts made by Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Committee, his Vice-Chairmen and the members of the subcommittees and the experts to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">During the two previous stages of its work, the Committee was able to undertake important efforts in the implementation of its mandate. This was demonstrated by direct interaction between Member States and the Committee, as shown in the numerous reports submitted to the Committee under paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Committee has considered a large number of these reports. It has drafted letters of reply to States containing requests for supplementary information or legislative texts, in order that those States' national legislation be harmonized with the requirements of counter-terrorism efforts. Sir Jeremy, in his statement a few minutes ago, referred to the statistics on these reports, which we find encouraging.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The Committee is now entering the third phase of its work. This is an important stage, during which the Committee is to receive replies to the experts' questions and legislative and legal texts as to how Governments will confront this dangerous scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Our delegation is convinced that the failure by some 50 States to submit their reports to the Committee reflects no ill will or intention not to implement the resolution. The reasons for that non-submission were set out earlier by Sir Jeremy, reasons that, we believe, include the lack of financial, technical and administrative resources. Not all States are equally able to devote the necessary human, financial and technical resources to review current legislation, upgrade it and harmonize it with the requirements of the resolution. The international community and the CTC must assist these States in order to obtain the desired result: a universal response to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">It is encouraging that the Committee has reviewed this issue and decided to create a mechanism for technical assistance to those Member States that submitted reports and expressed a need for assistance, and to those States that so far have been unable to file reports. In this regard, we look forward to the appointment of the seventh expert charged with coordinating potential assistance and to the creation of a trust fund to finance that assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">My delegation supports the future programme of work to be undertaken by the CTC. We underline the importance of continuity in the bureau and the chairmanship of the Committee to ensure follow-up of the successful outcome achieved so far in the two previous stages. We also stress the utmost importance of the role of the United Nations Secretariat in assisting the Committee in the discharge of its obligations through the provision of expertise and translation services, and also because the Secretariat is the institutional memory of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">We believe that the States requiring assistance should receive it either through their delegations here in New York or through in their capitals. We also stress once again the need for equitable geographical representation in the group of experts.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">Our delegation expressed its opinion and position in detail at the meeting held on 18 January 2002. We have always stressed the need to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, regardless of whether the perpetrators are individuals or States. We believe that the international community is today more duty-bound than ever to put an end to the deliberate confusion and ambiguity regarding the definition of terrorism, with which we are all struggling.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">We must also admit that ignoring the definition of terrorism has encouraged some to ignore international law, norms and values -- which has led to grave violations of human rights and of international and international humanitarian law. This will also open the way to selective accusations of acts of terrorism in which some acts will be arbitrarily and indiscriminately included and others will be placed outside this understanding, such as State terrorism in which war crimes and genocide are perpetrated. We therefore believe that the international community must be more objective and courageous in describing the acts of destruction and killing being perpetrated against the Palestinian people, who are languishing under occupation and suffering from the most severe form of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">Hundreds of millions of Arabs are looking to the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the international community to cooperate in developing a definition of terrorism with a view to eradicating this vacuum and coming closer to the truth -- that is, if we truly want to combat terrorism. We would also like to stress once again that Syria is prepared to participate in any effort to strengthen the work of the CTC, and we pay tribute to the international community for the effort it has devoted to the activities of the Committee.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Belinga-Eboutou</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I would first like to extend my congratulations and gratitude to Sir Jeremy Greenstock for the detailed, current and enlightening information he has just given us with regard to the work of the Committee whose chairmanship he has assumed with such competency, commitment and skill. I must say that we are becoming accustomed to being spoiled by Ambassador Greenstock. It is always with great pleasure that we rush to the briefings he gives us on the Committee's work. As the Council will understand, it is a pleasure for Cameroon to endorse the well-deserved tribute that was paid to him a few moments ago by the Ambassador of France and others for his vigorous work at the head of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The tragic events of 11 September 2001 not only had the immediate effect of instilling chilling fear, they also marked the onset of a growing commitment to international peace and security by the international community and the emergence of a sense of mobilization and solidarity in the fight against terrorism, which is indeed a negation of the right to life. The unanimous condemnation that emerged in the wake of 11 September is evidence of the degree of revulsion aroused by acts whose consequences may be eternal. But above and beyond that condemnation, what is important is the individual and collective action of States. That is why we attach great importance to the adoption of tangible measures and to frank cooperation in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which we believe to be the best road map available to us in this field.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">Apart from the condemnation voiced at the highest levels of the State, and while awaiting the adoption of more elaborate national legislation in this area, Cameroon already possesses a general legal framework to underpin the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which Cameroon fully supported from the very beginning. The report transmitted by my country to the Committee is especially illustrative in that regard. We will of course be prepared duly to provide any additional information requested of us.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) has been in existence for six months. We are here today to try to evaluate the road travelled so far and to look towards the future. I would like to say right away that, as described to us in the introductory briefing by the Chairman of the Committee, the Committee's present structure and its working methods enjoy the full support of Cameroon. As far as the balance sheet is concerned, if we can in fact draw one up at this moment, I would say that we have been particularly struck by the number of reports the Committee has examined in such a short span of time. Examining 62 out of a total of some 143 reports is really extraordinary, especially given that the Committee had to organize itself and begin to examine reports while it was being set up and while its manual was being written, as it were. That is highly praise-worthy work. We should encourage such swiftness. This work was possible thanks to the ambitious strategy of transparency established by CTC and to the professionalism of the six experts and the members of the three Subcommittees, to which we should also like to repeat our encouragement.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">Cameroon, for its part, will continue to make its contribution to Subcommittee A, of which it is a member, in order to enable CTC to complete its programme for the third 90-day period. It is evident that the Committee cannot effectively accomplish its task unless all States fulfil their obligations under paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which calls upon them to submit national reports on the counter-terrorism measures they have undertaken.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">For that reason, in the context of the review of the Committee's activities during the first six months, my delegation would like to raise four specific points, concerning national reports, relationships between the Committee and States, relationships between the CTC and international organizations and, finally, a particularly important problem: that of assistance to States.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">First, national reports: here again, we cannot fail to welcome the major step already taken. Despite the Committee's newness and that of the field of its action, the Chairman told us earlier that 143 countries have already submitted their reports. I believe that is an edifying figure. We may rest assured that the remaining States will not fail to submit their reports in the coming months, it being understood that they are well aware that the effective fight against this scourge depends largely on the degree of solidarity in the international community. Only sharing and awareness of the national measures being undertaken will enable us to leave these horrible acts behind us.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The second point concerns relationships between the Committee and Member States. In our view, the dialogue engaged in since the beginning deserves to be maintained and strengthened. For that reason, Cameroon has welcomed and approved, in form and substance, the letters sent to States following consideration of their national reports. Also, the regular briefings organized by the Committee, seem to us the best way to enable all States to be sufficiently informed of its activities. Therefore, those briefings should be continued. Furthermore, the participation of an ever-increasing number of Council members in our debates and the large attendance attest to the interest of States and to their commitment to the fight against this scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">The third point concerns the Committee's relationships with international organizations. Cameroon believes that the dialogue between the Committee and such universal, regional or subregional organizations that have or intend to have counter-terrorism programmes, cannot fail to facilitate the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. For that reason, Cameroon believes that such dialogue should be intensified and at the same time that the Committee should remain faithful to its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">The final point we should like to emphasize concerns the importance of technical assistance to States. As previous speakers have said, such assistance is necessary and indispensable for the setting up and strengthening of national and regional structures and capacities in the fight against terrorism. In that regard, we welcome Norway's offer of cooperation to the Organization of African Unity. We should also like to return to our request with regard to assistance from the Committee and its member States for the organization and holding of regional and national awareness seminars. We believe that the appointment of an expert concerned exclusively with assistance requests could be extremely useful in that respect. We stress this point because, on the national level, Cameroon intends to publicize throughout its territory all legal instruments related to counter-terrorism. Naturally, the principal targets are administrative, judicial, military and law enforcement bodies, as well as on decentralized communities and civil society. Such an operation, if it is to be accomplished, will require varied and multidimensional cooperation from our partners.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa11">With regard to the Committee's future activities, Cameroon fully endorses the programme of work for the next 90 days submitted by the Chairman and reaffirms its readiness to contribute to the success of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, Cameroon would like to insist once again on the need to work effectively towards the adoption of a comprehensive convention against terrorism. As we have emphasized before, only such a convention will be able to fill the current legal vacuum and deal with the enemies of life: the terrorists.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdivieso</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">My delegation associates itself with the statement to be made on behalf of the Rio Group by the Ambassador of Costa Rica.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">I wish to begin by thanking Ambassador Greenstock for his briefing in his capacity as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and for his tireless efforts to maintain standing relations with Member States and various bodies and forums on our behalf. This is an invaluable task to which he has been very dedicated.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Relations with regional organizations are a matter of priority for the CTC. The exchange of experiences that the Committee initiated with the Organization of American States, among others, has allowed it to familiarize itself with some of the activities being undertaken at the hemispheric level and with the instruments that have been adopted effectively to counter terrorism. It is therefore necessary for the Committee to strengthen its relations with such bodies, as indicated in the briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">In the next phase, the Committee will have to embrace a broader vision that encompasses existing regional accords on counter-terrorism measures with a view to ensuring regional security. Currently, national reports are evaluated without being explicitly placed in a regional context.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">We believe that the CTC's competence allows and requires it to utilize the instruments at its disposal, such as the group of experts, the technical assistance directory and the so-called trust fund, inter alia, so as to maintain a fluid dialogue with regional organizations. At the same time, it must establish which of the counter-terrorism tools available to it are being truly effective at the regional level and, thus, having a national effect.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">My delegation feels that this does not imply that the CTC may interfere in the functions of regional agencies, thereby weakening their autonomy and independence. On the contrary, it strengthens links with such organizations by sharing information, establishing effective cooperative mechanisms and activities for technical and financial assistance to counter terrorism, adopting effective legal and governmental measures and strengthening border controls, in compliance with the international commitments of States to ratifying international conventions adopted by the United Nations to eradicate terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">In order to facilitate the technical and financial assistance required by Member States, it is undoubtedly important that the team of experts and the technical assistance directory be established, all of which is currently being undertaken by the Committee. In this connection, we must stress the quality and competence of the group of experts, to which a great deal of the success of the most recent phase was due. We also urge that obstacles be overcome to the speedy appointment of the expert in charge of promoting relations with organizations and States and of offering the technical and financial assistance necessary to combat terrorism. I also wish to stress the importance of an effective and operative trust fund provided with the financial wherewithal to offer the technical assistance that States require in order to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">The results obtained by the Committee over the first six months of its operations are essentially intangible or not readily apparent with respect to the original objective of raising the standards of States in their struggle against terrorism. However, an analysis of the reports submitted by States and of the reaction of regional organizations and States to the requirements set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> undoubtedly reveals that the objective set out therein is beginning to be attained.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">That is important because, in many cases, we must build where there was previously nothing. What is essential, however, is that, given the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the establishment of the CTC itself, each State be able to show some concrete and effective results in its struggle against terrorism and that the CTC demonstrate that it is acting in a global crusade to counter the gravest threat facing humankind early in the new century. As Ambassador Mahbubani pointed out, this is all very significant.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">I conclude by appealing that we remain alert to terrorism, which gives no quarter, is relentless and is already awaiting the opportunity, the right time and the right place to demonstrate its power to destroy and to sow fear and confusion among the people.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aguilar Zinser</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">At the outset, my delegation wishes most warmly to congratulate Ambassador Greenstock on his excellent work at the helm of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and to express the hope that he will continue in that position for a further six months. We also thank the Chairmen of the three sub-committees and express our appreciation to the experts and the Secretariat staff who have been working with Ambassador Greenstock.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">The establishment of the CTC was an innovative response of the international community to problems relating to peace and security. It was an expression of the readiness of States to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which was unprecedented in its requirements upon all States Members of the United Nations. The CTC is thus a tool for implementing such requirements and represents progress in strengthening international security law and the United Nations special role in the struggle against terrorism. The Committee's performance will determine not only the success of this vital struggle of our times, but also the progress and consolidation of international law as a civilizing factor.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">We feel that the Committee must continue to ensure cooperation, transparency and objectivity in its work and at all costs avoid any politicization of its activities. My delegation believes that there are five premises that must guide the work of the Committee and the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">First, it must continue to enjoy the political support and resolve of Member States to comply with obligations emanating from <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and commitments contained in existing international treaties and agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">Secondly, the determination of States to combat terrorism must be strengthened within the context of multilateral agreements, efforts and actions undertaken in the context of international law, in contrast to unilateral activities.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">Thirdly, the ability of the United Nations and of the Security Council to ensure the implementation of their own resolutions must be maintained. Hence the importance of the Committee's work and of the support that all must give it.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">Fourthly, my country believes that credibility and transparency are fundamental because they ensure the international community's confidence in the role of the United Nations and in the effectiveness of its resolutions and instruments. The Committee's credibility in the effective fight against terrorism constitutes crucial support for our multilateral legal and institutional actions. Today's open meeting strengthens the credibility and transparency of the Committee's work. That is why the Committee must continue -- as it has done so far -- to act on the basis of trust through dialogue among it's members and with all Member States. So far, this has been achieved through the very instructive informal meetings that Ambassador Greenstock has organized with Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">Fifthly, we consider full respect for human rights and the observance of international law to be essential for the Committee's work. Mexico considers that the international community's measures to combat terrorism must not jeopardize the protection of human rights and the rights of genuine refugees. Otherwise, the legitimacy of all our efforts to eradicate terrorism will be diminished and be in significant conflict with the principles that must govern our action.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">The challenge in the fight against terrorism is to find a balance between the universal protection of human rights and the ability to respond to terrorism. The universal system for the protection of human rights is based on the Charter of the United Nations and on other legal instruments. As a result, Members States always and in all circumstances have the obligation to ensure that their conduct complies with those legal imperatives.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">That is why our delegation has particular interest in the briefing to the Committee by Mrs. Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Committee should receive regular briefings on this issue from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">We believe that it is important that the Committee be persistent in its efforts to conclude the initial review of national reports by 31 May. Meeting its deadlines will enable the Committee to advance at a satisfactory and efficient pace. We also believe that the Committee should continue its efforts to achieve uniformity of content in the letters it sends to States as a result of the expert analysis of the national reports.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">The international assistance required by States is key to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Committee should continue its initiatives to offer assistance to States that require it. In this endeavour it should enjoy all the assistance and support the Organization can offer. It also requires that the contributions to the Committee continue to increase.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa13">Thus, we value the Chairman's timely vision for progress through a coordination strategy among States and organizations at the international and regional levels, with the objective of improving the ability to fight terrorism and of avoiding duplication among the various assistance programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa14">We value the dialogue held a few weeks ago with César Gaviria, Secretary-General of the Organization of the American States (OAS). I wish to mention that the OAS recently approved the draft Inter-American Convention for the Prevention and Elimination of Terrorism, in the framework of a working group headed by Mexico.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa15">Our efforts in this area also extend to the subregional level, namely, North America. Mexico, the United States and Canada are working on trilateral strategies for border security in order to prevent the movement of terrorists through our area. I also wish to underline the efforts of the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism in improving border security.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa16">Another element to consider in the fight against terrorism is that we must insist that all efforts conform to the provisions of the United Nations Charter and of international law. The use of force is not without its limits; it must be governed by a valid interpretation of the legitimate right of self-defence and must in all circumstances conform to the principle of proportionality.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa17">Finally, I wish to mention that my country endorses the proposals and statements to be made later in this meeting in the name of the Rio Group.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Yingfan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I would like to begin by thanking Ambassador Greenstock for his briefing on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). Under his leadership, the CTC has done much fruitful work since its establishment. It has formulated a pragmatic programme of work, and its open, fair and transparent approach has met with the appreciation of the membership at large.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">In its current consideration of national reports, the Committee is guided by the relevant provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the relevant working guidelines. With good cooperation and coordination, its Subcommittees have made good progress. We believe that this is all due to the able leadership of its Chairman and Vice-Chairmen, who have the active cooperation and support of the other Members of the United Nations. It can also be attributed to the efforts of the experts and of the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Like other members of the Council, we endorse the work programme for the third 90-day period approved by the Committee, and we view favourably the current composition of the Bureau.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">We believe that two points merit the attention of the Committee. First, there should be a focus on questions relating to assistance to Member States in implementing the resolution. We hope that, as soon as possible, an assistance fund will be set up, within the framework of the United Nations, that will help Member States to enhance their ability to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Secondly, we should always keep in mind the fact that the main objective of the CTC is to assist Member States so that they can improve their own legislative and administrative capacity to fight terrorism and take part more effectively in international cooperation against terrorism. To that end, the review should be focused; that will help the CTC to conclude its consideration of the national reports within the appropriate time frame.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">The current international fight against terrorism has been continuing for more than seven months -- since last September. Some practical problems have emerged during that fight that have raised concern on the part of the international community, and the Council should give due attention to those problems. The question of whether the CTC should, at an appropriate time, respond to certain problems, and the form that such a response should take, merits our consideration. States Members of the United Nations hope that the Council will continue to play its central role in the international fight against terrorism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gokool</span> <span class="nation">Mauritius</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">My delegation would like to thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Greenstock, for his comprehensive and informative briefing on the work of the Committee. My delegation also joins others in commending him and his staff for the very good work done by the Committee. Let me also express my satisfaction for the immense contribution of the Secretariat and the experts to the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">My delegation associates itself with the views and comments expressed by Ambassador Greenstock on the work of the Committee, and we fully support the contents of the draft presidential statement to be adopted after this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">The overwhelming response to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by Member States is not only a manifestation of the international global alliance against the scourge of terrorism, but is also telling evidence of the desire of each Member State to rid its territory of terrorism. Perhaps this is the first resolution ever to receive such a degree of acclaim and support from Members. Indeed, it must be. When we see the indiscriminate atrocities and callous violence meted out to innocent citizens by barbaric acts of terrorism, when we assess the economic and social damage and the disruption resulting from irresponsible terrorist acts, and, most of all, when we imagine the trials and traumas suffered by the victims and their families, including women and children, we realize the imperative need for immediate action at the national, regional and international level with a view to doing away with the plague that international terrorism represents.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">The work conducted by the CTC during the first and second 90-day periods is, indeed, impressive. Most of all, we appreciate the transparent and even-handed manner in which the Committee has been operating. We strongly support the procedures that have been adopted; they have been very rewarding in terms of establishing confidence-building measures between Member States and the CTC. As Mauritius is one of the vice-chairmen of the Committee, my delegation would like to thank the members of the Council for the confidence placed in our delegation. We will continue to work with determination and to shoulder the responsibility of the vice-chairmanship over the next six months with full dedication.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">Terrorism cannot be wiped out on this planet without the true and genuine engagement of all countries, individually and collectively. The submission of reports by countries is only the initial stage in the process. Constructive action to combat terrorism will require more than pledges and promises. Effective enforcement at the domestic level of the international conventions signed by Member States would be a good start. In addition, it will be necessary for each country to incorporate the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> into its domestic legislation.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">Allow me to make a few remarks on our experiences with respect to our vice-chairmanship of the Committee and Chairmanship of Subcommittee B. We have been confronted with many questions from the Member States that have so far been invited to our meetings to take cognizance of the draft letters addressed to them following the assessment of their respective reports. Here, we would like to share some of their concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">First, States have asked whether some of the questions in the draft letter might not be beyond the scope and purview of the mandate of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Secondly, they have asked whether the answers to the questions set out in the draft letters would in any way help in understanding whether, or concluding that, a country has complied with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> or whether it has taken sufficient steps to deal with the problem of international terrorism. Thirdly, they have asked what the next course of action might be after the reports of all Member States have been thoroughly studied at the level of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">While we do not have clear and precise replies to those questions, we believe that the objectives set out in the resolution speak for themselves, and the very comprehensive statement of the Chairman today will help us to clarify many of the points raised.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">Another pertinent question is the linkage between respect for human rights and the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is the view of many Member States that anti-terrorism measures should not be an excuse for the violation of human rights. It is important to remind ourselves of what the Secretary-General said at a meeting of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on 12 April this year. He said:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg014-bk02-pa10">"while the Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, this Commission has a particular responsibility to promote the international implementation of human rights. Therefore it must make every effort to protect those threatened by violations of human rights, whether these violations result directly from terrorism or are committed in the name of counter-terrorism."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa11">Finally, let me conclude by making two observations. First, terrorism is the enemy of peace, life, hope and society. It is the enemy of all that we should strive for and of the aspirations of ordinary people. Secondly, in order to fight terrorism and eradicate it from the globe, it is important to address its causes.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Corr</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I would like first to thank you, Mr. President, for arranging today's open meeting of the Council on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">Ireland fully associates itself with the statement to be delivered by Spain later in the debate on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> remains a defining architectural under-pinning in the fight by the international community against international terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism Committee, for its part, has played an indispensable role in monitoring and shaping the response of States in implementing the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. As the three 90-day work programmes indicate, it has done this comprehensively and rigorously, but also, in the view of our delegation, with sensitivity to the scale of the tasks involved, with openness to the views and perspectives of the wider United Nations membership, and in a spirit of genuine dialogue and transparency. Ireland appreciates this very much.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">I would also wish, in particular, to place on record, as others have done this morning, our strong appreciation of the work of the CTC Chairman, Ambassador Greenstock. I would also like to thank him, as well as his colleagues in the United Kingdom Mission and in London for what they have done. The scale of the task of establishing the CTC and getting it off to such a strong start was very daunting and demanding. It required a huge commitment of time and energy by Ambassador Greenstock. So, I want to warmly thank him for this. Ireland also appreciates the dedicated, committed work of the three Vice-Chairmen, the experts appointed to assist the Committee and, of course, the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">At this stage in our meeting, there is no need to repeat the many points already made this morning. I would like, however, to make a few general points of importance to my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">First it is of great importance that the CTC continue its present approach of dialogue and of openness to the concerns of United Nations Members. For many States, and not because of any lack of political determination, the legislative and administrative requirements of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> are complex and daunting. There needs to be sustained appreciation of this, and concomitant support from those most capable of providing it.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">Secondly, as we progress in the period ahead into more detailed assessments regarding the implementation by States of the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, we must also be careful, as at present, not to micro-manage or to prescribe beyond the requirements actually laid down in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">My delegation fully takes the point -- and Ambassador Greenstock rightly emphasized this in his remarks -- that reaching a measure of confidence that States are taking action on all the issues does not equate to declaring any Member State to be 100-per-cent compliant. It is also, I think, worth emphasizing as a related point that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is clear on what is required. We must avoid going beyond the spirit or the letter of its provisions. The fight against terrorism is now, so to speak, a global public good and is almost universally regarded as such. That perception must be strengthened, not diminished, over time. This means that a realistic sense of the complexity of things, not any spirit of Manichaeanism, will continue to be our safest guide towards our agreed goals. We are, in summary, the guardians of the spirit as well as the detail of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">Thirdly, Ireland attaches the utmost importance to support by the United Nations, and by the international community generally, for the efforts of developing countries where this is necessary to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>. This may involve the provision of expertise and assistance as appropriate or, in many cases, pointing to where it is available. It must not mean, of course, a diminution of development assistance for other goals. This also means that we need to understand fully that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> poses particular challenges to many developing countries and to continue fully to take this into account in our work.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">Fourthly, Ireland strongly welcomes, as others have this morning, the work of the CTC and its Chair in encouraging regional organizations to work together in the fight against terrorism. This is more than important; it is essential.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa11">Fifthly, on a wider level, we believe that the fight against terrorism can never be at the expense of human rights. Here, my delegation is in full agreement with what the Secretary-General said to the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on 12 April:</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa12">"Let us, therefore, be careful not to place whole communities under suspicion, and subject them to harassment, because of acts committed by some of their members. Nor must we allow the struggle against terrorism to become a pretext for the suppression of legitimate opposition or dissent." (<i>Press release <a href="../pdf/SG-SM-8196.pdf" class="nolink">SG/SM/8196</a></i>)</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa13">Not only are such measures profoundly unjust. They are also liable to achieve the precise opposite of the desired effect by driving more members of the targeted groups to resort to violence. In short, the Secretary-General went on to say, "any sacrifice of human rights in the struggle against terror is not only wrong in itself, but will ultimately be self-defeating".</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa14">I should add that Ireland very much appreciates the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, on human rights and terrorism as presented to the Commission on Human Rights earlier this month. This is an excellent example of the United Nations and its institutions looking, together, at issues affecting us all.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa15">Finally, Ireland endorses fully the remarks made by Ambassador Greenstock earlier on the importance of adequate provision of resources to the CTC. We understand the problems involved, but this is important work for an essential objective and, however we resolve the issue of resources, it must be done.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of the Russian Federation.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">We note with satisfaction that the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) is continuing to work energetically to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. No small credit for this goes to the Chairman of the Committee, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, to all the members of the Committee, to the experts and to the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">It is important that the CTC not confine its work to analysing the reports submitted by States on the measures they are taking in the fight against terrorism. The Committee must also constantly bear in mind the need to give advisory and technical assistance to States in order to enable them to effectively comply with their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The active work of the CTC in setting up close cooperation with other international structures concerned with counter-terrorism is of great significance. We expect that the appointment of an additional expert on that subject will give new momentum to the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">We also support the proposal that in selecting new experts due attention should be given to ensuring the representation of all regions. Of course, we support Ambassador Greenstock's appeal to the effect that the Committee should get the appropriate level of Secretariat support. We agree too that, at present, increasing interaction between the CTC and regional organizations is of particular importance.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Since Russia is the current President of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), I can inform the Council that the CIS attaches the utmost importance to counter-terrorism issues. We have set up the appropriate legal basis in the form of a treaty on cooperation among States parties in the area of counter-terrorism. In Moscow, we have established the CIS Counter-Terrorism Centre, in whose work the majority of law-enforcement bodies and special services of the countries of the Commonwealth take part.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Last July, a branch of the CIS Counter-Terrorism Centre was opened in Bishkek; it will monitor the situation in Central Asia and coordinate the activities of the relevant CIS bodies in the counter-terrorism fight in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">We support the programme of work of the CTC for the coming 90-day period. We believe it is important to begin preparing now for the next stage in the Committee's work, when it will be necessary to review the responses of States to the additional questions put to them by the CTC. It is necessary to establish in advance the methodology by which the CTC should be guided in putting forward its recommendations for the elimination of flaws in the legislation and practical mechanisms of States to fight terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">The Security Council has a clear general understanding that the Counter-Terrorism Committee should not, and will not, function as a repressive organ or in any way go beyond the limits of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">Nor should we forget that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> on counter-terrorism was adopted in response to one of the most dangerous challenges of modern times, which was described by the Council as a threat to international peace and security. The Security Council itself therefore bears the main responsibility for putting an end to this threat, in strict compliance with the Charter of the United Nations. Of course, this applies also to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">The positive trends in the work of the CTC over the past six months have laid a genuine basis for the effective implementation by the Committee of its key functions in carefully monitoring compliance by all Member States with the decisions of the Security Council and of the United Nations in the counter-terrorism struggle. Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council and a Vice-Chairman of the CTC, is ready to continue to cooperate in these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Spain. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta, as well as Iceland, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">The European Union welcomes this fresh opportunity to review the important work undertaken by the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). This meeting provides us with an opportunity to present the principal developments in the common action against terrorism undertaken by the member States of the European Union and the European Commission, in fulfilment of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">I wish once again to underline the historic significance of this resolution as well as the European Union's commitment to its objectives and instruments.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">We congratulate the CTC for the work it has done, and especially for the resolve and dedication demonstrated by its members and by the experts who advise it. The United Nations Secretariat also deserves special mention for its collaboration with the CTC and with the Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">I must also commend the Committee's transparency. Open briefings are now a common practice of the CTC. Those briefings involve a presentation by the Chairman of the Committee on significant activities as well as on key decisions and progress made in the area.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">Thirdly, we commend the CTC's concern for facilitating States' compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, particularly by providing information on offers of assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">According to the information presented, 142 national reports had been received by the end of March, but more than 46 States had not yet complied with that obligation. The European Union calls upon those States to submit their reports as a matter of priority.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">The European Union understands that, in many cases, non-compliance may be due more to practical difficulties than to lack of political will. Therefore, it is important to facilitate assistance to those States that face this type of problem. Several of the member States of the European Union and the European community are included in the directory of assistance offers published by the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">The European community has, through the European Commission, informed the CTC about the assistance available to third States in areas related to the fight against terrorism, such as finance, customs, immigration, extradition, police, the judiciary and so on. We encourage all potential providers of assistance, advice and expertise to submit an entry to the CTC's directory of assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">The CTC recently presented its work plan for the next 90 days, in which it states its confidence in its ability to complete, within a specific time-frame, the evaluation of the first series of reports and to begin reviewing supplementary ones. The Union supports this proposal for continuity in the review of compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">The assessment of national reports may prove beneficial in helping States to identify areas in which they should strengthen or supplement their domestic legislation or administrative measures. In keeping with the Committee's spirit of transparency, lessons learnt from this evaluation process must be shared with all States, and we trust that the CTC will know how best to do so. The main goal of the CTC should be to achieve a uniform, full and comprehensive application of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">Measures against terrorism must accord with the Charter of the United Nations, including the obligation to promote and respect human rights. That obligation should be taken into account fully in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa13">The CTC is very active in its contacts with regional and subregional organizations. In addition to exchanging information about their respective work in the fight against terrorism, the CTC can contribute very effectively to achieving a coherent approach by those organizations and coordination with their member States. We stress the need for a coordinated international approach to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Furthermore, we underline the role of regional organizations in facilitating assistance to their member States.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa14">The European Union presented a common report to the CTC in addition to those of its member States, and it will soon join with other organizations that have maintained direct contact with the CTC in order to brief them on its joint anti-terrorist activity.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa15">The Secretary-General has created a working group to review and improve actions undertaken by the various departments of the Secretariat in the fight against terrorism. We support that initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa16">The European Union takes note of the Secretary-General's appointment of the new head of the United Nations  Vienna-based institutions. We welcome the efforts of the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the Centre for International Crime Prevention as part of United Nations system-wide counter-terrorism efforts. In this regard, the European Union awaits the report of the Secretary-General requested by paragraph 103 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-253.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 56/253</a>, which will</p>
	<blockquote id="pg018-bk01-pa17">"make proposals to strengthen the Terrorism Prevention Branch ... to enable it to carry out its mandate as approved by the General Assembly".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa18">Even before 11 September, the European Union had been undertaking significant coordinated efforts, on the understanding that terrorism takes advantage of every loophole and of legal or administrative differences among countries.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa19">The European Union gives maximum importance to the fight against terrorism, which is the top priority of the Spanish presidency. The European Union common action is focused on the areas where it can contribute an added value to the national efforts of its members, complementing them.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa20">This common European initiative stems from a common position and an action plan adopted by the heads of State and Government of the European Union. In the spirit of transparency, we have submitted that action plan to the Security Council for dissemination. The Union's goal is to develop concrete common or concerted measures against terrorism within and outside the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa21">The Union's response includes a broad range of actions. Some are political, others legal or operative. Many entail a greater dialogue and closer cooperation within the European Union and with third countries.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa22">The implementation of our action plan is being carried out very actively. In the field of justice and home affairs, an important set of measures has been agreed. They include the European Arrest Warrant; a common definition of terrorist crimes; a common list of terrorist organizations; a new judicial cooperation unit called Eurojust; and Europol, an anti-terrorist task force within the joint police unit.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa23">With respect to the fight against the financing of terrorism, compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is well under way. The list of terrorist individuals, entities and organizations annexed to the common position of 27 December is being revised and updated. Just yesterday, a major suspect was detained in Spain who is believed to be responsible for the financing of Al Qaeda.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa24">The European Union is also carrying out an assessment of its relations with third countries in the light of their attitude towards terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa25">In the desire for transparency that the European Union shares with the Committee, we have sent the plan of action to the President of the Council, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa26">In closing, the European Union believes that terrorism is a very real threat to all States. International cooperation is therefore crucial in combating it and in ensuring that perpetrators are brought to justice. The actions of the European Union are aimed at individuals or groups of terrorists, never at peoples, religions or cultures. The goal is to strengthen international security, the rule of law and human rights.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Chile. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdés</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">Allow me to thank you, Mr. President, for your timely initiative to convene this open debate on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, at a time when the international community is confounded both by the appalling violence unleashed against the population of Palestine and by the atrocity of the acts of terrorism committed against civilians in Israel.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">That situation morally degrades all mankind and should lead us to realize the urgency of making progress towards the common goals that we set for ourselves as an Organization in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, namely, to eradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and to address situations, such as that in the Middle East, which feed the worst expressions of hate and resentment and thereby foster a climate that contributes to the spiral of violence and terror.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">Chile fully endorses the statement to be made shortly by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Rio Group.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">Today, my country would like to reiterate its condemnation of the terrorist acts committed on 11 September and to express its support for <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which seeks, within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations, to restore international security through the adoption of adequate measures to eradicate international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">Within that framework, we welcome the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council, established pursuant to that resolution, which recently put forward its programme of work for a third period of 90 days. We note the professionalism and transparency of its efforts and the wise guidance of Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock and his Vice-Chairmen. We trust that during this new phase the Committee will maintain the transparency of its work and the impartiality of its results.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">We urge the countries that have not yet submitted their national reports to cooperate with the Committee, whose positive results will benefit the international community as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">As we said in our first statement following the events of 11 September, Chile believes that terrorism is a rejection of the basic principles of human coexistence and that it is contrary to every civilized principle. Combating terrorism is therefore the responsibility of each and every member of the international community. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan has stated, the United Nations must have the courage to recognize that just as there are common objectives, there are also common enemies, and that to defeat them, all nations must combine their efforts, and the United Nations has a unique role to play in promoting this effort.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa08">That is why we believe that it is essential for us to underscore today the value of both multilateral action and the United Nations in this complex task. Moreover, we feel obliged to express our conviction that it is only within this multilateral framework that it will be possible to combat both those who make terrorism a way of life and the conditions that enable their hate to resonate among disaffected groups throughout the world.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa09">The fight against terrorism must therefore be waged within the framework of each country's respect for the rule of law, international law and human rights. Morally and ethically ambiguous actions which use that objective as justification merely hinder efforts to eradicate terrorism. Any State that loses sight of the ethical difference that separates it from the terrorist is giving up in advance the principal weapon that enables it defend its citizens, namely, the legitimacy of its cause.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa10">We are also convinced that the oppression of peoples, ignorance accompanied by extreme ideologies and especially the conditions of extreme poverty in which a substantial part of humanity lives are increasingly creating a climate of marginalization and dehumanization that encourages recourse to violence and legitimizes the actions of terrorists through the degradation it perpetrates. We should not lose sight of the limitations of strategies that reduce this combat to a simple question of military strength. Our strategy in combating terrorism must be based on a multifaceted and resolute approach that includes the commitment freely undertaken by our heads of State and contained in the Millennium Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa11">While respecting the mandate given to the Committee, Chile would like the Committee to also be used to gather experiences that would facilitate progress towards the elaboration of new concepts of security that are more in tune with the problems of the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa12">My country welcomes the recent entry into force of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, adopted by the General Assembly in 1999, on which many of the provisions of Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> were based. It also notes with satisfaction that in the Organization of American States negotiations have been concluded on the inter-American convention against terrorism, which we hope will be adopted at that organization's general assembly to be held in Barbados.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa13">In 2001, Chile, in its capacity as coordinator of the Rio Group, organized a meeting of legal experts to consider questions related to the prevention and punishment of acts of terrorism, and particularly to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The text adopted at that meeting was the result of a fruitful exchange of opinions on national legislation in force regarding terrorism and on their reform. That made it possible to take note of the progress achieved by our Group and the advantages of reviewing these efforts within a regional framework.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa14">Chile will participate in all appropriate forums with a message of total rejection of terrorism without relativism of any kind. To that end, it has a clear willingness to implement and apply the 12 treaties adopted within the framework of the United Nations on this topic. Chile is a party to all those treaties.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Satoh</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">Since the heinous terrorist attacks of 11 September last year, significant progress has been made through international cooperation in the fight against terrorism. This progress is encouraging, but the fight is only at its beginning stage. It is therefore essential for all Member States to strengthen their cooperative efforts to attain our common goal of eliminating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">In that context, I cannot overemphasize the importance of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), particularly its valuable activities to enhance the capacity of countries concerned with combating terrorism. I would thus like to pay my highest tribute to Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock and the other members of the CTC Bureau for the strenuous efforts they have devoted to the activities of that important Committee. Thanks to them, the CTC is already a successful institution.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">In the immediate aftermath of the 11 September attacks, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi affirmed that the Japanese Government is resolved to make the fight against terrorism its own responsibility and to engage itself actively in that fight. The full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is a central task in such efforts on the part of the Japanese Government.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">In particular, the Government of Japan places high priority on the swift implementation of the Security Council's measures in order to deprive terrorists of any possibility of withdrawing funds before their assets are frozen. In freezing the financial assets of the individuals and entities associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1333(2000).pdf" class="pdf">1333 (2000)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1390(2002).pdf" class="pdf">1390 (2002)</a>, the Japanese Government has been taking the necessary measures nearly simultaneously with the sanctions Committee's decisions to add an individual or an entity to the sanctions list. The assistance extended by the sanctions Committee is crucially important in order to make it possible for us to take such swift action. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Ambassador Alfonso Valdivieso, Chairman of the sanctions Committee, for his cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">Furthermore, in order to ensure the thorough implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and, at the same time, to make it possible for the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism to enter into force, the Japanese Government has submitted the relevant draft legislation to the Japanese Diet and plans to ratify the Convention as soon as the Diet approves it. That will complete Japan's ratification of all 12 anti-terrorism conventions.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">We highly appreciate the fact that the CTC has been vigorously conducting its work of reviewing the reports submitted by Member States on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Therefore, it is all the more important to urge those countries that have not yet done so to submit their reports to the CTC promptly. In that connection, the Japanese Government considers it a serious problem that many countries, despite their intentions, have not submitted their reports because they lack the capacity to do so. Therefore, we would like to call on the CTC urgently to consider what needs to be done to help those countries.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">Assistance to developing countries is essential in order to secure the global implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and such assistance could be better organized if the CTC could identify countries in need as well as the areas in which they require assistance. Such a step would facilitate cooperation between donor and recipient countries and would further promote the implementation by developing countries of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. From that point of view, we support the CTC's intention to focus its future activities on those countries facing difficulties in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">In this context, it is particularly important to upgrade the CTC directory of assistance, which already exists to a limited extent. To that end, we must urge those countries capable of providing assistance to register their assistance programmes in the CTC directory as soon as possible. The Japanese Government, for its part, has already registered its own technical assistance training programmes and has decided to double the number of trainees that it will accept for those programmes in 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">The Japanese Government supports the CTC's intention to take advantage of cooperation with regional organizations and other international forums to promote the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. My Government, for its part, will work to see to it that regional organizations and other forums to which it belongs expand their cooperation with the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">I would like to conclude by stressing that now is the time for all Member States to reaffirm our common commitment to combat terrorism and to renew our determination to support the CTC so that it can continue its valuable work, building upon the success it has achieved so far. The tasks that the CTC will have to face in the future will be far more challenging than those it faced during the initial period. In the light of this recognition, the Japanese Government will remain committed to do its best in support of the CTC in the months to come.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Heinbecker</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Since 11 September, the global community has moved beyond condemnation, condolences and solidarity to practical action against terrorism. To a very large extent, that action is guided by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which marked an exceptionally important step. We are pleased to see that this dynamic continues. We remain acutely aware that we must work in the spirit of multilateralism and partnership to find new and creative ways to face common threats in our increasingly interdependent world.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">I should like to offer my compliments to Ambassador Greenstock and to the Vice-Chairmen of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) for the remarkable work that they have accomplished.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Heinbecker</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa01">On 19 September 2001, leaders of the Group of 8 (G-8) issued a statement that condemned the terrorist attacks of 11 September and cited the 12 United Nations counter-terrorism instruments as the standard for international action in the fight against terrorism. Those conventions and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> provide us with the requisite counter-terrorism architecture. We urge all countries to implement these instruments as soon as they possibly can.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa02">Canada recently ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and, just last week, ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. That means we have now implemented all 12 United Nations counter-terrorism instruments. I should like to add that under our system, treaties are ratified only when we have the necessary measures in place to implement them.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa03">In their 19 September statement, the G-8 leaders also requested their foreign, finance, justice and other relevant ministers to draw up a list of specific measures to enhance counter-terrorism cooperation. As this year's Chair of the G-8, Canada has initiated a cooperative relationship with the Counter-Terrorism Committee -- one that, we hope, will mature into a strong and effective partnership.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa04">At the first meeting between the G-8 and the CTC, the issues of capacity-building and outreach were discussed. With respect to capacity-building, the G-8 respects the CTC as the central body for monitoring and facilitating the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The G-8 will cooperate closely with the Counter-Terrorism Committee, supporting its efforts in any way that is appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa05">In terms of capacity-building, we are aware that members of the global community face challenges with regard to both financial and human resources. Technical assistance -- providing expertise in a number of fields, from the drafting of legislation to law enforcement and security -- is perhaps even more important, and definitely more enduring, than financial assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa06">Representatives of the G-8 and the CTC have agreed to meet quarterly, with the next scheduled meeting in June 2002. In the meantime, G-8 expert groups and ministerial groups will also meet. We believe that, by the time of the next exchange between the G-8 and the CTC, we will have more progress, and more significant progress, to report.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa07">Multilateralism and partnership remain key if we are to develop long-term solutions to this horrific challenge to us all. The G-8 will focus on practical, multidimensional action. The priorities and goals are clear and the G-8 looks forward to cooperating with the CTC as we all work to meet these goals. No single country will be able to achieve its security on its own.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa08">I wish to say a word about Secretariat support. Canada is one of the countries most insistent on limiting the growth of the United Nations budget. We do recognize nonetheless that the membership cannot just dump new, unsourced obligations on the Secretariat. At the same time, we in Canada are also one of the more insistent countries in urging that resources be shifted to meet changing and new priorities. In our view, counter-terrorism is such a priority and we assume the Secretariat agrees. In fact, some parts of the Secretariat have adjusted appropriately and we call on those departments that still have not done so to adjust their support so that the CTC gets the back-up that it so urgently and appropriately needs.</p>

	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Ukraine. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I would like to thank you, Sir, for organizing this debate on the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">We are grateful to the Chairman of the Committee, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for his summary of the Committee's work and for sharing with us its plans for future activities, as well as for the excellent manner in which he and the other members of the Bureau have been conducting their work. We highly appreciate the efforts of the Chairman and the Bureau to achieve maximum efficiency, transparency and cooperation with all Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">I would also like to take this opportunity to express my Government's full support for the Counter-Terrorism Committee's work programme for the next 90 days.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">The CTC has entered a new phase. Its workload is enormous, but this is the work that needs to be done to achieve the objectives and we place our trust in the Committee members' competence and wisdom. We believe that the effective work of the Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Jeremy Greenstock, in close cooperation with all Member States, constitutes the most vivid example of thorough implementation of Security Council resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">As the United Nations brings together the political, diplomatic, legal, economic, humanitarian and security dimensions of the counter-terrorism agenda, it provides an appropriate framework for national and international actions. It is the base for our collective efforts in fighting terrorism and we believe that, as this crime is a transnational phenomenon, only multilateral action can counter it successfully. A useful exchange of opinions and information between representatives of organizations, States and the CTC would definitely benefit the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">In this regard, Ukraine welcomes steps taken by the Committee to facilitate dialogue with States and relevant international and regional organizations on matters covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We also attach great importance to the continuing communication by the Committee of regular information on its activities. This, in our view, is one of the essential prerequisites of its success.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">Another direction of the work that is successfully covered by the Committee is to provide appropriate assistance to those countries that are willing but unable to improve their counter-terrorism capabilities. I would like to express the full support of my country for the efforts of the Committee to help such countries by establishing a directory of sources of advice and expertise in the areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">I will not focus on our national report, which was submitted to the Committee, but let me underline some recent developments related to Ukraine in connection with measures against international terrorism that have been taken since the January meeting of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">This year, Ukraine will become a party to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. The relevant instruments have already been deposited by Ukraine. I wish to emphasize that my country is among the few Member States that have ratified the European Convention without any reservations. We also expect that the issue of the ratification of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, signed in June 2000, will be high on the agenda of the new, recently elected Parliament of Ukraine. With the ratification of that instrument, Ukraine will become a party to all universal conventions and protocols on international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">The Department of Financial Monitoring was recently established as a separate governmental agency within the Ministry of Finance. The main task of the Department is to collect and analyse information on financial transactions that are subject to mandatory supervision, with a view to recommending legal and executive measures against money-laundering.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa11">Under the auspices of the Council of Europe, Ukraine also initiated an international meeting of experts on illegal migration with the purpose of elaborating proposals for an international strategy to limit the spread of terrorism by strengthening migration regimes.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa12">Finally, I would like to wish the Committee and its Chairman every success in their future work. Let me reconfirm that Ukraine stands ready to make its worthy contribution to our common cause.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I now call on the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee to respond to some of the comments.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I just wish to catch up with some of the questions raised and comments made before people depart for lunch.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">I am extremely grateful for the general support which the Committee has had from those members and non-members of the Council who have spoken and for the careful thought that has gone into their presentations this morning. They have been generous in their praise of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) so far, but I want to underline once again, as many speakers have said, how important it is that this be a team effort. A lot of people have contributed to it, not least, may I say again, my own staff, both in my delegation and in the support I have had from London.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">I think that Ambassador Mahbubani rightly pointed to some of the areas where the CTC has made a difference, but I think it goes beyond his four points. The overall determination of virtually all Member States to do something about terrorism has definitely taken off since 11 September and since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. One of the most important of them is the extra legislation that is now being passed. It is not just looking at legislation which is now going forward, it is the actual adoption of new legislation. The increase in the ratifications of the conventions and the real cooperation that is beginning to take place in stopping terrorist actions and the financing of terrorism amount to more than intentions; it is actually happening now. And I want very quickly to move on to the area of assistance and make that an actual and not just an intended measure.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">There was clearly some confusion over numbers, because 143 plus 50 does not add up to 189. The fact is that we have had, as I said in my report, reports from Member States and others, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, the Cook Islands and Switzerland, which are not Members of the United Nations as such, yet. That adds up to 193. There are 50 which now need to move. I am grateful to those who said how important that is.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">It is the Committee's approach to liaise with non-reporters in a cooperative way since virtually all of them are not reporting because they have difficulties. Japan and others have said "well then, they need assistance, and that assistance must be arranged". That is something I now want to do. May I inform the Council and, indeed, the Committee, that I am now in a position to move forward with the appointment of the seventh expert and will take action on that within the next 24 hours. It is an important appointment and one on which I want work to get going.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">Regional organizations are absolutely vital, as many people have said. Frankly, I think that as we move forward in the CTC's work with regional organizations, this could be the beginning of a model of cooperation with regional organizations in other aspects of the Council's work. I think we need to give some thought to that. I particularly appreciate Norway's work with the Organization of African Unity in setting up a project to get them going in implementation, a project which I did not know about. Inevitably, because of lack of experience in this field, Africa is in danger of falling behind in this whole area, and I very much appreciate that sort of donor-State activity with regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">Cameroon and others referred to the whole concept of State responsibility. I think that Ambassador Belinga-Eboutou expressed that very well. It lies at the heart of the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In the end, the CTC can be only a catalyst for this, although, if we have to, at the end of the day, there is a bit of a stick to wave. But States must take on their own responsibility. There is nothing more important than that. That is where it is in their own interest to use their regional organizations and for that to be an active area.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">On human rights, I think we have the balance right. I have taken careful note of what the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has said recently and of what the Secretary-General has said. But I think the Committee has got the balance right. The Committee is in consensus on human rights: it is awareness and discussion and liaison. But it is not implementing action as far as human rights obligations are concerned. The Committee is working up to its full mandate but not beyond it.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">I will pick up some of the points from regional organizations and other Member States after lunch. But Spain, on behalf of the European Union, mentioned lessons learned and the spreading of lessons learned. One very useful paper produced recently on the subject of lessons learned from reports so far was written by the spokesman for the Committee's experts, Mr. Walter Gehr. It has now been distributed to all Member States as a resource. I suggest that the delegations look at it. It is a useful addition to the category of lessons learned.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">Spain also mentioned the Secretariat setting up a unit. Before this meeting, I discussed with Sir Kieran Prendergast whether the Secretariat wished to speak. I do not think that unit is yet fully formed enough to make an input. It will be up and running, I understand, by the end of June. In the next debate that we have, I hope that the Secretariat will make a full contribution.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">As for the Vienna institutions mentioned by Spain, there will be an important series of seminars and symposiums in earlier June. I will be going to one of them on 3 and 4 June.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa12">I will pick up other points after lunch because people want to get away. I thank everyone for the positive tone of the debate so far.</p>
