	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council commends the Central African authorities, the political parties and civil society of the Central African Republic for the efforts they have made for the ongoing success of the transition process. The Security Council welcomes in particular the spirit of consensus which the Central African parties have shown and which attests to their determination to continue the transition process to the end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council encourages the Central Africans to continue their efforts to ensure the success of the constitutional referendum in November and the satisfactory organization of free, transparent and democratic presidential and legislative elections in January 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council also pays tribute to the United Nations system in the Central African Republic and in particular to the Secretary-General's Representative, General Lamine Cissé, for his work at the head of the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA) and reaffirms to him its full support. The Security Council is pleased that the Secretary-General intends to renew the BONUCA mandate until 31 December 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the assistance provided by the international community to the stabilization and recovery of the Central African Republic, as well as the considerable efforts made by the member States of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) in the political, economic and security fields.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council calls upon international donors and the international financial institutions to continue to provide resolute support to the Central African Republic, including on the preparation of the upcoming legislative and presidential elections. It also emphasizes that their support will be essential for the country's economic and social recovery and encourages them to formulate in close consultation with relevant development agencies and with the Government of the Central African Republic a concerted development strategy for the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"However, the Security Council expresses its concern at the deterioration of the State's finances and of the public sector, and calls on the Central African authorities to act with determination in order to address this situation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the CEMAC Multinational Force and calls for the continuation of the restructuring of the Central African Republic's defense and security forces.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council also encourages the Central African authorities to continue to combat with determination human rights violations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council again expresses its concern at the possible consequences to the Central African Republic of the crises in the subregion. Accordingly, it welcomes with satisfaction the Secretary-General's initiative in asking BONUCA to assess the potential effects of developments in neighbouring countries on the situation in the Central African Republic and vice versa."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-39.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/39</a>.</p>
