<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">I give the floor to His Excellency, Mr. Bethuel Kiplagat, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development facilitator, in accordance with rule 39 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kiplagat</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01"> Let me add my warm welcome to you, Mr. President and members of the Security Council, for coming to Nairobi and for agreeing to discuss and to hear reports from us on Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">First, we express great joy over the fact that two years of work on peace and reconciliation and the formation of Government have now been concluded with the election of a President, the formation of parliament and the appointment of a Prime Minister. When we look back over these two years, we see many obstacles that we had to face -- perhaps the most difficult and important of which was our own scepticism, as Somalis, and that of the international community since, it will be recalled, 13 previous attempts had been made, all without success.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">So everybody has been asking us the difference between what we are doing now and what had been done in the past. The only thing we can say is that there are a number of factors that make us believe that this time around we have a greater chance that the peace agreement will be durable and stable.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">One important factor was the presence of all the major stakeholders during the two years of negotiations, all the major faction leaders. We brought in traditional leaders, who are here; leaders of the people in the diaspora and of civil society; religious leaders; and, more importantly, regional and international actors. We believe, therefore, that the presence of all these stakeholders augurs well for the creation of a durable, stable Government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa05">So that is the first thing that we need to take note of -- the presence of these stakeholders. But I would like you Mr. President to underline the importance of the regional stakeholders -- the member States of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. It was their cohesion, their vision, their commitment to working on the peace process that really brought us to the position that we are in today.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa06">The second thing to note is the way in which the Parliament was selected. We believe this institution is very important in the way it was crafted, with the participation of all the major political groupings of Somalia -- not only clans, but also sub-sub-clans: close to 89, representing all the regions of Somalia. The process was not easy. It took time, but in the end they came out with the names and the lists from their sub-sub-clans. Again, I believe that this is good news in the sense that there is representation right across the board. It was a selection process, and the role played by traditional and factional leaders, as well as by political leaders, was very crucial in ensuring that we have an all-inclusive Parliament.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa07">The third aspect I wish to mention is that of the election of the Speaker, other officials and the President. This was carried out by the participants in a very transparent manner. It took us a long time -- in some cases, 12 to 15 hours -- of peaceful voting, and we believe that the process not only reflected participation but also ensured that the people who have been elected enjoy the support of Parliament. We cannot say that this is the same as enjoying the support of the whole country, but their participation is absolutely crucial to say the least.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa08">Looking ahead to the future, those ingredients -- of Parliament being present, of the participation of the traditional leaders and of the process of elections -- give us optimism and hope that we will be able to stabilize the country. What is in store for Somalia in the coming weeks and months? The first thing is the continuation of the reconciliation process: the process has not yet been completed. The message of hope from Nairobi needs to be taken all the way to the ground. The Somalis and IGAD, have therefore made the issue of peace-building the priority, to ensure that everything else will follow as a result.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa09">Of course, there is also the reconstruction of the State, and particularly of Somali democratic institutions. All of this, however, will depend on security. Security is absolutely crucial to enable the Government to move forward. Hence, we believe that it is of the utmost importance that the issue of security for the Government be discussed and debated, and, hopefully, that we will get the support of the Security Council and that of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa10">Let us hope that the scepticism of the past will be left behind, and let us hold on to hope for Somalia. That is what is needed today.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">In accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdi Farah, Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and Parliamentary Relations of Djibouti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Farah</span> <span class="nation">Djibouti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">First of all, may I congratulate Ambassador Danforth most warmly on his assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of November. I would also like once more to congratulate him on the crucial role he played in the Security Council's decision to hold these special meetings in the region and to take up a matter that is of considerable importance not only to the region and to Africa, but also to the international community as a whole. We are particularly grateful to all the members of the Council, who agreed to include on the agenda of these historic meetings the important issue of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">This special meeting of the Security Council is taking place just a little more than a month after the Somalis, the region, the African continent and the whole world celebrated the swearing in of the new transitional President of Somalia, His Excellency Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, who is here with us today. That happy event was welcomed by Somalis and by the international community. It was a tremendous achievement, made possible thanks to the determination of the Somali people, who, enduring many long and dark years, never stopped hoping and working for real change in their lives. They understood that, within the context of the peace process begun by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the opportunity was provided to put an end to the deep gloom of night and to lay the foundations for institutions that would enable Somalia to be reborn.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">This achievement was made possible also by the perseverance of IGAD member States, which committed themselves to developing a consistent, agreed and collective approach, guided by a sincere desire to act together in solidarity with the people of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">I should like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere thanks to the Government of Kenya and to our Kenyan brothers and sisters, whose sacrifices and commitment should be acknowledged. We also thank the international community for its constant financial and political support for our joint efforts, which was decisive in enabling the process to be successful.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">I cannot mention all those who contributed to this success, but there are some I must mention because of the crucial part they played and continue to play. The African Union has been unfailingly committed to us and has given momentum to efforts to prepare for the deployment of a peacekeeping force in Somalia. We pay tribute to the European Union for its political and financial support; we are counting on it to help Somalia jump start its economy, with a view to attaining sustainable development. We are particularly encouraged by the constant support of the United States in this process. The contribution of the League of Arab States was decisive at a critical stage of the process, and it goes without saying that its material and financial support will also be essential in the future. And, of course, we must stress in particular the constant commitment of the United Nations and the resolve of the Secretary-General. We pay particular tribute to the Security Council's very significant decision to come to the region to learn more about the situation and to better understand the scope of the challenges facing the new Somali Government.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">The results of the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, held at Mbagathi, must enable us to assess the changes that have taken place and the prospects they offer in terms of the emergence of an era of stability, security and freedom in Somalia, the beneficial impact of which will be felt throughout the region. But much remains to be done before that promise is realized. The road is fraught with pitfalls. The challenges are huge. Continued support from Africa and from the international community will determine our success. Among those challenges, one cannot emphasize enough the urgent need to find a lasting solution to the problem of the mass circulation of weapons in Somalia and to its grave security consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">The negative effects that weapons have had at the economic, social and political levels are immeasurable. They have contributed to the emergence of a weapons culture and to the establishment of an atmosphere of fear. Those who possess them have a false feeling of security, because they have the capacity to defend themselves in case they are attacked by hostile forces. Accordingly, the pressure to acquire weapons is even greater on those who do not possess them. The result is an arms race whose devastating effects -- including disease and poverty -- are felt at many levels because the resources mobilized to that end are immense and could be allocated instead to vital sectors.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">In particular, weapons proliferation poses a serious threat to the results of the Conference -- particularly during the first six months, when the new Government, to establish its legitimacy, must respond to the immense expectations of the Somali population and must promote visible and significant change. The IGAD peace process is aimed at identifying the underlying causes of the conflict in Somalia; finding, to the extent possible, adequate responses to them; signing a declaration on the cessation of hostilities; and including all essential actors, including the significant components of civil society -- because it controls a large quantity of weapons and militias -- and businessmen.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">Thus, the transitional parliament is the institution within which all clans, factions and interest groups are represented, which is a first. However, the many initiatives we have undertaken will be seen as weak and poorly supported attempts unless they are accompanied by a serious, viable and well-performing programme aimed at disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating the militias. The new Government cannot carry out that task alone. It will need assistance from the Security Council and the international community in the form of the deployment of peacekeeping troops to ensure a peaceful transition, which will permit the emergence of a lasting peace, security and stability in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">In that regard, we welcome the preparation efforts of the African Union Commission, which has sent several observation missions to Somalia. We note with satisfaction the initiative of the African Union -- in partnership with IGAD, the Federal Transitional Government of Somalia and all international actors with expertise in this area -- to organize a meeting of military and political experts mandated with assessing the security situation in order to complete the process of preparing for the deployment of troops. It goes without saying that such an initiative will require immense resources. Experience justifies and reinforces the basic premise that investment in peace is always less costly than war.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">Our common objective remains preventing the outbreak of conflict through mechanisms of preventive diplomacy. Many regions throughout the world continue to be devastated by endless cycles of conflict aggravated by a lack of serious attention on the part of the international community. The consequences are disastrous -- the collapse of State institutions, poverty, instability, social disintegration -- and provide a framework where one can freely mobilize allegiances in terrorist networks and other Mafia-like structures involved in transnational organized crime.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">Therefore, it seems obvious that the Council must demonstrate greater sensitivity towards poor countries engaged in deadly and devastating conflicts. In that regard, we encourage the Council to significantly and decisively recommit itself in Somalia and to make every effort to ensure that the great progress achieved is not lost.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">As we urge the Somalis to be vigilant and to strive to consolidate the success achieved, we must seize the opportunity offered to the international community -- particularly in the post-9/11 context -- to help the Somalis rebuild their nation and put development programmes in place. We cannot allow our many decisions and valiant efforts to lead to lukewarm results, because that would undoubtedly be a historic setback.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa14">I am convinced that the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, will devote all due attention to this issue so that Somalia can once again find its place in the international community.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. John Koech, Minister for East African Regional Cooperation of Kenya, in accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Koech</span> <span class="nation">Kenya</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">I take this opportunity to thank the Security Council for having decided to hold this meeting in Africa, particularly in Nairobi. We understand that this is only the fourth time that the Security Council has met outside New York. That is indeed a great honour for us as a country, and we believe that it is in recognition of Kenya's commitment and role as a peacemaker in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">On behalf of the ministers of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), responsible for the Somali peace process, I take this opportunity to thank the Security Council for dedicating this meeting to the critical issue of peace and security in Somalia. The Council's decision to include the issue of Somalia on its agenda in Nairobi is a clear indication of the importance it attaches to the maintenance of peace and security in Somalia and further underscores the Council's commitment in the Horn of Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">I would like to report to the Council that the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, which was launched two years ago, has successfully concluded with the election of His Excellency The Honourable Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed as President of the Federal Transitional Government of the Republic of Somalia. I would also like to inform the Council that the peace process has achieved tremendous progress by establishing an all-inclusive transitional federal parliament and through the initial formation of a broad-based Government that saw the election of a President and the appointment of a Prime Minister.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The IGAD member States, with the support of the IGAD Partners Forum, have successfully steered the Somali peace process. Despite those achievements, we face the very critical and delicate situation of stabilizing the security situation inside Somalia before the Federal Government can relocate. I would like to ask the Security Council to assist in the establishment of an appropriate mechanism to facilitate the relocation of the Federal Government of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">I wish to recall that in their statements to the Council yesterday President Yoweri Museveni, Chairman of the tenth Summit of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and President Mwai Kibaki, facilitator of the Somali peace process, appealed for assistance to help with the relocation of the Somali Government from Nairobi to Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">I wish also to recall that the IGAD Special Summit on Somalia appealed to the Security Council to take immediate action to deploy a peacekeeping mission in Somalia, to assist in securing the new Government and to help train security forces for Somalia. We appeal to the Security Council to support the initiative being taken by the African Union in conjunction with IGAD, to deploy a peace restoration and protection force in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">We call upon the Security Council and the entire international community to give consideration to imposing sanctions on any person or group engaging in activities that could affect the gains made by the peace process so far and that could affect the functioning of the new Government inside Somalia. Finally, we request the Security Council to mandate all IGAD member States to remain engaged in the process of reconciliation, peacekeeping and peace-building in Somalia until the situation has stabilized.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">To enable us to achieve a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Somali situation and to consolidate the gains made by the peace process, there is an urgent need for the deployment of a restoration and protection force in Somalia to undertake disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">It is our hope, as a region, that the Security Council will come up with a resolution on Somalia that will assure the development of appropriate mechanisms for the creation of an environment conducive to the establishment of stability and peace in Somalia, in order to enable the new Government to relocate inside Somalia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">In accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, I now give the floor to Her Excellency Ambassador Kongit Sinegiorgis, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Sinegiorgis</span> <span class="nation">Ethiopia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on the question of Somalia. Actually, I do not have much to add after the comprehensive statements made by my senior colleagues, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Djibouti and of Kenya, but let me briefly add my voice by emphasizing that Somalia today is at a critical stage, after having gone through a devastating national crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">We are all aware that the situation of statelessness for the last 14 years has had a devastating effect on the people of Somalia, on the region and on the international community as a whole. Therefore, what has been achieved after a protracted peace process should never be allowed to falter or be reversed. Hence, it is highly important to realize that the tasks of the reconciliation process are not over, and that we cannot expect the going to be easy.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">In that regard, the task ahead, to say the least, is very daunting indeed. In our view, the major concern of the new Government should be to establish itself inside Somalia as speedily as possible. As was said by the Ministers, and as I am sure is obvious to the Security Council, that task can be accomplished only with the continued and active support of the international community. The new Government of Somalia is faced with the Herculean task of rebuilding the State from scratch; in that effort, the major hurdle will be the security situation of the country. In that regard, my delegation supports the statement of Mr. Kiplagat.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">Let me also add that in order to ensure the security of the country, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of the various militias is an absolute necessity. Therefore, the deployment of a peace support and protection force is also absolutely necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">There is also an immediate need to rehabilitate the seat of the Government and its institutions, as a whole. In that connection, although the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union have their role to play, it is imperative that, given the limited resources and capacity at their disposal, the United Nations be more engaged in Somalia than it has been in the past two years.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">The response of the international community to the needs of Somalia has to be commensurate with the gigantic nature of the challenge involved. At the present stage, Somalia deserves a great deal of attention from the region, the African Union and the United Nations. In particular, the United Nations should and must take a lead role in assisting the Somalis to keep up the momentum of the process they have now embarked upon in reconstructing and re-establishing the Somali State from the ground up. This is a crucial moment for the Somalis, the region and the international community. It must be reiterated, again and again, that the success of the Somali peace process is in the direct interest of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">While we are all grateful for the support rendered to the peace process during the past two years by the international community in general, and by the European Union in particular, we feel it is time that the United Nations assumed greater responsibility. The role we are expecting from the United Nations is not that of an incremental engagement, but an active involvement in helping the new Government establish itself in the country. No doubt, that is a process that should be led by the transitional federal Government of Somalia, but the full and unswerving support of the international community cannot be overemphasized.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">In that regard, we are happy to note that the international community, at the recent Stockholm meeting on Somalia, recommitted itself to provide structured diplomatic, political, technical and financial support. Such structured engagement by the international community is expected to be coordinated by the United Nations. In the view of my delegation, this should be supported and endorsed by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">I would like to conclude my brief remarks by saying that it is a unique opportunity that the Security Council is today discussing the situation in Somalia at the place where the new Government was born. In the past, the crisis in Somalia has been a source of frustration for all of us, but now there is a ray of hope. Let us all stand together to help Somalis help themselves.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to His Excellency Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, President of the Somali Transitional Federal Government, in accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">President Ahmed</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01"> Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your recent assumption of the presidency of the Security Council. I have no doubt as to your able leadership and wisdom in guiding the deliberations of the Security Council to a fruitful conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">I wish also to extend my thanks to your predecessor for the excellent manner in which he presided over the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">I am very glad that the Security Council is seized of the Somali issue.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">I wish also to take note of the appeal of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, which is contained in his report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of sustainable development in Africa. In that regard, I should like to commend the proactive engagement of the Security Council in conflict-prone areas of Africa. Let me encourage the Council to continue and further that engagement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">We are equally thankful for the Council's continued interest in Somalia, and in particular for its support to the Somali national reconciliation process.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">The will of the Somali people was manifested in the current all-inclusive political settlement and the creation of the national federal Government. The leaders of the armed factions are included in the new Parliament.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">We request the international community to assist us in making sure that these leaders abide by their commitments and national obligations. We have succeeded in bringing about a political settlement and we are in the process of establishing the basic institutions of governance. However, the most difficult challenges lie ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">Restoration of peace and security throughout Somalia is one of the first challenges of the new Somali Government. However, this new Government possesses no trained army, no organized police or any other security personnel at the moment. Based on past experience, it is incumbent upon the new Government to prepare a detailed plan for the mobilization and deployment of a stabilization force and the rehabilitation of the demobilizing militias. The Government is working on the two main objectives of consolidating reconciliation talks with the armed groups and realizing a tangible peace-building plan. I would like to reassure the Council that adequate preparations will be taken to ensure the success of the above-mentioned plans. In this context, we request the Council to take the necessary steps to phase in a peace-building mission, including the deployment of a stabilization force in Somalia, in the most immediate future.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">We made a formal request to the African Union for a stabilization force, composed of 15,000 to 20,000 troops. The deployment of such a force is no way intended to impose the Government's will by force, and the necessary parliamentary approval will be sought by the Government at the right moment. Concurrently, we need a national security force composed of 20,000 to 30,000 troops, both police and army. They will be recruited, trained and equipped to take over from the peace-making force at the appropriate time.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">There are many regions in Somalia that live in relative peace. A new Somali Government will work hard to maintain and further peace and stability in those areas. The Somali Government requests the assistance of the international community in sustaining reconciliation and reconstruction throughout the country.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">I would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation and thanks to member States of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) for their historic contribution to the success of the reconciliation process. We make a solemn promise to our IGAD brothers that we will work tirelessly to maintain peace in Somalia. Special thanks go to all IGAD partners in this forum that have contributed to this endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">All the above-mentioned tasks required to bring about peace and security to Somalia would need substantial resources. The deployment of peace-making forces from brotherly countries and the creation of a national security force will require funding from the international community. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the members of the Security Council to take the necessary steps to raise the funding required. It is not expected that the Somali Government will generate revenue for some time. There is an urgent need for financial resources for the Government to function. I would like to request the Council to take the necessary measures to provide the financial and diplomatic support that is urgently needed. In conclusion, your support is critical.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Thank you, Mr. President, for your statement. I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Aminu Wali, Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations and representative of the current Chair of the African Union, in accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wali</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">Once again, I thank you for convening this meeting. I also thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his continued engagement in conflict resolution in Africa and in particular in the situation in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The situation in Somalia continues to engage the attention of the international community and our organization since the early 1990s. We recall that in a presidential statement, issued in July 2004, the Security Council reiterated its firm support for the Somali national reconciliation process and the ongoing Somali National Reconciliation Conference in Kenya, launched under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and commended the IGAD leaders and, in particular, the Government of Kenya for their efforts in the search for peace in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">The Council also commends the international observers for their active engagement in the process. The Council further welcomes the launching of Phase III of the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, and asks all parties to continue their efforts to move the process forward and agree on a durable and inclusive solution to the conflict in Somalia and the establishment of a Transitional Federal Government of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The African Union reaffirms its support for that statement. It is gratifying to note that the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, with the support of IGAD leaders, has succeeded in establishing a Transitional Federal Government in Somalia. The African Union commends this achievement and reiterates its commitment to the peace process. We pay special tribute to the President and leaders of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and particularly to President Kibaki and the people of Kenya. Their dedicated and tireless peace initiatives in Somalia have led to the establishment of the Transitional Federal Government. We also acknowledge and commend the efforts and support of the United Nations, the African Union, the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the European Union for this breakthrough.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">In this connection we recall the communiqué of the eighteenth  meeting of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, which welcomed the election of Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed as President of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia. We call upon all Somali parties, including civil society, to extend their full support to the new Somali Government. We support the request by the new Government to the European Union, the League of Arab States, the United Nations and the international community as a whole to provide all necessary support to ensure its effective establishment in Mogadishu. In particular, we welcome the call for assistance for the disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration programme, as well as for reconstruction, in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">We call on the international community to assist the Somali Government in finding its feet after many years during which the country has suffered without an established, credible Government. We also recall the earlier appeal by the Assembly of the African Union in its third ordinary session at Addis Ababa in July this year for the Security Council and the international community to support the Government of Somalia that would result from the Nairobi conference, with a view to the implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reconciliation. We therefore call on the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and other stakeholders to reach out to all Somalis to effect broad national reconciliation. We believe that all Somalis, who are stakeholders in the search for peace in their country must put aside all factional considerations and fully embrace dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">On the issue of the humanitarian and development situation in Somalia, the most recent report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-804.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/804</a>) is disturbing. The cumulative effect of four years of drought in the Sool Plateau in northern Somalia has destroyed livestock belonging to the local inhabitants. That has resulted in the decimation of livelihoods, indebtedness and the general stagnation of the economy. As a consequence, 667,000 people are in need of urgent assistance. Of that number, 261,000 are categorized as facing a humanitarian emergency and more than 355,000 are considered to be facing a livelihood crisis. These Somalis are likely to fall into the humanitarian emergency category if external assistance is not provided.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">Although United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations have expanded their humanitarian operations to the drought-affected areas, much needs to be done. Increased international assistance will enable the Transitional Federal Government to address this humanitarian and development challenge effectively. We therefore urge the Security Council, particularly the international community, to contribute and to fulfil their pledges to the Somali Trust Fund, as that would ameliorate the complex humanitarian situation in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">The African Union welcomes the activities of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme, particularly in the area of creating an enabling environment for livestock and the meat industry, as well as in capacity-building, governance and support for urban sector improvement and city planning.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa10">We note with grave concern the gloomy picture painted by the Secretary-General's report that the security situation in Somalia remains disturbing and alarming. As a result, Somalis in Mogadishu and north of the city continue to suffer as a result of violence, despite the end of the hostilities. We appeal to the parties concerned to lay down their arms and join the Transitional Federal Government with a view to rehabilitating their country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa11">Now that the United Nations and the international community have come this far in their efforts to usher in peace in Somalia, let us continue to lend our firm support and encouragement to the interim administration. We call on the United Nations to mobilize a massive peace-building, demobilization and rehabilitation programme for Somalia and to make adequate funds available for that purpose.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa12">These are hopeful times for Somalia. The United Nations and the international community have waited for over a decade for this moment. We must not allow this opportunity to slip away. Somalia must never again be allowed to witness the horrors of the recent past. We therefore call on all Somalis to bury the hatchet in the spirit of reconciliation so as to ensure peace and stability in their country.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Guangya</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this open briefing of the Council this afternoon on the question of Somalia. This attests to the international community's attention to and concern about Somalia and demonstrates its valuable support for the efforts to promote peace made by Kenya and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). This will help to exert a positive influence over the peace process in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">I would also like to thank the IGAD facilitator and the foreign ministers of Kenya, Djibouti and Ethiopia, as well as the representative of the African Union, for their statements. I would like to express deep appreciation for their enormous contributions aimed at the achievement of reconciliation and the establishment of an effective Government.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Encouraging progress has been made recently in the Somali nationalization process, as can be seen from the establishment of the transitional federal parliament, the election of the speaker and President and the smooth process of appointing the Prime Minister. All of these developments have provided a real opportunity -- and a solid basis -- for achieving peace and stability in Somalia. We hope and believe that all the parties in Somalia take advantage of this opportunity and keep up the momentum by assuming their primary obligation and responsibility to restore peace and security, thus creating a favourable environment for the new Government.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">We welcome the fact that President Yusuf Ahmed, President of the Transitional Government, has committed himself to the promotion of the nation's unity and reconciliation in a spirit of tolerance and inclusiveness. We sincerely hope that the Transitional Government, having overcome the many difficulties and challenges facing it, will soon be officially established and return to Somalia to begin the process of national reconstruction and economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">The African Union has called upon the international community to provide to the new Somali Government all necessary assistance, including for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">We believe that the international community should respond actively to the appeal of the African Union. We are pleased to see the convening of the symposium by the African Union on the plan for Somali stability in the transitional period, and we welcome the convening of the meeting of donor countries in Stockholm. We are in favour of the United Nations playing a coordinating role to achieve peace, and we look forward to the submission, at an appropriate date, by Secretary-General Kofi Annan of proposals to the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">China has been closely following the peace process in Somalia. In recent years it has been the facilitator in the Council on the question of Somalia. We have worked hard to facilitate the international community's efforts in mediating the conflict in Somalia. We have provided material assistance, within our means, for the peace and reconciliation conference, and have provided humanitarian assistance to the people of Somalia and other supplies to the Transitional Government of Somalia. We hope to see national reconciliation, unity and the restoration of peace, stability and security achieved at an early date, and to that end we will work with the international community in continuing to play an active role.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">We greatly appreciate this opportunity to discuss Somalia with representatives of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union (AU), and we are grateful for the very useful briefings that they gave us.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">This is also an excellent opportunity to thank IGAD for its outstanding and successful efforts in moving the Somali national reconciliation conference forward, as well as the AU for its willingness to undertake planning for an observer mission in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Somali leaders have of course also contributed to the reconciliation process by their willingness to cooperate and work towards the goal of rebuilding Somalia. The formation of a transitional federal parliament and the election of the transitional President are a real breakthrough and a milestone on the road to peace. That gives rise to the hope that with this new momentum the reconciliation process can now be implemented by the Transitional Government in Somalia itself. We therefore very much welcome and appreciate the presence of President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed and Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Ghedi. It gives us an opportunity to discuss the road from here to peace in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">As our Ethiopian colleague has said, there are still daunting problems to overcome. Security throughout the country is a major concern, as is the humanitarian situation. The Transitional Government will be able to address those problems only if all Somali leaders agree to lay down their arms and cooperate with the Government in rebuilding the country, its totally destroyed infrastructure, its institutions and its economy. We therefore call upon the Transitional Government and Somali leaders to create an environment that will allow international aid to commence. President Yusuf has already acknowledged that the future political process will have to be broad and inclusive. We also hope that women will participate actively, and with adequate representation, in that process.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">Rebuilding trust in the political processes and institutions will be necessary in order to deal constructively with issues such as the future status of Somaliland. The question of impunity and giving the victims of war and humanitarian crimes a chance to find redress are other problems that I am sure the people of Somalia will want to address. The continuing engagement of donors in the coming years, including the United Nations and the European Union, will be necessary to preserve and help along the progress that has been made thus far. China has introduced a draft presidential statement underlining the willingness of the international community to prepare for that engagement. We would like to thank the Chinese delegation for introducing that text, which we fully support.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">Restoring the country will require the commitment of the international community. Let me therefore conclude by reiterating Germany's commitment to assist the peace process in Somalia as well as regional and subregional efforts in that regard. As a member of the Group of Friends of Somalia in the Security Council, Germany will continue to support the peace process through the European Union, which is by far the largest provider of resources in Somalia, as well as bilaterally by making available considerable financial, human and humanitarian resources and, in particular, by supporting the planned observer mission in Somalia.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baja</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The recent positive turn of events in Somalia merits the Council's attention and consideration. We are grateful to the President for convening this public meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">Today's meeting here in Nairobi with the main stakeholders in the Somali peace process not only serves to enlighten us about the current state of affairs in the country, it also challenges the Council with regard to what it can do for Somalia. My delegation welcomes our guests and thanks them for their insights. We would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate President Yusuf on his election to the Somali presidency. We congratulate as well the representatives of the key players in the Somali peace process -- the Foreign Minister of Djibouti, the representatives of Ethiopia and Kenya, the representative of the African Union and the facilitator of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) -- for the successful Somali National Reconciliation Conference and for the successful role they have played in the Somali peace process. IGAD's patience and dedication in shepherding the process is an example that we should all commend, recognize and support. The political engagement of regional and subregional organizations is invaluable to secure peace, security and development. Those organizations enhance the formulation of a regional vision of security and participation in world affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">Work to assist Somalia needs to begin now, while the Somali peace process is being fully completed, and continue until a broad-based and inclusive Government is set up and installed in Somalia. The international community must support the Somali people as they embark on reconciliation and reconstruction and the re-establishment of peace and stability in their country. At this time, the attention and assistance of the international community should first be directed towards the newly established Somali national political institutions, for the viability of the Somali State depends upon their proper and effective functioning. Thus the support of the international community, including the Security Council, is of paramount importance in the consolidation and strengthening of those institutions. The international community's support should also be fully felt on the ground. We encourage donors to contribute to the rebuilding of Somalia and look forward to the full realization of the peace-building framework envisaged in the Security Council presidential statement issued in February 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-3.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/3</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">After supporting IGAD's efforts in the Somali peace process, the international community must now enlist the support of the African Union, particularly with regard to its initiative to deploy a peace support mission to Somalia. It will also be helpful to know when the cabinet of the Transitional Government will be fully constituted and whether there is a target time frame for the relocation of the Transitional Government to Somalia. As has been said, security is the biggest obstacle preventing the Transitional Government from relocating to Mogadishu. We have heard what assistance is required from the Security Council and the international community to that end. It will also be helpful to know what steps the Transitional Government is now taking on its own to address the security problem in Mogadishu, as well as what impact the arms embargo stipulated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-751(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 751 (1992)</a> has on the security situation and on the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation or resettlement programme.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gaspar Martins</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">My delegation is particularly grateful for and would like to express its satisfaction with the recent positive developments in the Somali peace process since the establishment of the transitional federal parliament and the election of the transitional President. We welcome this opportunity to hear directly from the leaders of Somalia, in particular from the President of the Republic, as we meet here in Nairobi.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The Security Council's meeting in Nairobi is very timely. We are meeting at the right moment, as clearly demonstrated by the presidential statement that we will adopt later, as proposed by China. This meeting also represents a boost to the Somali process and to the countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), whose cohesion has been pivotal to the results achieved thus far.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The people of Somalia now face the most challenging part of their long path to peace and stability, which is the implementation of the agreement in good faith. A number of speakers have stressed the need for adequate support for the process. We would like to join those speakers who indicated such a need.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">In his report submitted to the Council last month (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-804.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/804</a>), the Secretary-General underlined the need for an expanded United Nations peace-building role and presence to assist the process. President Museveni also presented his view yesterday, of which we took due note. There is, therefore, a clear convergence of views on the need to support the Somali peace process. This calls for coordination between the African Union, IGAD, the United Nations and the League of Arab States, taking into account the responsibilities of each body. Furthermore, it can be successful only if Somalis are themselves fully involved. Particular attention should therefore be paid to the planning efforts underway involving the international community and the Somali people in formulating a peace-building framework for a rapid assistance package, as recommended by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The development aspect of the process is also fundamental for a long-lasting peace in Somalia. We therefore welcome the operational activities in support of peace being carried out by the United Nations, which are the basis for the work to be performed by an enhanced United Nations presence in that country. The national reconciliation and unity of Somalia should remain the backbone of these efforts.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Although my esteemed colleague from the Philippines has already read my notes, I will repeat some of those remarks. First of all, Pakistan warmly welcomes the progress that has been made in the Somali peace process. We commend the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) for this success and believe that it is an example that other regions can follow. We welcome the election of the parliament and the election of the President and the appointment of the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">We welcome President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed to the Security Council. We would like to add that we are very happy that the Council decided to discuss Somalia at this meeting in Nairobi; it is most appropriate that we should devote attention to this other critical conflict in this region.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">We listened attentively to the statements by the IGAD facilitator, by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Djibouti and Kenya and by my friend, the Ethiopian envoy, and have taken due note of these statements. We hope that the presidential statement that the Council will adopt will reflect the sense that has been conveyed that we welcome the establishment of the Transitional Government and reaffirm our full support to the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">It is obvious that security is a priority consideration, and the President has rightly underlined this aspect. Of course, a comprehensive security strategy will involve the consolidation of peace at the local level, the full process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, the creation of the national army and, perhaps most importantly, a process of reconciliation that involves all Somalis, including those who have thus far remained outside of the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">The President and other speakers have appealed for Security Council support for a stabilization force, and we note that the African Union's response to this has been positive. We hope the Council will be able to hold consultations on this request and that a viable response will be offered to give hope to the Somali people, who are proceeding so boldly on the path to peace.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">Finally, Somalia must be given assistance to make the new Government functional. Such assistance should not wait for completion of the peace process but should, we believe, proceed simultaneously. The United Nations should assume an enhanced role throughout Somalia, including in the process of reconciliation and building bridges between all Somalis, including those who are not yet involved in the peace process.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I would like to join my colleagues in expressing appreciation for the participation in this extraordinary Security Council meeting of the President of the Somali Transitional Federal Government, of representatives of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), of Member States Kenya, Djibouti and Ethiopia, and of representatives of the African Union. Their statements on recent developments in Somalia are very much welcome.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Romania associates itself with the commendation of the recent progress made at the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, culminating in the adoption of the Somali Transitional Federal Charter, the establishment of the Transitional Federal Parliament, the election of the Speaker of Parliament and the President of the transitional federal Government and the recent appointment of the Prime Minister. For those remarkable advances, tribute is due to the States members of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) -- in particular the Government of Kenya -- and to other countries and organizations, mainly the European Union, the African Union (AU), the League of Arab States and the United Nations Political Office for Somalia. We encourage them to continue their efforts in that regard. At the present crucial juncture, Somalia needs our solidarity and our dedication more than ever before.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">As provided by the Transitional Federal Charter, Somalia is now entering a five-year transitional period. The stakes are high, and they must be matched by the determination of all Somali parties towards peace and by the investment of the international community in support of their efforts. Prospects for a successful transitional period should be secured from the very outset. The most immediate task for the new Prime Minister will be related to the ability to establish a transitional Government that enjoys internal credibility and is able to fairly distribute, with political wisdom, the dividends of national reconciliation and reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The challenges lying ahead for the new Government are certainly notable. In the short term, there is an urgent need to improve and expand security throughout the country, first and foremost through effective disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) activities. Increased reconciliation and reconstruction efforts, accompanied by concrete steps aimed at building democratic institutions, would then pave the way for national elections at the end of the five-year transitional period.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Undoubtedly, the path leading to peace in Somalia after long years of severe conflict will not be easy to travel. However, the progress achieved thus far gives us reason to hope. Today could see the dawning of a new era for peace in Somalia. It is important to sustain the momentum and to encourage all Somali parties to assume their primary responsibilities in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">International support for Somalia remains crucial. Romania welcomes and supports the decision taken by the Peace and Security Council of the African Union at its eighteenth meeting, held on 25 October, to accelerate preparations for the deployment of an AU military observer mission in Somalia upon request by the President of the transitional federal Government. We call on the African Union, in cooperation with the Somalis and in close coordination with IGAD and the United Nations, to explore the most appropriate configuration and mandate for such a future mission in Somalia in order to allow for the smooth progression of DDR and other activities aimed at consolidating the security climate throughout the country. The ultimate aim of the mission would be to assist in confidence-building and to foster national dialogue and the peaceful resolution of whatever disputes might emerge during the disarmament process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">We followed with interest the proceedings of the planning seminar on stabilization in Somalia during the transition, convened by the African Union in November in Addis Ababa. In particular, we agree on the need for the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement between the Government and other Somali forces and armed groups and for the establishment of the necessary legal, administrative and institutional framework prior to the deployment of an AU mission.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">We also join in the appeal to the donor community to provide financial and material support to the newly established Somali institutions to ensure their functioning inside Somalia aimed at assisting in reconciliation, reconstruction and DDR efforts. In that regard, we commend the timely mobilization of the donor community, particularly the convening of the donor meeting in Stockholm on 29 October 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">In supporting efforts to rebuild the country, the international community needs to be guided by the expectations and needs of Somalis themselves. Somalis themselves must therefore reach consensus on establishing their own priorities and requirements for assistance through the expeditious formulation of a programme of action that contains concrete measures and deadlines covering the transitional process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">National consensus must be accompanied by consensus at the regional level. In that regard, we encourage the establishment of a framework that would provide for periodic consultations among members of IGAD, other States of the region and relevant regional and international partners as a viable opportunity to achieve a regional vision of the stabilization and reconstruction of Somalia. National and regional consensus would then brighten the prospects for increased international support and facilitate future discussions between the new Government and the United Nations aimed at exploring possibilities with regard to an expanded peace-building role and presence for the United Nations in Somalia.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Denisov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">We note with satisfaction the great progress achieved with regard to a peaceful settlement for Somalia, particularly the election of the country's President and the appointment of its Prime Minister by the Transitional Federal Parliament. A unique opportunity is being created to bring about the rebirth of a country destroyed by a long internecine war. We should like to pay tribute to the United Nations, the African Union and the member States of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) for their important role in advancing the peace process in Somalia. In the near future, we expect to see the formation of a Somali transitional Government, which will make it possible to swiftly re-establish a lasting peace in the country, provide stability, strengthen national reconciliation, develop civil society and restore Somalia's status as a full member of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">However, a breakthrough in the political sphere must be underpinned by tangible progress in the area of security. In that context, we welcome the African Union's intention to send a military observer mission to Somalia. But we cannot fail to be concerned at the periodic violations of the ceasefire agreement. For that reason, strict observance of the embargo on supplying weapons to Somalia remains urgent.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">At this critical stage of the peace process in Somalia, the international community must support the efforts of the Somalis themselves to complete the national reconciliation process. We are confident that the scheduled donor conference will help to define the best arrangements for international institutions and the new Somali leadership to work together in the post-conflict reconstruction of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">We believe that increasing United Nations involvement in addressing serious post-conflict problems in Somalia should be accompanied by a strengthening of the positive results achieved in the peace process. That will be possible, first and foremost, if the Somalis honour the commitments that they have made to the international community. We view the Security Council presidential statement to be adopted at the end of today's meeting as a clear signal to the Somalis of our readiness to support their efforts to peacefully rebuild their country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council and as a participant in the IGAD Partners Forum, will continue to make a practical contribution to the achievement of a comprehensive political settlement and to the re-establishment of the State sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">This is a very welcome discussion and our particular thanks are due to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union, which actually embody, in this afternoon's discussion, why it is that our relations with the African Union matter so much. The Somali people deserve stability and security, and we all have our collective interest in creating a Somali State with institutions based on the rule of law and the prospect of enduring stability and prosperity. We should therefore welcome the progress made recently with the appointment of a transitional federal Government and the opportunity that is now offered.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">I very much appreciate the contributions we have heard so far this afternoon. The starting point, of course, is as close to zero as you can get. Trying to build peace, establish stability and end conflict is pretty difficult in most cases, and we have to recognize that in the case of Somalia it is about as difficult as it comes.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Listening to the request for a stability force, I am struck, really, by the question: to stabilize what? And if we have a peacekeeping force, what peace are we going to keep? And that is not a question I ask lightly. We have to think very carefully about deploying troops to do that sort of job in today's Somalia. I suspect, therefore, that there is a precondition to the deployment of a large force, and that is that a degree of stability has to be restored -- perhaps through a clan-balanced Somali security force, but in any case a process of in-country dialogue needs to be established. However, there should not be confrontation, but rather cooperation, which will build upon and not undermine the existing areas of tranquillity in Somalia, particularly in Somaliland.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The key is a comprehensive ceasefire agreement that is binding on all parties. Here, the Security Council may well have a role to play in endorsing such an agreement. It seems to me that if the Transitional Federal Government can adopt the sort of positive and constructive agenda we have heard spoken of, it will deserve the strongest support from the international community -- a support that is tailored, of course, to what is practical and possible on the ground. We believe that the draft declaration of principles and the proposed coordination of monitoring arrangements discussed in Stockholm offer a sound potential framework for engagement. They need to be discussed with the Transitional Federal Government as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">I do not want to sound negative in what I am saying because, fundamentally, this is one of those cases where the United Nations has to take a strong lead role, particularly on the ground, in the proposed coordination arrangements for the international community, and be in a position to deliver whatever help is possible and is needed by the people of Somalia. So I would concentrate at this stage on providing maximum help for the observer mission, if that is to be put in place by the African Union -- as much help as we can muster on the whole question of reconstruction and development.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">And I believe we should try to help the Transitional Federal Government to move towards establishing the institutions that it will need, and the rule of law, in order to tackle the issues that are associated with the rule of law in the context of a growing stability and security. We should then look to be as ambitious as possible, because the lesson of history must be that failed States are something we should avoid, and that where States are close to failure, we must do our utmost to pick them up and give them every assistance, especially when they are as prepared to help themselves as the Transitional Government appears to be.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adechi</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">We are indeed pleased that the situation in Somalia is on the agenda for our meeting. The process of national reconciliation in Somalia was begun under the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and has now made significant progress in the last few months. That has brought back hope for a restoration of the Somali State with the establishment of the transitional federal parliament and the election of a new federal President. Those two national institutions can indeed fill the gap that has existed since the collapse of the central Government in the early 1990s. We also salute the appointment of the Prime Minister. We fully agree with the content of the draft presidential statement proposed by the delegation of China. Accordingly, I shall confine myself to just a few comments.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">We pay tribute to the coordinated efforts of IGAD and the international community, which have made possible this positive development in Somalia within the context of political discussions. However, the developments on the ground have not followed at the same rate, and we deplore the continuing clashes among the various protagonists. The critical security situation is indeed still disturbing. The same difficulty applies when it comes to building the people's faith in the institutions that are the necessary accoutrements of any modern State.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">In this connection, we urge strict compliance with the arms embargo and the re-establishment of an integrated national army. We also recommend implementing a disarmament, demobilization rehabilitation or reintegration programme, which could indeed enhance security throughout the country. We also encourage initiatives, such as that of the European Commission, geared towards preparing demobilization programmes supported by community development projects so that former fighters will no longer have any incentive to continue fighting.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">It is important that the new Somali President be able to establish as inclusive a Government as possible so that it can take over the functions now being carried out by the international community. We support his efforts in that context, and we would urge him to step up dialogue with local players to ensure that the conflict continues to be resolved by peaceful means and so as to restore the process of national reconciliation, which is essential to any national development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">We listened with great interest to the assessment of the situation offered by the ministers and the representative from IGAD. The prerequisites for stepping up the process are international support for security and increased humanitarian assistance in Somalia to stop the violence and help stabilize the country by ensuring better protection for human rights.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I would like first of all to thank the ministers of Djibouti and Kenya, the facilitator from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the representative of the current Chair of the African Union for the statements they have made this afternoon. However, I would also like to express our special thanks to President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed for finding the time to come to the Security Council and sharing with us his views and his vision on the future of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">Algeria has always been firmly attached to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia based on respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and national unity. We are therefore very pleased that, thanks to the tireless and highly commendable efforts of IGAD, in the last few weeks the Somali national reconciliation process has made significant progress towards achieving peace and security in Somalia, and in particular the establishment of the transitional parliament, the election of the President and the appointment of a Prime Minister. We are hopeful that a broad-based, all-inclusive and effective Government will soon be established and that all Somalis will seize this historic opportunity to make progress towards peace, stability and reconstruction of the country. Now that legitimate institutions are being put in place, it is imperative that the international community provide political, financial and economic support to Somalia. We are pleased, in this regard, that the African Union has expressed its readiness to assist in the transition process in Somalia, including in the field of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and we believe that the Security Council also has a role to play and responsibilities to assume in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">Together, we have to consider ways and means for the Security Council to assist the new institutions and the new Government to establish and exercise their authority in the country. We believe that we should agree on an expanded peace-building role and presence of the United Nations, as has been recommended by the Secretary-General in his last report.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">I will conclude my remarks by thanking the Ambassador of China for his leading role in keeping the issue of Somalia on the agenda of the Council and for introducing the presidential statement, which my delegation strongly supports.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De La Sablière</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">My delegation is also pleased that this meeting has been held, which has enabled us to listen directly to President Ahmed Yusuf, the President of the Republic of Somalia, as well as authorities from the region.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">It seems to me that this meeting demonstrates that there is growing interest on the part of the international community in Somalia, surely, because despite the great difficulties that we have been hearing about today, there still is a sense that one can perceive light at the end of the tunnel. So we view with great interest efforts that have been undertaken by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), with full awareness of the dangers inherent in Somali instability for the region and for the Horn of Africa. Efforts by IGAD have made it possible to move into a crucial stage. We would like to congratulate the countries of the region, Kenya in particular, which through IGAD have shown an outstanding commitment and have played a major role in this process, which has been painstakingly conducted and has required patience and determination.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">France is gratified to note the crucial stage that has been passed with the election by the Parliament of the President of Somalia and the appointment of a Prime Minister. To be sure, we, like others, are impatient to see the establishment of a broad-based Government, and we would be happy to hear that its composition will soon be announced.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">We appreciate the security concerns that have been expressed by President Ahmed Yusuf and the Chair of the African Union. We are aware of the problem, which should be given careful attention and discussed together with the international community. It could be addressed in various ways. That will be one of the first tasks of the Government.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">Let me add that, together with the European Union, France stands ready to participate in rebuilding Somalia, something that is crucial to stability in the region. In conclusion, I would like to say that my delegation would like to thank Ambassador Wang for having led our discussions on this draft presidential statement on Somalia, and I wish to convey to him that my delegation gives its full support to the draft presidential statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">I thank all those authorities who made presentations during this meeting for the help they are giving us in our consideration of the current situation in Somalia. Brazil has welcomed the election of the Somali transitional President, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, who is among us, and I greet him. And we welcomed also the nomination of the Prime Minister of Somalia's new Transitional Federal Government. We hope those developments will be followed by further steps along the path of reconstruction of the frail State structures and legal system.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">Progress in the peace process would not have taken place without the efforts developed by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). We value the role of IGAD and the relevant contribution of neighbouring African countries, which point to the strengthening of African conflict-solving capabilities.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">Nevertheless, despite all efforts, many roadblocks are yet to be overcome before peace can prevail. The security scene is a source of particular concern, and not all military factions participated actively in the negotiations leading to the transition. Consequently, not all of them are committed to its success. Businessmen and warlords continue to take advantage of the present situation.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">The African Union and member countries of IGAD are already discussing possible courses of action in response to the present crisis. We note that the Somali Government favours the idea of the deployment by the African Union of peacekeepers, who would help with disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, among other tasks. Brazil has consistently supported reinforcement of African capabilities in peacekeeping, and certainly my delegation will give friendly consideration to the issue of possibly sending a peacekeeping mission to Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">The new President has also publicly manifested his intention to work towards a peaceful solution of the remaining conflicts. We hope he will persevere and work as hard as he can to dissipate fears of a resort to force. In our view, the Council must continue to lend its clear, unequivocal message of support to the national reconciliation process and to IGAD efforts. I wish also to associate our delegation with the thanks that were expressed to Ambassador Wang for the work he has performed, and say that we support the statement before us this afternoon.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">Ten years ago, Spain was a member of the Security Council, and I myself represented Spain at the time. So I had occasion to follow closely the debates that were held, and I also shared the frustration in the Council over the tragic developments in Somalia. After ups and downs, all kinds of difficulties, the Security Council finally gave up, as we all know.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Somalia has since been abandoned to fate. The Somalis have spent a decade in truly difficult conditions -- to put it mildly. They have been marginalized by the international community, and have been in an appalling humanitarian, economic and social situation. Accordingly, we feel that the international community owes a debt to Somalia. That is why we wish to hail all the statements we have heard this afternoon from leading players in the Somali national reconciliation in process. As we have heard, that process is being conducted by the Somalis themselves, at different levels of social organization. With difficulty, they have been struggling to re-establish transitional institutions, with assistance first and foremost from subregional and regional organizations and with a United Nations presence. I would like to note the presence of the Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Winston Tubman. There has also been assistance from donors; I would like specifically to highlight the support provided by the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">This process has led to the establishment of transitional federal institutions which, we hope, will soon be followed by the establishment of a broadly representative Government which will have the technical capacity to restore the basic mechanisms of an administration and of public services. Clearly, international assistance and cooperation will be required in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">All of these efforts by the Somalis themselves, by countries in the region and by subregional and regional organizations, should be welcomed, acknowledged and supported by the international community. The Security Council already did this in its presidential statement dated 26 October 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-38.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/38</a>). We must remain ready to provide all possible cooperation to the efforts under way on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Specifically, we welcome the African Union's announced readiness to undertake a monitoring task and to deploy observers on the ground. But, as has been said here, much remains to be done. The road is not an easy one. And still to come is the crucial stage: the establishment of the new institutions on Somali soil. In our view, this must be achieved through continuous dialogue and understanding among the various sectors of Somali society. This is something that cannot be imposed, and the Security Council must stand ever ready to be politically and otherwise supportive of the entire transitional process; it is essential to re-establish the Somali State, so that Somalia can resume its rightful place in Africa and in the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">For those reasons, we wish to express our support for the draft presidential statement that has been prepared on the initiative of the Chinese delegation; it has been worked out and is the subject of consensus among Council members.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Landerretche</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">At the outset, my delegation would like to express its thanks for the statements made by States members of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), by the representative of the African Union and by the IGAD facilitator.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">For my country, the establishment of a Transitional Government and Parliament in Somalia is without question a very important step towards restoring peace and security there, after more than 14 years without a central government. It is our hope that the new transitional institutions will relocate to Somalia as soon as security conditions permit. In that regard, we regret that political progress has not been accompanied by significant improvement in the security situation prevailing in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">Moreover, the Somali reconciliation process still has a long way to go; genuine reconciliation among the parties still has yet to be achieved, and the original causes for the civil war still need to be adequately addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">We would like to take this opportunity to support and to express our appreciation for the efforts made by the IGAD members of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, in particular the steps taken by the Government of Kenya with a view to resolving the complex differences among the various Somali groups thus facilitating the reconciliation process. In particular, we would like to express our thanks for the interesting and complete statement made by the President of the Transitional Government, Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed. My delegation notes his statement and thanks him for it.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">Lastly, we would like to pay special tribute to the work done for peace and reconciliation in Somalia by the Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Winston Tubman, and his team. We also acknowledge the humanitarian and development activities undertaken by the United Nations in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">In conclusion, we would like to thank the delegation of China for introducing and carrying out negotiations on the text of the draft presidential statement, which my delegation fully endorses.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I will now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">The United States supports the Somalia reconciliation process led by the Government of Kenya under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). This reconciliation process is central to the re-establishment of stability and effective governance in Somalia. It is the Somali transitional officials who are ultimately responsible for establishing governance inside Somalia and in whose hands the prospects for future stability and peace rest.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">We urge the Transitional Federal President, Prime Minister and Assembly to focus on the immediate task at hand: the establishment of an effective Government, operating inside Somalia. The ability of the Transitional Federal Government to relocate to Somalia will depend largely on an ongoing process of reconciliation and on Somali officials' ability to reach out to a wide range of individuals inside Somalia. The transparent and inclusive selection of Government officials and the development of a strategy and timetable outlining the functional priorities of the Transitional Federal Government are critical elements of this task. After this strategy is presented, the international community will be better able to determine how best to support these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">After 13 years, the possibility of re-establishing a Government in Somalia may finally be on the horizon. It will require sustained commitment, honesty and good will from all Somalis. We urge all Somali participants to focus on the needs of the Somali people, while respecting the peace, governance and security that exist in areas not currently participating in the Somali National Reconciliation Conference.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, President of the Somali Transitional Federal Government, to respond to questions raised by Council members.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">President Ahmed</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa01"> Our Prime Minister will answer the questions posed by the Philippines. I would like to thank you, Mr. President, as well as the members of the Security Council, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) ministers and other officials, and I would like to express our delegation's satisfaction at having participated in this two-day Security Council meeting in Nairobi on the Somali situation and how to solve Somali problems. I assure you, Mr. President, along with the rest of the Council, that I myself and the Government of Somalia will do our utmost so that Somalia will be at peace as soon as possible. We are determined to do whatever we can, because our country needs peace and reconstruction. We know that our task is difficult, but that we are ready to face those difficulties, and we are sure that Somalia will be at peace as soon as possible.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk05-pa01">I now call on the Prime Minister of the Somali Transitional Federal Government.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Geedi</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk06-pa01"> I would like to express my thanks and gratitude to the Security Council. I take this opportunity to answer a few questions posed by Council members.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk06-pa02">The first question was about when the cabinet of the Transitional Federal Government will be formed. My answer is that I am consulting with all of the stakeholders and am within the time frame of the transitional charter of Somalia. So within the coming two weeks or before the end of this month, I will come up with my cabinet.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk06-pa03">The other question was about the relocation or return of the Government to Somalia. I think that my President stated that we, the Government, will not remain an exile Government. As soon as we form the cabinet we will move to Somalia, probably by January at the latest. The reason is that immediately after the formation of the cabinet, we are planning to send a mission of ministers and members of parliament to travel all over the country. Therefore, on the basis of their findings and assessments, the Government will immediately relocate to the country.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk06-pa04">Another question raised by speakers was how the reconciliation process will be completed. That is a priority of the Government, and the reconciliation process will be completed through dialogue and in a peaceful manner throughout all of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk06-pa05">Therefore, I want lastly to assure the Security Council that we will be able to address the tasks ahead of us. We believe that we have an environment conducive to that among the Somali people and in the parliament due to the inclusiveness of the reconciliation process and the achievements made so far with the support of subregional, regional and international organizations.</p>

	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">"The Security Council reaffirms all its previous resolutions and the statements of its President concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular the statement by its President dated 26 October 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">"The Security Council reiterates its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia and its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia, consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the progress made in the Somali national reconciliation process, in particular the establishment of the Transitional Federal Parliament, the election of the Speaker of the Parliament and the President and the appointment of the Prime Minister, which provides a sound and solid framework to achieve a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Somalia situation. The Council reiterates its expectation of the establishment of a broad-based, all-inclusive and effective Government inside Somalia that will continue the reconciliation efforts with all Somali parties.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">"The Security Council stresses that it is the responsibility of all Somali parties to work together to consolidate the gains made so far and to achieve further progress. The Council calls upon them to seize this historic opportunity for peace in Somalia by developing a programme of action and timetable for the transitional period, creating a favourable environment for long-term stability and making determined efforts to rebuild the country.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">"The Security Council commends member States of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), in particular the Government of Kenya, as well as other countries and organizations for all their constructive efforts to facilitate the Somali national reconciliation process.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms its support for the commitment of the African Union to assist the transitional process in Somalia, in particular the planning for a mission in Somalia, including options for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">"The Security Council encourages and urges donor countries, regional and subregional organizations to provide support for the future Somali Government's and institutions' efforts to ensure their ability to function inside Somalia and to assist in the reconstruction of Somalia. The Council encourages a dialogue between the international donor community and the future Transitional Federal Government on the principles and modalities of international coordination under discussion, including at the Stockholm meeting of 29 October 2004, and welcomes the United Nations lead facilitating role in that dialogue and in the subsequent coordination arrangements.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">"The Security Council reaffirms its full support for the peace process in Somalia and the commitment of the United Nations to assist the regional and subregional efforts in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">"The Security Council expresses its determination to continue to monitor the situation closely."</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-43.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/43</a>.</p>
