	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa01">This morning, it is our sad duty to pay tribute to the memory of His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the late Amir of the State of Kuwait, who passed away on Sunday, 15 January 2006.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa02">As a distinguished leader of his country for almost three decades, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah skilfully and wisely managed the political, economic and social affairs of the State of Kuwait. His vision made it possible for Kuwait to assume prominent leadership positions not only in the Arab and Islamic world, but also internationally and within the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa03">The late Amir led Kuwait through a successful era of development and growth, taking many crucial steps towards his country's modernization and the enhancement of quality of life for its citizens. During the time of crisis in the early 1990s, which we all recall, the late Amir's tireless efforts to restore Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity earned him deep admiration among the Kuwaiti people and in the world community. He will be remembered for his wisdom and for his dedicated service to his country and to the Kuwaiti people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa04">On this occasion, let us also recognize the tranquil transition of power in Kuwait and extend our best wishes to the late Amir's successor, His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, on the assumption of his high office.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa05">On behalf of the General Assembly, I ask the representative of the State of Kuwait to convey our condolences to the Government and the people of Kuwait and to the bereaved family of High Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa06">I invite representatives to stand and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa02">The late Amir cared for his people and contributed immensely to the welfare and development of the State in his successive capacities as Prime Minister, Crown Prince and ruler of the State of Kuwait. He will be remembered for his role in modernizing his country and bringing it to the forefront of international recognition. He was appreciated by many as the embodiment of unity, stability, justice and freedom, and he spared no effort whatsoever to protect the sovereignty of his State. Africa will remember him for his deep understanding of the problems of the continent, and even more for his generosity. We wish his successor well in the execution of his new responsibilities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa03">May Allah grant the late Amir eternal peace.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa02">Sheikh Jaber, as he was widely known, was a man of vision and courage who devoted his entire life to the cause of peace and development. His 28 years of tireless service and wise leadership contributed greatly to the prosperity of his country. In Kuwait, he was regarded as Baba Jaber, the father of the nation, and will be remembered in particular as a great man who was able to translate his dreams into reality for the benefit of his people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa03">His Highness Sheikh Jaber was a great statesman and a well-respected international figure. He was interested in helping people in need not only in Kuwait, but also all over the world. Kuwaitis and the international community as a whole have lost a great leader who touched and inspired the lives of millions of people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa04">I wish to convey the most sincere condolences of the members of the Asian Group to the Government and the people of Kuwait and to the family and friends of Sheikh Jaber.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa02">Designated Prime Minister in 1965 and Crown Prince in 1966, the late Amir became the ruler of Kuwait in December 1977. During his long and distinguished reign, the Amir was tireless in promoting the modernization of Kuwait, which brought well-being and prosperity to his people. Under his strong impetus, Kuwait achieved high international standing and progress was made in consolidating the country's institutions and democratization. During his reign, the State achieved prosperity and made strides towards greater political freedom, women's rights and social justice.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa03">Kuwait has lost a statesman who oversaw its development during both its most prosperous and its most difficult period. Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad will be remembered for safeguarding the Amirate's stability, independence and prosperity.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The international community has lost an outstanding leader. Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah was the ruler of Kuwait for more than 28 years, during which time he wisely guided his country towards economic prosperity, social modernization and political openness. He introduced into Kuwait's political culture progressive approaches to the development of the principle of democratic openness and of women's rights in an Islamic society.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk08-pa03">During his long reign, the late Amir lived through very difficult times, but he was able to lead the Kuwaiti people towards the recovery of their sovereignty and territorial integrity, with the support of the international community. He thereby earned the admiration and respect of the world's nations, which saw in his achievements a model of leadership within the Arab world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk08-pa04">On this sad occasion, our thoughts and prayers are with his family and with the Government and the people of Kuwait, to whom we express our warmest wishes for stability and prosperity in the future.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the United States Government, I extend my deep sympathies to the Government and the people of Kuwait on the passing of Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Sheikh Jaber was a steadfast friend of the United States. He led his country through its darkest hour, when many believed that the brutal invasion ordered by Saddam Hussein in 1990 would erase Kuwait from the world map. A close bond developed at that time between the Government and the people of Kuwait and the United States of America, and that bond continues to be just as strong today. The United States mourns with the people of Kuwait the passing of His Highness the Amir.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Throughout the difficult time following the events of August 1990, Sheikh Jaber never wavered in his faith that right would prevail; he provided hope and confidence to his people. When he returned to Kuwait after the 1991 liberation, he unified the country under the Kuwaiti Constitution and oversaw elections and the re-establishment of Kuwait's parliament. Last May, in what will no doubt be an important part of his legacy, he succeeded in leading the generation-long effort to extend full political rights to Kuwaiti women. When Kuwaiti women vote in the next parliamentary elections, it will in part be a tribute to a wise leader who understood that for a society to grow and prosper, all citizens must have a say in its governance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa04">Sheikh Jaber also understood first-hand that the threats of terrorism and dictatorship must be confronted and that national leaders need to stand together to protect civilization and government from those who would rule by fear and force. Under his leadership, relations between Kuwait and the United States grew deep and strong. Kuwait has been a vital partner in operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, and in the global campaign to combat extremism and terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The United States will miss Sheikh Jaber's leadership and friendship, but we know that his experienced successor, Sheikh Sabah, whom we know well and with whom we look forward to working in his new capacity, will uphold Sheikh Jaber's legacy and will continue to follow the example he set of dedication to his people and his country.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Ms. Al-Mulla" nation="Kuwait" language="Arabic">
	Ms. Al-Mulla (Kuwait)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I should like to thank you, Sir, the Secretary-General and all members who have conveyed their condolences to us on the passing of His Highness Sheikh Jaber, the father of all Kuwaitis and Emir of the State of Kuwait, who passed away on Sunday, 15 January.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa02">Throughout his reign of over 28 years, Kuwait went through many extraordinary experiences. Despite the many challenges to Kuwait and the crises in the region, he successfully led our country with his wise vision and policies and maintained the sovereignty, stability and security of our country. He made commendable efforts throughout his life in the service of Kuwait, leading to the country's rebirth in all areas. Throughout his reign, Kuwait enjoyed great progress in the fields of education, culture, health, the entrenchment of democracy, the observance of human rights, and international relations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa03">In 1990, he appealed to the international community from this rostrum to assert Kuwait's rights and to take the necessary steps to free it and restore its legitimacy, in accordance with the text and articles of the United Nations Charter. The international community responded by setting a precedent through the adoption of a common position, thus allowing Kuwait to regain its independence and freedom and to shake off the evil occupation. In 1991, again from this rostrum, the late Sheikh also conveyed the gratitude and thanks of the people and Government of Kuwait to States Members of the United Nations for their noble stance in defence of our people's rights and in assertion of international legitimacy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The late Sheikh worked tirelessly to entrench the values of understanding and solidarity with Arab and Islamic States and with all States of the world. In 1998, in addressing from this rostrum the issue of assistance to developing countries, he was among the first leaders to call for the partial cancellation of the debts of the least developed countries. He called on the international financial institutions to ease credit terms for the developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa05">His Highness Sheikh Jaber adopted noble positions that left their mark on the people of Kuwait. I recall with pride the honour he conferred on me in asking me to represent Kuwait as its first female ambassador, thus demonstrating his great interest in the cause of women. The international community will recall his historic decision to permit Kuwaiti women to stand for election and to vote, as they did in 2005, reflecting his interest in women's rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa06">His Highness will live forever in the hearts of his people, the Islamic and Arab world, and friendly countries. History will record his noble achievements. We ask God to be merciful to him and to reward him for his great work on behalf of his people and humankind as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Kuwait was guided by His Highness Sheikh Jaber in its progress towards cooperation with all countries in enshrining the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. His Highness proudly raised Kuwait's standard when our country joined the United Nations in 1963. Some of my colleagues will surely recall His Highness's participation at the United Nations throughout his 40-year career. International consensus and the great trust which His Highness enjoyed reflect his extraordinary ability, wisdom and experience in holding high the torch of Kuwait and in advancing its cause and working for his people.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk03-pa02">I shall now read out the solemn appeal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk03-pa03">"The ancient Greek tradition of the <i>ekecheiria</i>, or `Olympic Truce', was born in the eighth century B.C., serving as a hallowed principle of the Olympic Games. In 1992, the International Olympic Committee renewed this tradition by calling upon all nations to observe the Truce.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk03-pa04">"Through its <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-48-11">resolution 48/11</a> of 25 October 1993, the General Assembly urged Member States to observe the Olympic Truce from the seventh day before the opening to the seventh day following the closing of each Olympic Games. This appeal was renewed in the Millennium Declaration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk03-pa05">"In the 2005 World Summit Outcome, our leaders underlined that `sports can foster peace and development', and encouraged discussions in the General Assembly for proposals leading to a plan of action on sport and development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk03-pa06">"On 3 November 2005, the General Assembly held a plenary debate on the agenda item `Sport for peace and development', and also adopted, with universal support, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-8.pdf">resolution 60/8</a>, entitled `Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic Ideal'. In that resolution, the General Assembly urged Member States to observe, within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations, the Olympic Truce, individually or collectively, during the XX Olympic Winter Games, to be held in Turin, Italy, from 10 to 26 February 2006, and the subsequent Paralympic Winter Games, also to be held in Turin, from 10 to 19 March 2006, by ensuring the safe passage and participation of athletes at the Games.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk03-pa07">"The Olympic movement aspires to contribute to a peaceful future for humankind through the educational value of sport. It brings together athletes from all parts of the world in the greatest of international sports events, the Olympic Games, and it aims to promote the maintenance of peace, mutual understanding and goodwill -- goals it shares with the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk03-pa08">"As an expression of these common objectives, in 1998 the International Olympic Committee decided to fly the United Nations flag at all competition sites of the Olympic Games. The United Nations, for its part, is expanding its cooperation with the International Olympic Committee, in particular through the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk03-pa09">"As President of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly and a member of the Board of the International Truce Foundation, I solemnly appeal to all Member States to demonstrate their commitment to the Olympic Truce and to take appropriate measures to ensure a peaceful global environment for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games."</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk15-pa01">We have agreed to support the draft decision that has just been adopted. But there are a couple of questions with regard to which we would like clarification from the sponsors.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk15-pa02">The draft decision was presented as a sort of fait accompli. We understand that there are good intentions behind it and that it will contribute to the ongoing efforts at reconciliation in the country concerned. We certainly support that. But what are the legal implications for other countries? We are not very clear on that. I tried to find out from the relevant experts. Given the way the draft decision was presented and given its legal implications, I think we need some clarification from the sponsors. It would be in order for us to be provided such clarification, so that we can explain to our authorities what exactly it is that we have endorsed in the Hall.</div>

The draft decision has been adopted, but there has been a legitimate request for clarification. I shall therefore give the sponsors a moment to think about whether they want to respond spontaneously here in the Hall or whether they want to consider another way to convey their answer, through direct communication with the representative of Pakistan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa02">It appears that there is indeed an answer. But to elaborate it spontaneously in the General Assembly Hall would be a pretty heavy task. I understand from the sponsors that a reply will be forwarded to the delegation of Pakistan as soon as possible. I am sure that this will be taken care of in a bilateral fashion.</div>
