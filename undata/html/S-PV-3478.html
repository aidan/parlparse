	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1414.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1414</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 12 December 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council strongly condemns the deliberate attack on Bangladeshi United Nations peace-keepers on 12 December 1994 in Velika Kladusa, in the region of Bihac in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The attacked personnel of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were travelling in an armoured personnel carrier, unmistakably carrying clear United Nations markings. It was hit by a wire-guided anti-tank missile resulting in one death and injuries to four other Bangladeshi personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council expresses profound regret at the casualties suffered by the United Nations peace-keepers as a result of this unprovoked and dastardly attack. It wishes to convey its deep condolences to the Government of Bangladesh as well as to the families of the affected soldiers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council endorses the protest that UNPROFOR has made to the Abdic forces and to the local Serb authorities in Knin, and its warning to the authorities in Pale.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council is outraged at this incident of direct attack on UNPROFOR personnel and demands that such attacks do not recur. It warns the perpetrators of the attack that their heinous act of violence carries corresponding individual responsibility."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-79.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/79</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
