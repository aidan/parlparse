In that section, the Committee took note of the information set out in paragraphs 2 and 3.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">I now request the General Assembly to direct its attention to section II, entitled "Organization of the session", which contains a number of recommendations concerning the General Committee, rationalization of work, opening and closing dates for the session, schedule of meetings, the general debate, conduct of the meetings, et cetera. All of those recommendations concern established practice, so rather than going through them one by one, I believe it would be better and much more efficient that we address as a whole all of those organizational matters concerning the General Assembly.</p>
