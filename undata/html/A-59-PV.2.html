<p><b>The President</b>  (<i>spoke in French</i>): May I invite the General Assembly to direct its attention to section I, "Introduction", of the first report of the General Committee (<a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/250">A/59/250</a>). In that section, the Committee took note of the information set out in paragraphs 2 and 3.</p>
<p>I now request the General Assembly to direct its attention to section II, entitled "Organization of the session", which contains a number of recommendations concerning the General Committee, rationalization of work, opening and closing dates for the session, schedule of meetings, the general debate, conduct of the meetings, et cetera. All of those recommendations concern established practice, so rather than going through them one by one, I believe it would be better and much more efficient that we address as a whole all of those organizational matters concerning the General Assembly.</p>
<p>As there appear to be no comments on that approach, we shall proceed accordingly.</p>
<p>May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to take note of all of the information of which it is requested to take note and to approve all the recommendations that the General Committee has made in section II of the report?</p>

<p>With regard to paragraph 19, on waiving the requirements to declare a meeting open, I should like to endorse a practical suggestion that has been made at previous sessions: that each delegation designate someone to be present in the meeting rooms at the scheduled time.</p>
<p>Next, I invite the Assembly to turn its attention to section III of the report, entitled "Observations on the organization of the work of the General Assembly". May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to take note of the information contained in that section concerning the timely submission of draft proposals for review of their programme budget implications?</p>
