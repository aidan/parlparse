<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">Most important of all, the resolution we have unanimously adopted today responds to a request from the Government of Iraq, as set out by Prime Minister al-Jaafari in his letter of 27 October. The resolution extends for 12 months the mandate of the Multinational Force (MNF) on the terms set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1546(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1546 (2004)</a>, including the letters annexed to that resolution, as well as the arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">But as also set out by Prime Minister al-Jaafari, the resolution comes with important guarantees. The Iraqi Government will at any time be able to seek a review of the arrangements or the termination of the MNF mandate. The fact that we have been addressing Iraqi needs through this negotiation has, in the view of the United Kingdom, been quite crucial.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">As a contributor to the Multinational Force, the United Kingdom will continue to work in close partnership with the Iraqi Government, assisting its efforts to ensure that Iraqi forces assume full responsibility for security and stability in Iraq as soon as possible. Conditions permitting, we look forward to notable progress in the next year. Terrorist efforts by the insurgency, as well as spreading death, heartache and misery, will only delay the completion of the Multinational Force mandate. As the resolution underlines, such terrorism must not be allowed to disrupt Iraq's transition. We look to all United Nations Member States, Iraq's neighbours in particular, to help ensure that terrorists, their weapons and financing are kept from entering Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">The United Kingdom looks forward to the elections to a constitutionally elected Assembly, scheduled to take place on 15 December. Like other Council members, we hope all Iraqis will participate in those elections, ensuring that the next Assembly, which will take vital decisions about Iraq's future, represents the full diversity of Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">The referendum in October showed just how many Iraqi people thirst for democracy, rather than the rule of the gun. The way in which this Council has so constructively, unanimously and so rapidly adopted the resolution underlines our determination -- the determination of the international community -- to help the Iraqi people realize the vision of a stable, peaceful and democratic Iraq. With our continued support, that vision will be realized.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bolton</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">We are pleased that the Council was able to come together quickly and unanimously to respond positively to the Iraqi Government's request for continued support. The constructive dialogue that produced this text demonstrates the Security Council's strength and resolve to work towards a democratic, secure and prosperous Iraq that is for the lasting and permanent benefit of the Iraqi people.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The unanimous adoption of the resolution is a vivid demonstration of broad international support for a federal, democratic, pluralist and unified Iraq. The resolution draws heavily from <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1546(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1546 (2004)</a>, which remains the cornerstone of Security Council consensus for Iraq. It addresses those elements in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1546(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1546 (2004)</a> that expire at the end of the political transition process set out in that resolution, namely the mandate for the Multinational Force and arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Addressing those issues now will facilitate continued international support for Iraq's security and will give the newly elected Iraqi Government time to assume office, address constitutional questions and consolidate its authority before confronting issues such as those addressed in the resolution. Should it choose to do so, the new Iraqi Government could act on those matters at any time.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Most importantly, the text responds directly to the request of the Government of Iraq, as set out in the letter of Prime Minister al-Jaafari to the Security Council. It is notable that the Iraqi Mission not only joins us in the Council today, but also that it played a visible and substantial role in the negotiation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">As stated in the letter from Secretary of State Rice, substantial progress has already been made in helping to build and train the Iraqi security forces, allowing them to take on increasing security responsibilities. That said, there is still much work to be done on that front. The Multinational Force will continue to pursue that important task, as well as all other aspects of its mandate, as it works with the Iraqi Government to maintain security and stability in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">The Iraqi people continue to demonstrate the courage that we have seen throughout the transition process. They went to the polls in extraordinary numbers last month and approved a new constitution. In so doing, they offered inspiration to other countries new to democracy and to other parts of the Arab world.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">Iraq is quickly approaching another major milestone in its transition. There will be a new election on 15 December. It is important that this be a transparent, participatory and inclusive process for all Iraqi communities. We welcome the efforts of the Iraqis, the United Nations and other members of the international community that enable all Iraqis to participate in the political process.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">We urge the international community, especially the Arab world, to come forward and support the Iraqi people. That support comes in many forms -- participation in the Coalition, contribution to Iraq's humanitarian and reconstruction activities, increased diplomatic engagement and compliance with relevant resolutions. Support is critical at this time. Such support helps to consolidate Iraq's democratic progress, consistent with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1546(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1546 (2004)</a>, and demonstrates solidarity with the Iraqi people in the face of terror.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dumitru</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">In joining our Multinational Force (MNF) partners in sponsoring the resolution, Romania had in view, first of all, the letter received by the President of the Security Council from the Iraqi Government, requesting the extension of the mandates of the MNF, the International Advisory and Monitoring Board and the Development Fund for Iraq, as provided in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1546(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1546 (2004)</a>. We believe that the Council ought to rally to that request and articulate its response with the same understanding of timing and effectiveness. Extending those mandates now will allow the Iraqis to focus on preparing for what is the most important step yet in their political transition.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">We very much welcome the constructive work by the members of the Council during the negotiations on the draft resolution, which enabled the unanimous adoption of the text. The final text is well balanced and is an appropriate response to the specific requests of the Iraqi Government.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">I wish to conclude by stating, in a nutshell, that Romania has repeatedly affirmed her support for the actions of the Iraqi Government to ensure durable stability, an effective reconstruction process and a democratic transition process. Romania will remain engaged in Iraq for as along as our presence and assistance are needed by the Iraqi people and Government.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haneda</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">Japan welcomes the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1637(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1637 (2005)</a>. The nature of this resolution is primarily technical, aimed at extending the mandates of the multinational force and of the Development Fund for Iraq and its International Advisory and Monitoring Board. However, the Iraqi side, in anticipation of the imminent start of the election campaign, had requested early adoption of this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">Also, for countries contributing troops to the multinational force, including my country, it was vitally important to gain a stable perspective on the troop contribution framework through the early adoption of this resolution. The text of the draft resolution prepared by the United States and the United Kingdom has been amplified significantly with a full complement of political messages. Considering the importance of the draft resolution, Japan decided to join in sponsoring it.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">We hope that the unanimous adoption of this resolution will send the right message to the Iraqi public, the international community and the citizenry of each troop-contributing country regarding the necessity of a continued presence of the multinational force.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Faaborg-Andersen</span> <span class="nation">Denmark</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">The Iraqi Government asked the Security Council to extend the mandate of the multinational force for a period of 12 months, starting 31 December of this year; that request of the Iraqi Government deserved, in our view, to be met. Denmark was thus happy to sponsor the draft resolution and warmly welcomes its unanimous adoption. It demonstrates the support and the commitment of the international community to the Iraqi people's endeavour to create a democratic and prosperous Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">In the face of serious challenges, the Iraqi people have reached significant milestones in achieving that goal. The successful elections in January, as well as the referendum on the draft constitution in October, demonstrated the willingness of the Iraqi people to participate in the democratic process. A process of national reconciliation is beginning to take shape, and an increasing number of Iraqis from all segments of society are taking part in the political process. We hope that the outcome of the December elections will further consolidate this trend.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Many leaders of the former regime, including Saddam Hussein himself, are now being held accountable for their actions. The establishment of a well-functioning legal system will go a very long way towards re-establishing the trust of the people of Iraq in their Government and their justice system.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Denmark will continue to do its share to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful, democratic and prosperous Iraq. Five hundred and thirty Danish soldiers are currently serving on Iraqi soil as part of the multinational force. We stand by our commitment to contribute to the national security of Iraq, as requested by the Iraqi Government.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">At the same time, we look forward to the day in the not-too-distant future when Iraqi forces will assume full responsibility for the maintenance of stability and security in their country. Strengthening the education and training of Iraqi security and police forces is central to building a sustainable Iraqi capability to ensure a stable and secure Iraq. To this end, Denmark is a major contributor to training and assistance in the security field.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Like others around the table, Denmark stands ready to do its share in creating a prosperous Iraq with a competitive economy and a vibrant civil society. Denmark will thus continue to provide assistance in the areas of democratization, justice and the rule of law, as well as in other areas. Moreover, humanitarian assistance will be needed in some areas.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Finally, in spite of the impressive progress, serious challenges remain before the goal of a stable, prosperous and fully democratic Iraq is achieved. We remain worried about the security situation, which is slowing down progress in all other areas. In spite of the volatile security environment, we urge the Iraqi Government to do its utmost to ensure full respect for human rights by all Iraqi authorities, including the Iraqi security forces and the Iraqi police.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Times have changed, and Saddam Hussein and his oppressive regime are things of the past. Much progress has been made. We for our part stand ready to help meet the challenges that remain.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Duclos</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">France voted in favour of the resolution that the Security Council has just adopted unanimously. We participated in the discussions prior to the adoption in a spirit of consensus. I would like to make some specific remarks with respect to our approach.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Our first concern was to respond to the official request made by the Transitional Government of Iraq. The Government had asked for a 12-month extension for the mandate of the multinational force in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Our second objective was to send to the people of Iraq a message of support for the sovereignty of Iraq. We wished on the one hand to encourage pursuit of the political process towards national harmony and, on the other, to recall that the presence of foreign forces in Iraq is occurring within this framework and that those forces must maintain their temporary status.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Our third priority was to recall the crucial role of the United Nations in the political and economic transition in Iraq beyond 31 December 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">In our view, the resolution that we have adopted meets those concerns. The Security Council, in response to the letter from the Prime Minister of Iraq (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-687.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/687</a>, annex), has extended for 12 months the mandate of the multilateral force and the arrangements related to the operation of the Development Fund for Iraq and the activities of the International Advisory and Monitoring Board.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">At the same time, that decision is accompanied by a number of other provisions. I should like to recall the major ones. First of all, the Council emphasizes the importance of pursuing the political process beyond the elections of 15 December and the establishment of a sovereign Government. The Security Council, in this resolution, calls on the future Government to promote truly inclusive political dialogue with a view to national reconciliation, including by engaging with all those who renounce violence. These are significant challenges, but meeting them is essential for the future of an Iraq which will be stable, united and democratic. The international community must, naturally, provide its full support to Iraq on this path. In that regard, France welcomes the prospects of an Iraqi national conference organized with the assistance of countries in the region to promote the integration of all Iraqi groups and communities into the political process.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Secondly, it goes without saying that the Security Council does not prejudge decisions to be taken by the next Government regarding the mandate of the multinational force. The future Government may at any time request that the mandate be revised or ended. The mandate is limited in duration; barring a contrary decision of the Council, it will expire on 31 December 2006. Moreover, the Security Council has included a meeting clause. The mandate will be reviewed no later than 15 June 2006. Until then, the multinational and the Iraqi forces must act in compliance with international law.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">Thirdly, the Council reaffirms in the resolution that the United Nations must continue to play a lead role in the political and economic transition process through the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">Overall, the Security Council today has assumed its share of responsibility, bearing in mind the requests made by the Transitional Government of Iraq and acting in a manner consistent with the logic that has guided its actions vis-à-vis Iraq for the past two years and that seeks to ensure the effective exercise by that country of its full sovereignty. France will continue to support the people of Iraq on the path of national reconciliation, democracy and reconstruction. That is the meaning behind today's vote.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of the Russian Federation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">I wish first to thank the sponsors of today's resolution. We studied it carefully and suggested certain amendments to make the document more relevant to contemporary realities in Iraq. Some of our proposals are reflected in the text. We welcome the outcome of the involved consultations on the document, which reflects the great complexity of the situation in Iraq. It was important that the document reflect the basic principles of an Iraqi settlement: respect for the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the necessity of holding a national dialogue aimed at achieving reconciliation among all sectors of Iraqi society.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">The resolution will allow the Iraqi security forces to assume full responsibility for maintaining long-term stability and security in the country, permitting the multinational force to fulfil its mandate and fully to withdraw from Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq has its work cut out for it. It must, in the near future, resolve the significant challenges of organizing the elections and promoting mutual understanding among the various factions of Iraqi society. We and the sponsors made concessions in the drafting of the resolution. On the Russian side in particular, we felt it necessary to include a reference to the need to convene a new international meeting on Iraq. Bearing in mind the appeal from the Iraqi side that the resolution not address that issue, as well as the ongoing consultations between Baghdad and the League of Arab States on the organization of an inter-Iraqi conference under the League's auspices, we thought it expedient not to insist on including in the resolution a provision on international follow-up to the Iraqi political process.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">At the same time, we are convinced that significant international input will be necessary in the next phase to complete the process in Iraq, as it will facilitate the promotion of the inter-Iraqi dialogue to achieve national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">In conclusion, I would note that Russia stresses the importance of a constructive atmosphere, including here in the Security Council, to the success of an Iraqi settlement. On the basis of such considerations, we were able to support the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>

I would like to thank each member of the Security Council for their positive contribution and the spirit in which the preparations for the resolution took place.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">We note with satisfaction the manner in which the resolution was adopted in an environment of harmony and agreement on the principles laid out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1546(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1546 (2004)</a>, which set down the foundation for the political process in Iraq. We pledge the continued adherence of the Iraqi Government to the political process prescribed by the Council. Iraq has fulfilled its obligations at every stage in the transitional process and we look forward now to country-wide elections on 15 December under a Constitution that was approved by the great majority of the Iraqi people.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">It is very important for the international community that this process be successful. Failure would be too awful to contemplate and would represent a threat to regional and international peace. The Iraqi people are in no way contemplating failure. They are determined, and they will go forward with the process.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">With such clear and unequivocal support from the international community for the political transition, we will go forward with redoubled effort and confidence to complete our journey towards peace and prosperity in Iraq and to defeat terrorism in our country.</p>
