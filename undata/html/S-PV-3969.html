	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>

<div class="italicline-spokein" id="pg002-bk08">
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01"><i>spoke in English</i></p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk09">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">"The Security Council expresses its alarm at the serious deterioration in the political and military situation in Angola. It reaffirms its belief that lasting peace and national reconciliation cannot be achieved through military means, and urges the Government of Angola and especially the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to resume a constructive dialogue on the basis of the "Acordos de Paz" (<a href="../pdf/S-22609.pdf" class="nolink">S/22609</a>, annex), the Lusaka Protocol (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1441.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1441</a>, annex) and relevant Security Council resolutions in order to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict and spare the Angolan people further war and suffering. In this context, it reaffirms that the primary cause of the crisis in Angola is the refusal by UNITA to comply with the basic provisions of the Lusaka Protocol and reiterates its demand that UNITA comply with its obligations to demilitarize and to permit the extension of State administration to territories it controls.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">"The Security Council shares the assessment and judgments of the Secretary-General on the political and military situation in Angola contained in his report of 17 January 1999 (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-49.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/49</a>). It underscores the contribution of the United Nations to the past four years of relative peace in Angola. It expresses its deep regret that the present political and security situation in the country and the lack of cooperation, especially by UNITA, with the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) have prevented MONUA from fully carrying out its mandated role.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council underlines the great importance it attaches to a continued multidisciplinary presence of the United Nations under the direction of a Representative of the Secretary-General in Angola. It recognizes that such a continued presence depends on the safety of United Nations personnel and requires the agreement of the Government of Angola and the cooperation of all concerned. In this context, it appeals to the Government of Angola to provide such agreement and to UNITA to cooperate fully. It welcomes the intention of the Secretary-General to consult urgently with the Government of Angola on such a United Nations presence and to report to the Council in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council again calls upon Member States to support the peace process in Angola through full and immediate implementation of the measures against UNITA contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 864 (1993)</a> of 15 September 1993, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1127(1997).pdf" class="pdf">1127 (1997)</a> of 28 August 1997 and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1173(1998).pdf" class="pdf">1173 (1998)</a> of 12 June 1998, and reiterates its readiness to take steps to reinforce the implementation of these measures on the basis of the recommendations contained in section IV of the report of the Secretary-General of 17 January 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its profound concern at the humanitarian impact of the conflict on the Angolan people. It urges the international community to support the Government of Angola in fulfilling its primary responsibility for the humanitarian needs of the Angolan people and, in this regard, urges Member States to fund generously the 1999 Consolidated Humanitarian Appeal for Angola. It calls upon all concerned to concur and cooperate with United Nations humanitarian assistance activities on the basis of the principles of neutrality and non-discrimination, to guarantee the security and freedom of movement of humanitarian personnel, and to ensure necessary, adequate and safe access and logistics by land and air. It urges all concerned to cooperate with the human rights activities of the United Nations, which help to lay a basis for lasting peace and national reconciliation.</p>
