	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the recent mission by the Secretary-General's Special Adviser to Myanmar, Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, reaffirms its strong and unwavering support for the Secretary-General's good offices mission as mandated by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-232.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 61/232</a>, and expresses its appreciation for the personal engagement of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council strongly deplores the use of violence against peaceful demonstrations in Myanmar and welcomes Human Rights Council <a href="../pdf/A-RES-S-5-1.pdf" class="nolink">resolution S-5/1</a> of 2 October 2007. The Security Council emphasizes the importance of the early release of all political prisoners and remaining detainees. It also calls on the Government of Myanmar and all other parties concerned to work together towards a de-escalation of the situation and a peaceful solution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council stresses the need for the Government of Myanmar to create the necessary conditions for a genuine dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all concerned parties and ethnic groups in order to achieve an inclusive national reconciliation, with the direct support of the United Nations. The Security Council encourages the Government of Myanmar to consider seriously Mr. Gambari's recommendations and proposals. The Security Council also calls on the Government of Myanmar to take all necessary measures to address the political, economic, humanitarian and human rights issues that are the concern of its people and emphasizes that the future of Myanmar lies in the hands of all of its people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the Government of Myanmar's public commitment to work with the United Nations and the appointment of a liaison officer with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The Security Council stresses the importance that such commitments be followed by action. It acknowledges that the Government of Myanmar had invited Mr. Gambari to Myanmar. It underscores its support for his return as early as possible in order to facilitate concrete actions and tangible results. The Security Council urges the Government of Myanmar and all parties concerned to cooperate fully with Mr. Gambari.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the important role played by the ASEAN countries in urging restraint, calling for a peaceful transition to democracy, and supporting the good offices mission. It notes that the good offices mission is a process, and encourages the sustained support and engagement of the international community in helping Myanmar.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council remains seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-37.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/37</a>.</p>
