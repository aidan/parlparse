	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa11">In accordance with paragraph 16 of annex VI to the rules of procedure, the election of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly by secret ballot will be dispensed with when the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled. We shall proceed accordingly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa12">I shall now read out the names of the endorsed candidates:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa13">African States: Algeria, Congo, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Namibia</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa02">As members are aware, the Assembly, in paragraph 7 of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-40-243">resolution 40/243</a>, decided that no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly should be permitted to meet at United Nations Headquarters during a regular session of the Assembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa03">As indicated in the letter I have just mentioned, the Committee on Conferences has recommended that the General Assembly authorize the Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which has been meeting from 18 August 1995, to meet until 22 September 1995.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa04">In view of the fact that this date overlaps with the fiftieth session of the Assembly, may I take it that the General Assembly adopts the recommendation of the Committee on Conferences?</div>
