	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the signing of the Framework Agreement in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by President Trajkovski and the leaders of four political parties on 13 August 2001. The Council calls for the full and immediate implementation of the Agreement, which promotes the peaceful and harmonious development of civil society while respecting the ethnic identity and the interests of all Macedonian citizens.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Council calls for the full implementation of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1345(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1345 (2001)</a> and reaffirms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Council calls again on all those concerned, including on leaders of ethnic Albanian communities in the region, publicly to condemn violence and ethnic intolerance and to use their influence to secure peace. It reiterates its call to all who have contact with extremist groups to make clear to them that they have no support from any quarter in the international community. The Council condemns the ongoing violence by extremists and calls on all parties to respect the ceasefire. The Council rejects any attempt to use violence, including the use of landmines, to undermine the Framework Agreement, which has been negotiated by the democratically elected political leadership of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council supports the actions of the President and Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia aimed at resolving the crisis and assuring a stable and democratic future for all of the citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, including through continued dialogue with the full representation of all legitimate political parties to strengthen democracy and preserve the multi-ethnic character of Macedonian society and the stability of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the efforts of the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in support of the Framework Agreement. It also calls on the international community to consider how best to assist the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in facilitating its full implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council will continue to follow closely developments on the ground."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-20.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/20</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
