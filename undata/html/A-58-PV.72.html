To that end, the Ad Hoc Committee would be requested to formulate a preamble and final clauses, based on previously agreed results, and to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on the outcome of its work.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and we hope that the General Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to agenda item 151, "Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its thirty-sixth session". The report of the Sixth Committee on this agenda item is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-513.pdf">A/58/513</a>. The Sixth Committee recommends that the General Assembly adopt the two draft resolutions contained in paragraph 9 of that document.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the first draft resolution entitled "Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its thirty-sixth session", the General Assembly would, among others things, request the Commission and its secretariat to take the lead in assuring cooperation and coordination with other relevant international organizations in work on international legal texts. In addition, it would request the Secretary-General to keep under review the level of resources available to the Commission in order to ensure its ability to carry out its mandate. It would also appeal to Governments, the relevant bodies of the United Nations system, organizations, institutions and individuals to support the training and legislative technical assistance programme of the Commission, in particular in developing countries, and to make voluntary contributions to the relevant trust funds.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the operative paragraphs of the second draft resolution, entitled "Model Legislative Provisions on Privately Financed Infrastructure Projects of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law", the General Assembly would express its appreciation to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law for its adoption of the Model Legislative Provisions, would request the Secretary-General to publish them and would recommend that all States give due consideration to the Model Legislative Provisions and the Legislative Guide on the same subject, adopted by the Commission in 2000, when revising or adopting their relevant legislation.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and we hope that the General Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I would now like to draw the Assembly's attention to the Sixth Committee's report on agenda item 152, "Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-fifth session", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-514.pdf">A/58/514</a>. The draft resolution recommended for adoption by the General Assembly appears in paragraph 8 of that report.</div>
	<div class="p">By the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would, among other things, take note with appreciation of the report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-fifth session and recommend that the Commission continue its work on the topics in its current programme, taking into account comments and observations of Governments.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly would reiterate the invitation to Governments to provide information regarding State practice on the topic "Unilateral acts of States" and would invite Governments to submit information regarding national legislation, bilateral and other agreements and arrangements with regard to the use and management of transboundary groundwaters, in particular those governing quality and quantity of such waters, relevant to the topic currently entitled "Shared natural resources". The Assembly would also request the Secretary-General to invite States and international organizations to submit information concerning their practice relevant to the topic "Responsibility of international organizations", including cases in which States members of an international organization may be regarded as responsible for acts of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly would also invite the Commission to continue taking measures to enhance its efficiency and productivity and would encourage the Commission to continue taking cost-saving measures at it future sessions. Furthermore, it would approve the conclusions of the Commission regarding documentation of the Commission.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, the General Assembly would decide that the next session of the Commission would be held at the United Nations Office at Geneva from 3 May to 4 June and from 5 July to 6 August 2004.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and we hope that the General Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me now turn to the Sixth Committee's report on agenda item 153, "Report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-515.pdf">A/58/515</a>. The draft resolution recommended to the Assembly for adoption is set out in paragraph 8 of that report.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, inter alia, endorse the recommendations and conclusions of the Host Country Committee, express the view that the maintenance of appropriate conditions for the normal work of delegations and the missions accredited to the United Nations and the observance of their privileges and immunities is an issue of great importance, and request the host country to continue to resolve, through negotiations, problems that might arise and to take all measures necessary to prevent any interference with the functioning of missions.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would welcome the decision of the Committee to conduct a detailed review of the implementation of the Parking Programme for Diplomatic Vehicles, as recommended by the Legal Counsel in his legal opinion on 24 September 2002, with a view to addressing the problems experienced by some Missions during the first year of the Parking Programme, and ensuring its proper implementation in a manner that is fair, non-discriminatory, effective and consistent with international law. It would express its appreciation for the efforts made by the host country and its hope that the issues raised at the meetings of the Host Country Committee would continue to be resolved in a spirit of cooperation and in accordance with international law. Moreover, it would note that during the reporting period the travel controls previously imposed by the host country on staff of certain missions, and staff members of the Secretariat of certain nationalities, remained in effect and would request the host country to consider removing such travel controls.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would also note that the Committee anticipates that the host country will continue to ensure the timely issuance of entry visas to representatives of Member States for the purpose of their attending official United Nations meetings, in accordance with applicable agreements.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and we hope that the General Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to the Sixth Committee's report on agenda item 154, entitled "International Criminal Court", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-516.pdf">A/58/516</a>. The draft resolution recommended for adoption by the General Assembly is found in paragraph 8 of that report.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would, inter alia, call upon all States that have signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to ratify or accede to that agreement without delay and would encourage efforts aimed at promoting the results of the Rome Conference and the provisions of the Rome Statute.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would also welcome the establishment of the Permanent Secretariat for the Assembly of States Parties and, in that context, would recognize the need for an orderly and smooth transition of that function from the United Nations Secretariat to the new body. In addition, the Assembly would express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for providing effective and efficient assistance in the establishment of the Court and would also invite him to take measures to conclude a relationship agreement between the United Nations and the Court.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and we hope that the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now draw the Assembly's attention to the Sixth Committee's report on agenda item 155, "Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-517.pdf">A/58/517</a>. The Sixth Committee recommends that the General Assembly adopt two draft resolutions contained in paragraph 12 of that report.</div>
	<div class="p">By the terms of draft resolution I, entitled "Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization", the General Assembly would, inter alia, request the Special Committee, at its next session, from 29 March to 8 April 2004, to continue its consideration of all proposals concerning the question of the maintenance of international peace and security in all its aspects in order to strengthen the role of the United Nations. The Special Committee would also be requested to continue to consider, on a priority basis, the question of the implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter, by commencing a substantive debate on all of the related reports of the Secretary-General and the proposals submitted on the question.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would encourage the Secretary-General in his efforts to eliminate the backlog in the <i>Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs</i> and in the <i>Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council</i> and request that he submit a report on both publications to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.</div>
	<div class="p">By the provisions of draft resolution II, entitled "Implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions", the General Assembly would, inter alia, decide to consider at its fifty-ninth session -- either within the Sixth Committee or a working group of that Committee -- further progress in the elaboration of effective measures to implement the provisions of the Charter related to assistance to third States affected by sanctions.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the two draft resolutions without a vote and we hope that the Assembly will wish to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to the report of the Sixth Committee on agenda item 156, "Measures to eliminate international terrorism", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-518.pdf">A/58/518</a>. The draft resolution recommended for adoption by the General Assembly is set out in paragraph 10 of that report.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, inter alia, strongly condemn all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, wherever and by whomsoever committed. In addition, the Assembly would urge States that have not yet done so to consider, as a matter of priority and in accordance with Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, becoming parties to the relevant conventions and protocols in that area. The draft resolution would urge States to work in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with one another, as well as with interested intergovernmental organizations, to ensure, where appropriate within existing mandates, that technical and other expert advice is provided to States requiring and requesting assistance to enable them to become parties to the conventions and protocols in question.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would decide that the Ad Hoc Committee, established pursuant to <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a> of 17 December 1996, would continue to elaborate a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism, as a matter of urgency, and would continue its efforts to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the elaboration of a draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. The Ad Hoc Committee would also keep on its agenda the question of convening a high-level conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, to formulate a joint organized response of the international community to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would further decide that the Ad Hoc Committee will meet from 28 June to 2 July 2004 and would continue their work, if necessary, during the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, within the framework of a working group of the Sixth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and we hope that the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I would now like to turn to the report of the Sixth Committee on agenda item 157, "Scope of legal protection under the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-519.pdf">A/58/519</a>. The draft resolution recommended by the Sixth Committee for adoption by the General Assembly is set out in paragraph 10 of that report.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would, among other things, urge States to take all necessary measures, in accordance with their international obligations, to prevent the commission of crimes against United Nations and associated personnel, and to ensure that those crimes do not go unpunished and that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.</div>
	<div class="p">According to operative paragraph 11, the next meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-89.pdf">resolution 56/89</a> would be held from 12 to 16 April 2004. The Ad Hoc Committee's mandate, as set out in that paragraph, would be to expand the scope of legal protection under the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, including, inter alia, by means of a legal instrument, and that the work shall continue during the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly within the working group of the Sixth Committee. By operative paragraph 12, the Ad Hoc Committee would be requested to submit a report on its work to the General Assembly at the fifty-ninth session. Finally, in operative paragraph 13, the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on the measures taken to implement the resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and we hope that the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now draw the Assembly's attention to the Sixth Committee's report on agenda item 158, entitled "International convention against the reproductive cloning of human beings", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-520.pdf">A/58/520</a>. The Sixth Committee's recommendation to the General Assembly can be found in paragraph 14 of that report. As described in paragraph 10, the Sixth Committee adopted a motion, under rule 116 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, to adjourn the debate on the agenda item until the sixtieth session of the General Assembly. Therefore, as noted in paragraph 13, the Committee did not take action on any other proposals.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee recommends that the item entitled "International convention against the reproductive cloning of human beings" be included in the provisional agenda of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="p">My delegation felt it appropriate to maintain consensus on the adoption of the draft resolution contained in document A/C.6/58/L.23, under agenda item 153, "Report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country", and with regard to the report of the Sixth Committee contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-515.pdf">A/58/515</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">However, we do wish to indicate that the host country continues to repeatedly fail to comply with its obligations under the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and the agreement concluded between the United Nations and the United States of America concerning the Headquarters of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation states this on the basis of concrete examples which occurred recently, such as the arbitrary failure to grant travel permits requested for His Excellency Mr. Dagoberto Rodriguez Barrera, head of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, to attend the fifty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations as a member of the Cuban delegation.</div>
	<div class="p">More recently, in November, there was the late issuance of travel permits to two officials of our Mission who were to travel to Washington to participate in the meeting of the Council of the Global Environment Facility, scheduled for 19 to 21 November 2003. Although the travel permit in question was requested within the time limits established, as stipulated by the discriminatory practices imposed by the host country against the Cuban Mission to the United Nations, this delay meant that the Cuban delegation was unable to be present at that meeting during the first day of the session. To date, we have not been informed of the reasons.</div>
	<div class="p">That unjustified delay comes in addition to the fact that entry visas to the United States were not issued to the remainder of the Cuban delegation, which was to travel from Havana to participate in that event. Despite the fact that Cuba currently occupies the position of member of the Council of the Global Environment Facility for the Caribbean area and presides over the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which agreed at its sixth meeting in Havana, from 25 August to 5 September 2003, to accept the Global Environment Facility as the financial mechanism of the Convention.</div>
	<div class="p">We wish to reiterate that in our capacity as a member of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country, we will continue to contribute to refining the work of that Committee through broad-based processes of debate, consultation and negotiation among its members and the active participation of other States. However, we cannot fail to denounce the selective, unjust, discriminatory and politically motivated practices by the host country, which constitute flagrant violations of the Headquarters Agreement and the customary rules of diplomatic law.</div>

</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The United Kingdom is profoundly disappointed by the actions of those who sought, until very recently, to overturn the decision of the Sixth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">During the deliberations of the Sixth Committee, we made clear the views of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is totally opposed to reproductive cloning, and we were one of the first countries in the world to introduce specific legislation to ban that possibility.</div>
	<div class="p">However, in our view, therapeutic cloning is a different matter. The United Kingdom believes that all types of stem cell research, including therapeutic cloning, should be encouraged. Indeed, we believe that it would be indefensible to stop such research and deny millions of people -- and their families -- the chance of new treatments that could save their lives. The international scientific community supports that view. More than 60 of the world's leading scientific academies, including the United States National Academy of Sciences, published a joint statement in September 2003 calling on the United Nations to ban reproductive cloning -- but to permit therapeutic cloning research.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Kingdom respects the cultural, religious and social differences that may lead other countries to reach different conclusions on what type of research may be appropriate in their own national settings. We have no wish to impose our view on other countries or to interfere in decisions that have been legitimately taken by other national Governments. We believe that it would be totally unjustifiable to attempt to impose a ban on therapeutic cloning in those countries that have reached a national consensus in favour of such research, that have nationally agreed regulatory systems for embryo research, and that are working to deliver new treatments for serious and life-threatening diseases.</div>
	<div class="p">I have already expressed our disappointment at the present situation. We believe that the United Nations should proceed through consensus. It is clear that there is no consensus with respect to therapeutic cloning research. But, by ignoring that fact and pressing for action to ban all cloning, supporters of the Costa Rican draft resolution have effectively destroyed the possibility of action on the important area on which we are all agreed -- a ban on reproductive cloning.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to make clear that the United Kingdom would never be party to any convention that aimed to introduce a global ban on therapeutic cloning; neither will the United Kingdom participate in the drafting of such a convention or apply it in its national law. Therapeutic cloning research will continue to be permitted in the United Kingdom.</div>

	<div class="p">The delegation of Egypt joined the consensus of the General Assembly in its consideration of agenda item 158. Nevertheless, we should like to place on record the following two points.</div>
	<div class="p">First, the Egyptian delegation expresses its dissatisfaction at the precedent of the Assembly reconsidering in plenary meeting issues already discussed by the Sixth Committee and altering -- even dropping -- recommendations made in the Committee's report. We are fully aware that the plenary has the right to take any action it deems appropriate with regard to any recommendation made by any of the Main Committees. At the same time, however, I should like to express our concern at the possible repercussions of that precedent on the Committees' future actions and on the Assembly's relationship with its Committees.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, because the General Committee recommended referral of item 158 to the Sixth Committee, instead of recommending referral to the Assembly in plenary meeting, it is not procedurally permissible to submit any documents under the item to the plenary for consideration. Here, we should like to recall the consideration of agenda item 108, which was referred to both the Third Committee and the plenary. If the General Assembly had wished to grant jurisdiction to both plenary meetings and the Sixth Committee to consider item 158, then it would have done so, as was the case with item 108. Therefore, we have procedural doubts about the soundness of presenting document <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.37.pdf">A/58/L.37</a>.</div>

	Mr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On behalf of the Member States of the Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC) -- the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tajikistan -- I would like to express our deep gratitude to the General Assembly for supporting the recommendation of the Sixth Committee on granting observer status to the EAEC in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The Member States of the EAEC are grateful to those countries that have joined in sponsoring the resolution and in particular, Cambodia and Ukraine. One of them, Ukraine, has the status of observer in the EAEC. We see this decision by the General Assembly as proof that the international community has high regard for the work that is being conducted by our States in meeting the objectives and the challenges entailed in enhancing integration processes on Eurasian territory.</div>
	<div class="p">We also believe that this type of mechanism for cooperation, one such as the EAEC, is crucial in order for our common interests in the Eurasian region to be correctly presented at the international level. The major purposes of the Community are clearly articulated in the founding treaty of our organization and are in every way consonant with the purposes of the United Nations. The work of this regional intergovernmental organization includes a wide range of issues and encompasses economics, finance, trade, transport, energy, the environment and cooperation for development.</div>
	<div class="p">We are convinced that the work of the EAEC, as an organization that brings together States with enormous trade and transport potential, could become a significant factor in the ongoing post-Doha and post-Monterrey transformation of international trade and development policy. This experience and innovations which our countries are requiring as they transform their area into a free-trade zone through EAEC could, in our view, be appropriately implemented in the resumed post-Cancún negotiating process. The participation of the EAEC in the work of the General Assembly as an observer will help us establish closer cooperation between the EAEC and the United Nations so that we can achieve our common purposes in the area of socio-economic development. It will also help us establish new and more appropriate opportunities for expanding the field of cooperation between our two organizations.</div>
	<div class="p">The universal and comprehensive nature of the work of the United Nations, its tremendous intellectual and technological potential, puts it in a position to provide policy and technical support to the efforts of economic organizations such as the EAEC. This support from the United Nations would be an effective contributor to the successful development of the economies of our States in a time of rapidly changing global economic and trade processes.</div>
	<div class="p">The EAEC's involvement, as well as the involvement of other major inter-State economic associations in crafting high-level socio-economic policy decisions at the United Nations, is a positive step in light of the Secretary-General's report to the Millennium Summit with its recommendations to ensure closer coordination of macroeconomic and trade policy so as to help us achieve our common purpose, namely to increase the advantages of globalization.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I would once again like to thank the delegations for adopting this decision, and note the desire of our States to give solid substance to the EAEC's involvement as an observer in the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="p">The Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC) is a regional organization, and its emergence logically stems from the high rate at which economic transformation is taking place in member States. The Community fulfils our need for regional and subregional organizations in today's world as a strong voice in helping to resolve political and socio-economic problems. One of the major purposes of our organization is set forward in its unified economic space.</div>
	<div class="p">We are moving forward towards that goal. Recently, we have been able to achieve genuine results in integrating our work, for example, by creating a free-trade zone on the territory of the Community. We have also adopted a number of legal measures aimed at harmonizing foreign trade, including fiscal, customs and currency legislation among our States. Legislation has also been enacted on cross-border issues, energy, transportation and social questions. The problem of migration is now very urgent for all our States. Within our organization we have a draft agreement on principles for regulating labour migration, and, if adopted, it will eliminate many problems that have to do with illegal migration.</div>
	<div class="p">We are also paying a great deal of attention to resolving ecological problems. A major priority of our work is the area of social issues, which is particularly important for the Central Asian States, where providing employment, medical services and education, in addition to overcoming poverty, are pressing problems.</div>
	<div class="p">Generally, in spite of its relative youth, our organization is already playing a significant role in encouraging and expanding the integration of Member States into the global economy and the international division of labour.</div>
	<div class="p">As Secretary General of the EAEC, I wish to thank members for adopting this resolution today on granting observer status for the Community in the General Assembly. For us it is not just a formal act, it represents the conclusion of a process of international and legal recognition of our organization as a full-fledged participant in international economic integration. This new status, no doubt, will allow the EAEC to strengthen and improve its potential and will help us broaden the frameworks of our international cooperation. We are prepared to work very closely with the United Nations, as well as with all other international partners who are interested in working with us.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I would like to pledge to members that the EAEC will do its utmost to cooperate with the United Nations so that we can meet all our challenges and strengthen and support international peace and security by ensuring sustainable social economic developments in the Eurasian region.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It is a great honour for me to inform the General Assembly of our pride, Sir, in having you personally as President of the Assembly. I know how dear to you and close to your heart this item is. It is no secret that the issue of decolonization enjoyed broader support and assistance during your chairmanship of the Committee of 24 some years ago. I thank you for that commitment, which is ongoing through all of us.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly is beginning its consideration of agenda item 19 on the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. As the Rapporteur of the Special Committee on decolonization, I have the honour to present the report of the Committee on its activities during the year 2003.</div>
	<div class="p">The report is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-58-23">A/58/23</a> and consists of three parts.</div>
	<div class="p">Part I of the report provides information on the history and organization of the Committee and gives a general description of the matters on its agenda and its interaction with other United Nations bodies and intergovernmental, non-governmental and regional organizations. A review of the work of the Committee during the year 2003 can also be found in Part I of the report.</div>
	<div class="p">Projections for the future work of the Committee in the year 2004, subject to the approval of the General Assembly, are contained in section J of part I. I would like to draw the Assembly's particular attention to that section of the report.</div>
	<div class="p">Part II of the report contains information on the activities of the Committee according to the items on its agenda. It gives an account of the Special Committee's deliberations on such issues as the dissemination of information on decolonization; the question of sending visiting missions to the Territories; economic and other activities that affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories; the implementation of the Declaration by the specialized agencies and international institutions; and information transmitted under Article 73 <i>e</i> of the United Nations Charter. That part of the report also presents a brief summary of the Special Committee's deliberations related to the 16 remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories.</div>
	<div class="p">Part III of the report contains the recommendations of the Committee in the form of draft resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p">The year under review was a productive year for the Special Committee on decolonization. For the first time in history, the Committee held its seminar in a Non-Self-Governing Territory, Anguilla, for which we are thankful both to the Government of the United Kingdom and to the Government of the Territory of Anguilla.</div>
	<div class="p">In 2003, the Special Committee continued to be guided by the goals set up for the Second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism and its plan of action. The Committee concentrated its efforts on those actions that need to be taken by the administering Powers, by the Territories and by the Committee itself in order to implement the objectives of the Decade and to move forward towards a complete eradication of colonialism.</div>
	<div class="p">The report states that the Committee has focused its attention on political, economic and social developments in the Non-Self-Governing Territories. In that respect, the Committee attaches great importance to the participation of representatives from the Territories, as well as non-governmental organizations and experts, in its annual session in June 2003.</div>
	<div class="p">The report underlines that the Special Committee continues to pay special attention to developing productive relationships with the administering Powers. To that end, the Committee has undertaken further efforts to intensify dialogue and improve interaction with them. The report notes the continuation of fruitful meetings of the representatives of New Zealand and Tokelau and confirms the readiness of the United Nations Development Programme to finance a study on the self-determination options for that Territory.</div>
	<div class="p">The report also notes that the United Kingdom and the United States have continued their informal contacts with the Special Committee and that both administering Powers have expressed their intention to maintain those contacts in the future. The participation of the representatives of the United Kingdom in the seminar in Anguilla considerably enriched that forum. In 2004, the Special Committee intends to continue to seek closer cooperation with all administering Powers and hopes to enjoy their formal participation in its work.</div>
	<div class="p">The annex to chapter II of part I of the report contains information on the Caribbean Regional Seminar, which was held in the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Anguilla in May 2003. In addition to the novelty of being held in a Non-Self-Governing Territory, this year's Seminar had a more focused agenda devoted to advancing the decolonization process in the Caribbean and Bermuda. The Seminar was attended by a number of chief ministers from the Non-Self-Governing Territories. It provided a mutually beneficial opportunity for a direct interaction and exchange of views between the members of the Committee and the representatives of the administering Power and the Territories.</div>
	<div class="p">Part II of the report of the Special Committee presents an account of its deliberations of the issues on its agenda related to the individual Territories. During the period under review, the Committee continued to pay special attention to political, economic and social developments in the small island Territories and followed the situations in American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guam, Montserrat, Pitcairn, Saint Helena, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands, as well as Tokelau and New Caledonia.</div>
	<div class="p">The report also reflects the consideration by the Special Committee of the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Gibraltar, the question of Western Sahara and the decision concerning Puerto Rico.</div>
	<div class="p">The consideration of the developments in the Non-Self-Governing Territories by the Special Committee has been greatly facilitated by the working papers on each Territory prepared by the Secretariat.</div>
	<div class="p">In concluding my presentation of the report, I should like to express the gratitude of the Special Committee to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Kofi Annan, for his continuing unqualified support of the efforts of the Special Committee towards the eradication of colonialism. I should also like to highlight with appreciation the substantive political support and advice provided by the Department of Political Affairs, whose input has been invaluable in the work of the Committee and in the implementation of its mandate. I should equally like to refer to the excellent technical Secretariat services provided by the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management and to wish Mr. Mohammad Sattar, the outgoing Secretary of the Special Committee, who is retiring, best wishes for the future.</div>

	Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">As the General Assembly begins its consideration of the item concerning the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, I have the honour to address the Assembly as Vice-Chairman of the Special Committee on Decolonization, on behalf of the Acting Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Bernard Tanoh-Boutchoué, who was unable to be present.</div>
	<div class="p">The Rapporteur of the Special Committee has already introduced the report of the Committee for the past year, contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-58-23">A/58/23</a>. I wish briefly to review the activities of the Special Committee and introduce the draft resolution that we will consider. At the same time, I will stress the most important areas of work of the Special Committee for the next year. Much remains to be done to conclude the decolonization process. This is the third year of the Second International Decade for the Elimination of Colonialism, and 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories remain on our programme of work.</div>
	<div class="p">This year, in keeping with the mandate of the Special Committee, we have examined developments in each one of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, based on the information provided by the Administering Powers pursuant to Article 73 <i>e</i> of the Charter, the working papers on each Territory, prepared by the Secretariat, and the statements made by representatives of the Territories, petitioners, non-governmental organizations and experts.</div>
	<div class="p">In June, the Committee adopted by consensus nine resolutions and one decision. We have continued to bring to the attention of the international community the importance of the joint activities of the Economic and Social Council and the Special Committee aimed at giving development assistance to the Territories. In July, the Economic and Social Council adopted a resolution on the implementation of the Declaration on decolonization by specialized agencies.</div>
	<div class="p">The regional seminars, held annually by the Special Committee in the Caribbean or the Pacific, have always been a valuable opportunity for representatives of the Territories, the Special Committee and other members of the United Nations, non-governmental organizations and various experts to exchange views and opinions and to examine various matters pertaining to the situation in the Territories.</div>
	<div class="p">In May, a seminar was held for the first time in one of the Non-Self-Governing Territories -- Anguilla. The seminar programme is aimed at promoting the decolonization process in the Caribbean Territories and Bermuda. Direct interaction and deliberations among the participants enabled everyone -- members of the Committee, representatives of the Administering Powers, Member States and of the Non-Self-Governing Territories -- to understand clearly the need for all parties concerned to support, with practical and concrete measures, the common desire to achieve decolonization.</div>
	<div class="p">As the Assembly will recall, the Special Committee attributes great importance to the function of Administering Powers in the effective fulfilment of decolonization goals and, in that regard, has endeavoured to work in close cooperation with them. In recent years, the Special Committee has welcomed the cooperation that has characterized its relations with New Zealand. This year, the working relationship of the Special Committee with the United Kingdom and the United States, although informal, has also improved.</div>
	<div class="p">The Special Committee hopes to continue working with all the Administering Powers to give effect to the proposal that it formulated some time ago to prepare decolonization plans for the various Territories. In that regard, I also wish to reiterate the obligation of Member States, pursuant to the Charter, to ensure that the interests of the peoples of the Territories are borne in mind.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to say a few words on the draft resolution concerning the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.21.pdf">A/58/L.21</a>. That draft resolution is along the same lines as <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-140.pdf">resolution 57/140</a>, adopted by the General Assembly at the previous session. In the preambular part, the draft resolution refers to the Second International Decade for the Elimination of Colonialism and reaffirms that the existence of colonialism is incompatible with the Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1960 Declaration on decolonization. It reaffirms the Special Committee's resolve to achieve the complete and rapid elimination of colonialism. The draft resolution reaffirms also the General Assembly's support for the aspirations of peoples under colonial domination to exercise their right to self-determination, including independence, in keeping with United Nations resolutions on decolonization.</div>
	<div class="p">It urges the Administering Powers to conclude, before the end of 2004, a constructive programme of work, case by case, for the Non-Self-Governing Territories, with the aim of facilitating fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Committee and resolutions on decolonization, including those relating to specific territories. In that context, in operative paragraph 7, the Assembly welcomes the consultations taking place between the Special Committee and the representatives of the Government of New Zealand and the people of Tokelau, with the view to carrying forward the programme of work on the question of Tokelau.</div>
	<div class="p">Paragraph 8 contains provisions on the Special Committee's programme of work for the coming year. The Assembly asks the Committee to formulate specific proposals to put an end to colonialism, to review the implementation of relevant resolutions by Member States, to follow the political, economic and social situations of Non-Self-Governing Territories, to conclude by the end of 2004 a constructive programme of work on a case-by-case basis for the Non-Self-Governing Territories, to continue sending visiting missions, to carry out seminars in order to garner support worldwide for the decolonization process and, finally, to mark annually the Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories.</div>
	<div class="p">Some paragraphs of the draft resolution refer expressly to the economic activities and the exploitation of natural resources of the Territories. They call on Member States and specialized agencies to give moral and material support to the peoples of the Territories, and request Administering Powers to use bilateral and multilateral assistance to strengthen the economy of those Territories.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution reiterates that visiting United Nations missions are an effective instrument for learning about the situation in the Territories, urges the Administering Powers to facilitate those missions and urges those Administering Powers that have not participated officially in the work of the Special Committee to do so at its 2004 session.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, the draft resolution asks the Secretary-General, specialized agencies and other agencies of the United Nations system to lend economic and social assistance to the Territories and to continue doing so once those Territories have exercised their right to self-determination, including independence.</div>
	<div class="p">The text of the draft resolution before the Assembly has been prepared with the participation of interested delegations in a spirit of cooperation. I appeal to all delegations to favourably consider the recommendations contained in the draft resolution, so that the Special Committee on decolonization can maintain and enhance the momentum it gained at the last session to put an end to colonialism in the world.</div>
	<div class="p">In fulfilment of the mandate conferred on it by the General Assembly, the Special Committee proposes in the coming year to intensify its activities to conclude the decolonization process in the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories. Furthermore, it proposes to expand its cooperation with the administering Powers and provide assistance to the peoples of the Territories with a view to finding lasting and mutually acceptable solutions to the remaining problems.</div>
	<div class="p">Before concluding, I would like, on behalf of all the members of the Special Committee, to thank the Secretary-General for the valuable substantive and technical support given to us by the Secretariat over the year.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Cole" nation="Ireland" language="">
	Mr. Cole (Ireland)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It is a great privilege and honour for me to introduce to the General Assembly the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) submitted under agenda items 81 to 90, as well as items 12 and 19. These reports, contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-58-470.pdf">A/58/470</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-58-480.pdf">A/58/480</a>, include the texts of draft resolutions and decisions recommended to the General Assembly for adoption. For the convenience of delegations, a checklist prepared by the Secretariat of voting in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) is contained in A/C.4/58/INF/3.</div>
	<div class="p">During this first part of the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly, the Fourth Committee held a total of 24 formal meetings. The Committee continued its practice of having an informal interactive meeting under agenda item 85, "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects". An open-ended working group established by the Committee under item 82, "International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space", also held a number of informal meetings.</div>
	<div class="p">During that stage of its work, the Special Political and Decolonization Committee adopted 23 draft resolutions and two draft decisions, of which 10 draft resolutions and both draft decisions were adopted without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">The first report, submitted under agenda item 81, "Effects of atomic radiation", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-470.pdf">A/58/470</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), as contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-46.pdf">A/58/46</a>. The draft resolution submitted under that agenda item is contained in paragraph 7 of the report of the Fourth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">In the draft resolution, the General Assembly would, among other things, request UNSCEAR to continue its work and to report to the General Assembly on its review of the important problems in the field of ionizing radiation. The United Nations Environment Programme is urged to review and strengthen the present funding of UNSCEAR, so that it can discharge the responsibility and mandate entrusted to it. On behalf of the Fourth Committee, I recommend the adoption of that draft resolution by the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The second report, submitted under agenda item 82, "International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-471.pdf">A/58/471</a>. During its consideration of the item, the Fourth Committee held a number of informal meetings of an open-ended working group, chaired by the delegation of Chile. The working group formulated the draft resolutions contained in paragraph 14 of the report.</div>
	<div class="p">In the first draft resolution, the General Assembly would, among other things, endorse the report of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and urge States that have not yet done so to become parties to the five treaties governing the uses of outer space. The General Assembly would also urge States, in particular those with major space capabilities, to actively contribute to the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space, as an essential condition for the promotion of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.</div>
	<div class="p">In the second draft resolution contained in that report, the Assembly would decide to conduct a review of the progress made in implementing the recommendations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III). The review would be conducted in plenary meeting in October 2004 under a separate agenda item, entitled "Review of the implementation of the recommendations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space".</div>
	<div class="p">The third report of the Committee, submitted under agenda item 83, "United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-472.pdf">A/58/472</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report of the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-58-13">A/58/13</a> and Add.1, as well as the report of the Working Group on the Financing of UNRWA and other relevant reports by the Secretary-General. Under this item, the Committee adopted five draft resolutions related to various aspects of the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Their adoption, in place of the customary seven resolutions, would ensure the continuation of the important functions of UNRWA in alleviating the sufferings of the Palestine refugees, while streamlining the work of the Fourth Committee on this question. Those draft resolutions are contained in paragraph 32 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends the adoption of the draft resolutions to the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The fourth report, submitted under agenda item 84, "Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-473.pdf">A/58/473</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report of the Special Committee concerning the protection and promotion of the human rights of the Palestinian people and other Arab inhabitants of the occupied territories, as well as other reports by the Secretary-General submitted under that item. In the course of the debate on that item, the activities of the Special Committee were widely supported by many States, although some delegations expressed concern about the work of the Special Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">Under that item, after due deliberation, the Fourth Committee adopted five draft resolutions, which can be found in paragraph 25 of its report. The Fourth Committee recommends the draft resolutions to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p">The fifth report, relating to agenda item 85, "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-474.pdf">A/58/474</a>. The Fourth Committee heard a comprehensive introductory statement by the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, and held a general debate under that item. It also held informal interactive discussions with the Under-Secretary-General and other senior officials of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Many of the issues raised during the general debate and the interactive discussions will be further considered by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations at its forthcoming session early next year.</div>
	<div class="p">The sixth report, submitted under agenda item 86, "Questions relating to information", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-475.pdf">A/58/475</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report submitted by the Committee on Information (<a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-58-21">A/58/21</a>) and the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/A-58-175.pdf">A/58/175</a>). The Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information, Mr. Shashi Tharoor, delivered a comprehensive introductory statement and responded to questions raised by delegations during the general debate on the ongoing and fundamental reorientation of the focus and structure of the Department of Public Information at Headquarters and in the field. The Fourth Committee adopted, without a vote, two draft resolutions and one draft decision, which are contained in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the report.</div>
	<div class="p">In draft resolution A, the Assembly would urge Member States, inter alia, to enhance regional efforts and cooperation among developing countries, as well as cooperation between developed and developing countries; and to strengthen communication capacities and improve the media infrastructure and communication technology in the developing countries, especially in the areas of training and dissemination of information.</div>
	<div class="p">In draft resolution B, the Assembly would, among other things, welcome the restructuring of the Department of Public Information, encourage the Secretary-General to continue its reorientation, emphasize the importance of multilingualism and endorse the new programmatic priorities of the Department.</div>
	<div class="p">Here, I would like to draw the attention of delegates to a technical change in the draft resolution. In paragraph 82 of the draft resolution, at the end of page 16 of the English version of the report, the words "main part of its fifty-eighth session" at the end of the paragraph, should be changed to, "twenty-sixth session of the Committee on Information".</div>
	<div class="p">The draft decision would also appoint Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Switzerland members of the Committee on Information, increasing its membership to 102. The Special Political and Decolonization Committee recommends that the General Assembly adopt both draft resolutions and the draft decision.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to the cluster of items on Non-Self-Governing Territories and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and People, agenda items 87, 88, 89, 90, 12 and 19, the Fourth Committee considered these items together. The Committee had one single general debate on the cluster of items and heard one representative and 13 petitioners from various Non-Self-Governing Territories. Under these items, the General Assembly has before it five reports.</div>
	<div class="p">The report submitted under agenda item 87, "Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 <i>e</i> of the Charter of the United Nations", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-476.pdf">A/58/476</a>. The draft resolution submitted under this item appears in paragraph 7 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends it to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p">The report relating to agenda items 88, "Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-477.pdf">A/58/477</a>. Under this item, the Fourth Committee adopted one draft resolution entitled "Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories", contained in paragraph 7 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends this draft resolution and the draft decision to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p">The report relating to agenda item 89, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations", and item 12, "Report of the Economic and Social Council", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-478.pdf">A/58/478</a>. In paragraph 7 of the report, the Fourth Committee recommends one draft resolution to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p">The report relating to agenda item 90, "Offers by Member States of study and training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-58-479.pdf">A/58/479</a>. Under this item, the Fourth Committee recommends one draft resolution, which is contained in paragraph 6 of the report, for adoption by the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The report submitted under agenda item 19, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-480.pdf">A/57/480</a>, which contains the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples relating to specific territories not covered by other agenda items.</div>
	<div class="p">In this context, the Fourth Committee adopted four draft resolutions and one draft decision. The draft resolutions on the "Question of Western Sahara"; "Question of New Caledonia"; "Question of Tokelau"; the consolidated omnibus draft resolution concerning the 11 territories; as well as the draft decision on the "Question of Gibraltar" all were adopted without a vote by the Fourth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">Here, I should like to pay tribute to the spirit of cooperation that prevailed in the Committee after lengthy consultations on the question of Western Sahara. The four draft resolutions are contained in paragraph 25 of the report, and the draft decision is contained in paragraph 26. The Fourth Committee recommends that the General Assembly adopt those draft resolutions and the draft decision.</div>
	<div class="p">Before concluding, I should like to recall the high level of cooperation prevailing in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee. Though the work of the Committee was prolonged an additional week in order to enable it to reach a successful conclusion, the Committee was able to fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by the Assembly and to complete its work effectively and constructively.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like also to express, on behalf of the Bureau of the Fourth Committee, our profound appreciation to those delegations that coordinated the efforts on the consolidation of the draft resolutions adopted by the Committee. I should like also to thank all delegations that participated in our efforts to reach consensus on many draft resolutions and decisions.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to pay particular tribute here to the Chairman of the Fourth Committee, Mr. Enrique Loedel of Uruguay, whose knowledge and experience in multilateral forums, enhanced by his consummate diplomatic skills, enabled the Committee to consider in depth all the agenda items allocated to it by the General Assembly, and whose focus and determination greatly facilitated our deliberations on a number of sensitive issues. This was particularly important given the wide-ranging and often difficult issues assigned to this Committee. Other members of the Bureau, namely Ms. Jasna Ognjanovac of Croatia, Mr. Ibrahim Assaf of Lebanon, and Mr. Isaac Lamba of Malawi, with whom I had the pleasure of working, have also contributed greatly to the successful conclusion of the work of the Fourth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like also to place on record our appreciation for the excellent assistance provided by Mr. Saijin Zhang, the Secretary of the Committee, Ms. Christa Giles and the very competent team from the Secretariat. It is thanks to their efforts that the work of the Committee always proceeded smoothly and in an atmosphere of genuine cordiality and efficiency. We are very grateful to them for ensuring that we were able to complete our work successfully.</div>
	<div class="p">I now have the honour to submit to the General Assembly for its consideration and adoption the recommendations of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee set out in the reports contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-58-470.pdf">A/58/470</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-58-480.pdf">A/58/480</a>.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">In July 1999, the United Nations held its Third Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III), which set out a series of important and far-reaching recommendations. Having participated in that Conference, Thailand subsequently joined some of the action teams established to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE III. Those include action teams on disaster management and on knowledge-sharing through the promotion of universal access to space-based communication services.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, Thailand also co-organized in November 2002, with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites, the European Space Agency and France the second United Nations Regional Workshop in Bangkok on the Use of Space Technology for Disaster Management. Last September, Thailand also hosted in Bangkok a United Nations workshop on the contribution of space communication technology to bridging the digital divide.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to matters related to the remote sensing of the Earth via satellite, including applications for developing countries and the monitoring of the Earth's environment, Thailand is also cooperating with a number of countries under the planned disaster-monitoring constellation. It is also worth mentioning that the Thailand ground receiving station has been providing satellite data to a number of countries in the region.</div>
	<div class="p">Those activities reflect Thailand's interest and readiness to participate actively and fully in the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. It is therefore our fervent hope that the resolution on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space (<a href="../pdf/A-58-471.pdf">A/58/471</a>), which was just adopted without a vote, will pave the way for the future enlargement of the Committee, taking into account the principle of equitable geographical distribution as well as previous work and accomplishments in the field. In so doing, we also hope that such enlargement would not preclude any interested State, including Thailand, from presenting its case to serve the Committee as a full member in the near future.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, with the adoption of the resolution on the review of UNISPACE III, adopted without a vote, Thailand welcomes the decision made by the Assembly to conduct the review at its fifty-ninth session. Thailand looks forward to participating actively in that review.</div>

	<div class="p">In that connection, we are pleased to note that a number of United Nations bodies have specific provisions within their rules of procedure to provide such assistance, including the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations regional commissions. The United Nations Development Programme is to be especially commended for its effective coordination of assistance from the wider United Nations system. We call on other United Nations bodies to follow suit by reviewing and adjusting their mandate to provide a mechanism for assisting Non-Self-Governing Territories in their development process, consistent with the extensive mandate of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">We are concerned that the number of reports on the implementation of this resolution requested from United Nations bodies continues to be insufficient. We call on the agencies concerned to respond to the request of the Secretary-General to report on their assistance to the Territories.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, it is regrettable that this important resolution has carried a number of abstentions in the General Assembly and in the Economic and Social Council. We are hopeful that future consultations will yield consensus on a streamlined companion text that would garner the full support of the General Assembly, consistent with the critical role of the wider United Nations system in providing assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories.</div>

	<div class="p">Regrettably, the United Sates cannot support the draft resolution on implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. By adopting a narrow definition of decolonization, the draft resolution fails to take into account the complex reality of Non-Self-Governing Territories. For the United States, the very term "non-self-governing" seems inappropriate for those who can establish their own constitution, elect their own public officers, have representation in Washington and choose their own economic path.</div>
	<div class="p">The United States fully supports countries that choose independence, and we are proud to welcome them as equal and sovereign partners. However, not all Territories choose independence, and we equally support their right to a full measure of self-government, including the rights to integration and free association. The world encompasses a wide variety of people, places and political circumstances. That richness does not allow for just one path. The United States believes that a single standard should be applied to every Territory, and we call upon Member States to respect the choices that are made by residents of Non-Self-Governing Territories.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, we look forward to a significant dialogue with the Committee of 24 in 2004, and it is our hope that all parties will cooperate so that a reduction in the number of Non-Self-Governing Territories can be achieved.</div>

	<div class="p">I should like to explain the United Kingdom's votes on the resolutions on dissemination of information on decolonization and on implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. As Members will have seen, the United Kingdom voted against both of those resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to the resolution on dissemination of information on decolonization, the United Kingdom remains of the view that the obligation that that text places on the Secretariat to publicize decolonization issues represents an unwarranted drain on the scarce resources of the United Nations. The resolution is, therefore, unacceptable to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom also continues to find some elements of the text of the resolution on the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to be unacceptable. However, despite our negative votes on those resolutions, the United Kingdom remains committed to modernizing its relationship with the overseas Territories, taking fully into account the views of the peoples of those Territories and continuing to further the process of informal dialogue with the Special Committee of 24 on decolonization over the coming year.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">My delegation voted in favour of the resolution on the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, because of its importance in reiterating the relevance of the principles of self-determination and decolonization to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, in particular, the small island Territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.</div>
	<div class="p">We take particular note of the reference in operative paragraph 8 calling for implementation of actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the First and Second International Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism. In this connection, we are pleased with the insertion in the proposed programme budget for Political Affairs for 2004-2005 of an added indicator of achievement, namely, the effectiveness of research and analytical studies and reports on conditions in the Territories, and the effectiveness of publicity campaigns.</div>
	<div class="p">Information derived from these studies would be critical to the understanding of the often complex nature of the situation on the ground in the Territories themselves, if we are to make informed decisions in this Assembly to bridge the democratic deficit which is inherent in even the most benevolent of colonial models. Accordingly, we call on the Department of Political Affairs to ensure that it carries out this unimplemented mandate by arranging for the completion of these important studies and analyses.</div>
