<p>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): This
morning, the General Assembly will begin a two-day high-
level dialogue on the theme of the social and economic
impact of globalization and interdependence and their
policy implications, in accordance with the decision taken
by the General Assembly at its 3rd plenary meeting, held
on 15 September 1998, pursuant to resolutions 50/122 of 20
December 1995 and 52/186 of 18 December 1997 as well
as decision 52/480 of 4 June 1998.
</p>
<p>
The focus and the modalities of the dialogue are
outlined in documents A/52/832 and A/52/919.
</p>
<p>
In particular, Member States considered that, in order
to stimulate high-level interest and ensure interactive
dialogue, a combination of plenary meetings, ministerial
round tables and informal panels would be the best
</p>
<blockquote>
approach. As was agreed, two ministerial round tables and
two informal panels will be held in conjunction with the
plenary meetings of the high-level dialogue.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Following consultations, for the first ministerial
round table, on national responses to globalization, I have
the pleasure to appoint His Excellency Mr. Helmut
Schäfer, Minister of State of Germany, as Chairman, and
His Excellency Mr. Percy Metsing Mangoaela, Permanent
Representative of Lesotho to the United Nations, as
Rapporteur.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
For
the
second
ministerial
round
table,
on
international responses to globalization, I have the
pleasure to appoint His Excellency Mr. Ali Alatas,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, as Chairman,
and His Excellency Mr. Janis Priedkalns, Permanent
Representative of Latvia to the United Nations, as
Rapporteur.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
As indicated in document A/52/832, each rapporteur
will present a summary report to the General Assembly
at the plenary meeting to be held tomorrow at 5 p.m.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
With regard to the plenary meetings of the General
Assembly to be held during the high-level dialogue, as
indicated in today's <i>Journal</i>, in addition to this morning's
meeting, the Assembly will meet this afternoon at 4 p.m.
and tomorrow afternoon at 5 p.m.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
As to the length of statements in plenary meetings,
it has been suggested in the information note transmitted
</blockquote>
<p>
to Member States that statements should not exceed seven
minutes. In order to allow the Assembly to hear all the
speakers already on the list, I appeal to Member States to
cooperate in this respect.
</p>
<p>
The schedule for the two ministerial round tables and
the two informal panels is also indicated in today's <i>Journal</i>.
</p>
<blockquote>
I shall now make a statement.
</blockquote>
<p>
Today the General Assembly is to consider a matter
that is on the minds of leaders and policy makers
throughout the world. Recent events show that globalization
and its consequences affect all countries. The forces of
global integration and the ways in which we deal, or fail to
deal, with them will affect the future of the world in the
twenty-first century. The Assembly, which is a sort of
world parliament, bears a special responsibility to be all-
inclusive and to universalize the world dialogue on this
critical issue.
</p>
<p>
Every day we hear disturbing news about the situation
of various financial markets. The instability of currency
markets is tangibly and tragically reflected in crises caused
by the convergence of many domestic and external factors.
Some of those factors arise from decisions by the
responsible authorities, while others are related to the
actions of market players, who in most cases are not subject
to certain rules of prudence that ought to be universal.
</p>
<p>
Market
globalization
has
undeniably
led
to
improvements in economies on the world level, but there
have also been negative phenomena; some of these are
localized, but often their scope and effects extend beyond
national territories to a greater or lesser -- but always
significant -- degree. Here I need only refer to the so-
called tequila effect and to the South-East Asian crisis. In
the first case, I would recall that it led to direct intervention
by international credit agencies such as the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Interamerican
Development Bank, not to mention contributions by
friendly countries.
</p>
<p>
As to the case of South-East Asia, initially diagnosed
as a short-term crisis, recovery has not taken place, and
what began as a national problem became a regional one,
ultimately taking on international dimensions, whose final
effects are still difficult to foresee.
</p>
<p>
To be sure, the crisis is not restricted to the financial
markets, but affects the entire economy, has a negative
impact on investment flows, puts pressure on bank reserves,
</p>
<blockquote>
diminishes trade, causes unemployment with its attendant
social problems, and to a greater or lesser extent
influences the political course of the States that are
affected. The economies of States of the greatest
importance on the world scene have not escaped the
contagious effects of this situation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In a way, this was logical and foreseeable in a world
in which the market is no longer subject to limits other
than those of free competition and the unrestricted
circulation of goods and currency, which have come to
constitute the prevailing model.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
If we add to this that in many cases the affected
countries had been making great efforts to implement
anti-inflationary adjustment policies, we see that the
solution to this financial and economic problem cannot be
achieved through isolated efforts on the part of the
economies concerned. This has been reflected in the
recent measures adopted by the Group of Seven and in
those taken by the Government of the United States to
provide financial cooperation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Moreover, in line with the position taken by regional
finance ministers, who met in Washington two weeks ago,
the Rio Group, at its most recent summit, in Panama,
focused its attention on this matter and called for a clear
response from the agencies with responsibility in this
sphere.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Thus far we have seen spontaneous or institutional
responses from ad hoc groups of countries and agencies,
each in line with its own capabilities.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In any event, it has become obvious that the
international financial system has been unable to prevent
the current crisis and that international cooperation
mechanisms of the United Nations and elsewhere have
been unable to act with complete effectiveness on the
causes of the problem. Ultimately, the Bretton Woods
institutional system has proven insufficient in addressing
the negative effects, which are not the intentional result
of globalization but are closely associated with it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We must not cry over spilt milk or, worse, yet, rely
on individual forces and act alone. As we see it, this is
not a question of discussing globalization in hypothetical
or doctrinal terms. That might be of interest in igniting
academic debates, which are always welcome. What is
clear, however, is that it would not be sufficiently helpful
at present, when our challenge is to be imaginative and to
</blockquote>
<p>
adopt concerted measures based on principles of order and
cooperation that are necessary as never before.
</p>
<p>
That is why this dialogue is very timely. It may give
birth to new ideas about United Nations programmes -- the
United Nations Development
Programme
and
other
agencies, such as the United Nations Children's Fund, the
United Nations Population Fund, the International Fund for
Agricultural Development and others -- and on the need to
give attention and resources to all of these in order to
create and enhance the United Nations role as international
facilitator.
</p>
<p>
The United Nations attaches particular importance to
that role today, with a scope even greater than in the past
and in the framework of the principles of universality and
legitimacy -- in other words, the right of all developing
countries
without
exception
to
receive
international
cooperation. This dialogue can also lead to suggestions and
even recommendations for channelling the future work of
the Organization in this field. The most important
consideration, however, may be the need to develop new
institutional mechanisms capable of acting preventively and
of providing deterrents through the evaluation and
assessment of "cross-border" operations which, because
they have become so complex and intense, require, like
urban traffic, new cautionary or even stop signs and signals,
as one international analyst recently put it. The monetary
and financial discipline of countries will not be enough to
address situations such as that confronting the international
economy.
</p>
<p>
We need to consider what adjustments may be
necessary in the post-war institutional situation. In this
endeavour, the United Nations must be present with the
active participation of all its Member States. The United
Nations drawing power, universality and responsibility in
helping to order international political, economic and social
relations best suit it to that task. Of course, the need to find
new patterns or channels and better instruments for the
functioning of the international financial system is in
essence no different from the desire to reform and
modernize that has led to the current reform exercise in the
United Nations Security Council.
</p>
<p>
It is my hope that, at the conclusion of this meeting,
each and every participant will feel that we are all able
together to resolve lucidly the problems we face without
sacrificing the principles and basic values of our United
Nations.
</p>
<blockquote>
It is now my pleasure to give the floor to the Deputy
Secretary-General, Ms. Louise Fréchette.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Ms.</b>
<b>Fréchette</b>
(Deputy
Secretary-General):
I
welcome all to this exceptionally timely session.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Less than two years ago, when the idea of convening
this meeting was first mooted, we were all much more
optimistic about global economic prospects than we are
now. There were signs of improvement even in countries
that had been struggling.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Since then, the Asian downturn has triggered a far-
reaching
economic
crisis
with
devastating
social
consequences. Some of the most successful economies
have been suddenly plunged into crisis. All of us in the
international community have been taken by surprise. And
we seem ill equipped to cope with the consequences.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The simple truth is that global markets, like domestic
markets, can fail. Measures to correct market failure are,
of course, needed from national authorities, not least those
of developing countries. But the success of those
measures in overcoming the crisis will depend -- and
critically so -- on actions taken by the world's leading
economic Powers. And those Powers cannot afford to
ignore what is happening in developing countries. Even
the largest economies today are increasingly influenced by
events in the poorer parts of the world. Causality runs in
both directions. And so self-interest on both sides calls
for cooperative responses to the threats which now
confront us all.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
At this critical juncture, the most urgent tasks are to
restore market confidence; to stabilize financial markets;
to support growth; to endow international financial
institutions with the means they require; and, last but not
least, to provide immediate protection for the most
vulnerable. We appeal to Governments to live up to this
challenge. The problems we are facing are no longer
national, nor regional, but global. President Clinton's
recognition of this fact in his statement on Monday is an
important step forward.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But, while crisis management is crucial, it is not
enough. The more fundamental challenge we face is to
engage with the new realities of an increasingly
interdependent world. The world economy has entered
uncharted waters; fear and anxiety about its future course
are spreading. In such an insecure climate, some people
are tempted to view globalization as the root cause of
</blockquote>
<p>
crisis and insecurity, or even as the embodiment of
economic and social evil.
</p>
<p>
The reality is more complex. Globalization has
brought about as many benefits as it has engendered new
risks. The volatility of short-term capital flows does not
mean that other forms of capital flows, such as foreign
direct investment, follow similar patterns or have the same
economic impact. On the contrary, freer capital flows have
provided a great stimulus to growth in many countries. Yes,
technology can be a threat to established cultures, but
without it there can be no growth and no development.
</p>
<p>
Our ability to overcome this crisis depends crucially
on markets remaining open. And the ability of developing
countries to overcome it depends above all on markets
remaining open in the industrialized world. Thus, the real
question we confront today is not whether to embrace or
reject globalization. The questions are, first, how can we
retain and build on the growth-generating forces of markets
while reducing the destructive effects of volatility? And
secondly, how can we extend the benefits of globalization
to those groups and individuals who at present are being
left behind?
</p>
<p>
We cannot predict the future, but we can learn from
the past. Market forces are increasingly global in scope. In
some areas, market integration has progressed at a rapid
pace. But we have not yet developed institutions capable of
dealing with the problems that globalization brings, nor
have we succeeded, to anything like an adequate extent, in
providing real opportunities for those countries and peoples
who risk being marginalized.
</p>
<p>
While markets and related problems have become
global, the reach of Governments struggling to address
them remains strictly local. That mismatch is at the root of
many problems we are facing today. If domestic markets
are to realize their full potential and if their negative effects
are to be contained, they must be underpinned by shared
values that reflect the broader aspirations of society, with
clear and equitable laws enforced by an effective public
authority. On that we can all agree.
</p>
<p>
But as markets go global, so the rules increasingly
need to be global as well. The creation of a rule-based
international trading system has been one of the great
successes
of
the
last
50
years,
and
is
generally
acknowledged
to
have
benefited
industrialized
and
developing countries alike. This should remind us that
multilateral cooperation, the existence of well-functioning
global rules and a level playing field that protects the weak
</p>
<blockquote>
against the strong are necessary preconditions for
spreading benefits and reducing risks. We should learn
from this experience when searching for new answers to
new problems.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Here at the United Nations, as elsewhere, a major
effort is now in progress to rethink what has been termed
the "architecture" of the international system for
economic cooperation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
More than 50 years ago, world leaders met at
Bretton Woods and San Francisco to design new
institutions for the post-war world. If those institutions
have underpinned international cooperation since then, it
is because their founders were not afraid to take risks or
to challenge conventional ideas. Our generation must be
equally bold and creative in adapting those same
institutions to the realities of today, and we must come up
with answers that reflect a broad consensus throughout
the international community. Only institutions enjoying
solid and widespread support can be effective in creating
conditions of stable and equitable growth in every part of
the world.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Open, well-functioning markets are not an end in
themselves. They are a tool in the hands of society, a tool
to achieve a broader purpose. The systems and rules that
we design must facilitate, and not hinder, the attainment
of higher goals. Ultimately, the success and sustainability
of market-based approaches will not be measured by
stock market gains for the few. They will stand or fall by
the degree to which they make possible the achievement
of the promise of the Charter: social progress, better
standards of life and real freedom for humankind as a
whole.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is indeed one of the most tragic effects of the
current crisis that the most vulnerable groups have been
worst hit, both within countries and on the global scale.
In Indonesia alone, according to a recent study of the
International Labour Organization (ILO), 15,000 workers
are losing their jobs every day. The least developed
countries of Asia are facing drastic reductions in much-
needed investment inflows from other Asian countries.
Commodity exporters in Latin America and Africa are
struggling with falling prices. Overall, it is the countries
which had embarked on the most fragile economic
recoveries that are now placed in the greatest jeopardy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Each country's crisis has its own peculiar features
and causes. Each country has to address its own specific
problems and shortcomings. Much can and must be done
</blockquote>
<p>
at the domestic level. Institutional reform, increased
accountability and transparency and the rule of law are
indispensable if markets are to realize their growth-
generating potential. Clear priority must be given to
reducing poverty, not just for its own sake but because
improving the health and education levels of the poorest
means helping them become autonomous, productive
citizens. Such domestic efforts are crucial; but even with
the best policies in the world, many developing countries
will not be able to improve the welfare of their populations
unless
they
also
receive
increased
and
sustained
international assistance.
</p>
<p>
The Secretary-General has repeatedly appealed for
more vigorous action on debt, so as to free the most heavily
indebted countries from a burden which they simply cannot
carry. Official development assistance will also continue to
be an essential component of development strategy,
especially for the poorest countries. Both the level and the
character of official development assistance must be
improved.
All
partners in
development --
recipient
countries, multilateral institutions, bilateral donors and non-
governmental organizations -- must ask themselves what
forms international assistance should take and where efforts
should
now
be
concentrated
in
this
new
era
of
globalization.
</p>
<p>
With over 1 billion people living in dire poverty and
the gap between rich and poor widening every day -- both
within and between nations -- the international community
cannot afford to wait. This is perhaps the most important
challenge we face as we approach the new millennium.
</p>
<p>
Yet in spite of these constructive steps, and
notwithstanding the new consensus on development and the
reorientation of international cooperation, the cause of
development has not moved substantially forward in recent
times. There are still hundreds of millions of human beings
languishing in poverty in the developing world. The basic
interests of the developing countries are being increasingly
sidelined, especially in the core areas of development such
as access to trade, financial flows and technology transfers,
as the agenda and purposes of the powerful economies
continue to dominate international economic decision-
making. The concept of development as a special part of a
multilateral support system has been replaced by the
laissez-faire approach to the globalized economy.
</p>
<p>
Globalization has opened up tremendous opportunities
for creating wealth, but its rewards seem reserved for the
strongest of economies -- those that are the best equipped
to avail themselves of the opportunities. On the other hand,
</p>
<blockquote>
it can lash out with awesome ferocity at vulnerable
developing
economies.
Even
the
more
dynamic
developing economies, those that have managed to
integrate themselves with the global economy through
judicious
macroeconomic
policies
and
painstaking
structural adjustments, have seen the development gains
that they earned over the decades crumble in the span of
a few weeks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
If this trend continues, then globalization will further
widen the economic gap between the developed and
developing countries, between the haves and the have-
nots, further impoverishing the poor. For instance, the
developing world loses enormous amounts of foreign
exchange every year because of outflows resulting from
terms-of-trade losses, the external debt burden, payments
for imported technology and the repatriation of the profits
of multinationals.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The fact that the Asian crisis has been particularly
harsh on those economies that have been liberalizing
financial flows and investments for a good number of
years should therefore teach a valuable lesson to all of us
in the developing world. In those severely affected
countries, various economic activities have slowed down
or ground to a halt and millions of jobs have been lost,
raising unemployment rates to unprecedented levels.
Millions of children have dropped out of school, adding
to the social problems of the affected countries. Soaring
inflation has brought the price of household commodities,
including basic food items, beyond the reach of many of
the poor.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And yet I firmly believe that even the most severely
affected economies are capable of an early recovery,
given an environment that is conducive to the rigorous
reform measures that they themselves are instituting as
well as access to development finance, to export markets
for their products and to technology appropriate to their
development requirements. Their early recovery is to the
interest of all countries, developed and developing alike,
for it will certainly restore their once considerable
contributions to world production. In the ultimate
analysis, no country is safe from the hazards of
globalization. The contagion effect of every financial and
economic crisis in every country and in every region will
always threaten the financial and economic stability of
every other country and region. The threat of a worldwide
recession, even possibly a global depression, is real. And
the most practical way to forestall such a dreadful
eventuality is to grapple with the crisis where it now
</blockquote>
<p>
occurs and overcome it there, before its tentacles can get a
hold on other regions.
</p>
<p>
The central challenge for the international community
is therefore to ferret out the root causes of this crisis and to
institute measures to ensure that these will not recur. To
start with, all who are involved in this dialogue are called
upon to contribute to the development of reasonable but
effective regulation of international money markets so that
they would become more open and transparent. It may also
be the dictate of prudence that we all consider establishing
a mechanism to mitigate the unpredictability and dire
effects of globalization and to ensure that the opportunities
it offers are equitably available to all countries.
</p>
<p>
Such a mechanism should be able to monitor and
carry out surveillance of capital markets and international
financial operations. We already have a mechanism of this
nature in the field of international trade: the World Trade
Organization. There is no reason why we cannot have a
similar mechanism in the field of financial and monetary
flows if it means the difference between order and chaos in
the global economy. For this purpose, an in-depth study of
the world monetary and financial system from the
perspective of the requirements of development is of crucial
importance.
</p>
<p>
In the face of the adverse impact of globalization, a
number of serious questions must be asked: how can it be
harnessed to promote the industrialization of the developing
countries and improve the linkages between industry,
development and trade? How can it be utilized to create
employment opportunities for the millions of young people
in the developing world who are about to join the labour
force? How can it be enlisted in the fight against poverty?
And above all, how can its pernicious aspects be tamed so
that it will wreak no injury on the vulnerable and so that
the enjoyment of its benefits will not mean the erosion of
our precious cultural values and traditions?
</p>
<p>
The only adequate answer I can think of is for us to
work for the establishment of a global governance that will
match the potency and the scope of globalization. In such
a global governance, the collective powers of all peoples to
shape our common future are mobilized. It will be a
constant process wherein individuals and institutions in the
public and private sectors and in all nations accommodate
and take cooperative action on their diverse and often
conflicting interests. Thus all who are involved in the
decision-making process are able to take their destiny in
their own hands. That global governance, however, is
possible only through the central instrumentality of a
</p>
<blockquote>
reformed, democratized and fully empowered United
Nations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Globalization is by no means an evil force, but it is
a blind force. Like the winds of change on the ocean of
history, it can shipwreck us or carry us to our intended
destination. The developed and developing countries are
all in the same boat, and our fate depends on how well
we work as a team in trimming the sails. Teamwork
means partnership. But we can form that envisioned
global partnership for development only when we are able
to accommodate one another's anxieties and aspirations as
a result of a mutual understanding born of sincere
dialogue -- such as the dialogue we are holding today.
Through this dialogue, therefore, let us begin to tame the
winds of globalization.
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Permit me first of all to congratulate you,

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We look forward to this two-day dialogue on the
social and economic impact of globalization and expect a
stimulating exchange of views on what globalization
means for our countries and regions, what the benefits
are, where the risks are, how the socio-economic
structures should develop in parallel to the new economic
environment and how we can work together to face these
enormous challenges. The United Nations, with its broad
mandate, could play a unique role in promoting greater
awareness of the links between the different policy areas
and in helping identify areas of common interest and
possible ways of common and concerted action.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The notion of globalization embraces the dynamics
of the world economy at the end of this millennium --
processes that have been partly unleashed and facilitated
by a new generation of technological innovations. Capital
</blockquote>
<p>
has achieved an unparalleled degree of mobility. The
volume of world trade and foreign direct investment is
increasing more rapidly than gross domestic product, and a
growing proportion of the increase is within transnational
companies themselves. The economic decisions of so-called
global players have a significant influence on national
economies and on future growth and development.
Governments find that their economies are more exposed to
global trends than in the past.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, liberalization and globalization have
generated positive developments for the world economy.
For the global economy as a whole, these factors promote
a more efficient allocation of resources and, thus, higher
growth worldwide. It is the continuation of the trend of
growing openness and integration among economies that
has brought the world half a century of unparalleled
prosperity. It has opened up the world's most populous
regions to international trade and helped developing
countries improve their standards of living. It has led to the
increasingly
rapid
dissemination
of
information,
technological innovation and the proliferation of skilled
jobs.
</p>
<p>
But globalization entails risks and poses challenges to
societies and economies. Financial instability caused by,
<i>inter alia</i>, the weakness of public and private banking and
financial structures made countries particularly vulnerable
to sudden shifts in market sentiments. Marginalization
constitutes a serious problem, in particular for the least
developed
countries.
The
countries
currently
being
marginalized are precisely those most in need of the trade,
investment and growth that global integration could
generate. This raises the prospect of a widening gulf
between countries that are able to benefit from globalization
and those that do not benefit or find it difficult to
participate.
</p>
<p>
Increasing income disparities pose the risk of
marginalization within countries. In many developing
countries in some regions, marked progress in poverty
reduction contrasts with increasing wage differentials. This
is paralleled by growing unemployment rates, particularly
within the unskilled labour force, resulting in an increased
share of people living in poverty in many developed
countries, as highlighted in this year's United Nations
Development Programme <i>Human Development Report</i>.
</p>
<p>
There are also fears that globalization endangers
environmental and social standards and undermines cultural
diversity as well as national and regional identities. The
complexities and the pace of change involved in the new
</p>
<blockquote>
globalized environment, as well as precarious working
and social conditions, constitute for many people a source
of insecurity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
As all these challenges transcend the mere economic
sphere we will not be able to cope with the consequences
of globalization only with the instruments of the market.
In order to address effectively the issues of inclusiveness
and participation and to achieve the goals set at the
Copenhagen Summit for Social Development to improve
the quality of life for all people, universal acceptance of
certain societal values is needed to make globalization an
overall positive development. The European Union
welcomes the deliberations of the last session of the
Commission for Social Development on social integration

As I stated before, globalization is an inherent part
of the development of the world of today. The challenge
we are facing at the national and international level is to
fully utilize its potential and to spread the benefits more
widely and
evenly, in
particular to the
poorest.
Governments, other public actors and civil societies have
to contribute effectively to shaping the forces that bring
about the changes and openness of modern economies.

<blockquote>
European integration should be seen as a means for
European countries and their citizens to more effectively
influence their future in a globalized world. It is an
answer to the demands of the new global economic
environment. The Single Market, with over 370 million
consumers, has given an immeasurable impetus to
economic activity in Europe by stimulating competition,
accelerating the pace of industrial restructuring and
providing a broader range of goods and services to
consumers at lower prices. At the same time, it has
remained open to products and investment from all over
the world. A further major step in the European
integration process constitutes the successful launch of the
single currency. The Euro should not only strengthen the
European response to the global challenges, but also
constitute a stabilizing factor for the world economy.

<blockquote>
European integration, however, should also be seen
as a catalyst for openness. The European Union is deeply
committed to living up to the historic challenge of
enlargement, to strengthening the partnership with the
African, Caribbean and Pacific countries through the

With over 18 million people currently out of work in
the European Union, the fight against unemployment is of
top priority. The Member States of the European Union
have intensified their efforts to address the structural
dimension
of
unemployment.
All
15
members
are
implementing employment action plans which focus on the
employability, in particular, of the young, long-term
unemployed and women; are actively promoting the
development of skills and lifelong learning; are seeking to
improve conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises
and the self-employed; and are taking measures to promote
work as opposed to dependence.
</p>
<p>
Let me now turn to the possible responses at the
international level: how to make best use of the enormous
possibilities globalization offers, while at the same time
limiting the risks it brings with it to acceptable levels.
</p>
<p>
One answer is obvious: the market economy would in
principle benefit from a world without artificial barriers.
But while most countries have been more or less successful
in steering their national economies, a similar process
internationally is still in its infancy. It is true that in recent
years an increasing number of countries have embraced
macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform. Fiscal
consolidation,
successful
anti-inflationary
policies,
deregulation and the opening up of economies have
produced investment, growth and jobs. The recent financial
and economic turmoil has further shown the importance of
sound domestic financial and banking systems with
adequate
supervisory
and
regulatory
frameworks,
transparency and good governance.
</p>
<p>
But the recent events have revealed severe weaknesses
in the functioning of the international financial system, as
well as in the lending practices of the private sector
investors. The increased integration of global capital
markets and the changes in the magnitude and composition
of international financial flows, as well as the increased
diversity and number of actors and instruments, require
strengthened financial systems addressing in particular the
following aspects: strengthened surveillance and crisis
management; early warning and preventive mechanisms;
best practices for banking regulation and supervision at the
national
level;
and
better
information
and
data
dissemination. The issue of moral hazard also needs to be
addressed in ensuring that the private sector takes
responsibility for its lending decisions.
</p>
<blockquote>
The liberalization of trade and investment regimes is
an important vehicle for fostering economic growth and
stability in poor countries. The integration of developing
countries, and in particular the least developed countries,
into the world trading system is one of the primary
objectives of the development policies of the European
Union. This objective will be attained only if a smooth
adaptation to the new conditions of international trade is
achieved. With regard to least developed countries in
particular, additional policies, such as support for trade-
related institution building, will have to be applied to this
end. The European Union will assist developing countries
in their efforts, with due regard to their choices as to the
means of their integration into the world economy and in
full conformity with the provisions of the World Trade
Organization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
While private capital and trade flows play a crucial
role in growth and reducing poverty in developing
countries, many low-income countries are not attracting
such flows sufficiently. Aid continues to have an
important role in supporting the efforts of these countries
in creating an enabling environment by improving, <i>inter</i>
<i>alia</i>,
governance,
the
rule
of
law
and
public
accountability.
Furthermore,
official
development
assistance finances development in areas not attractive to
private flows. This applies to capacity-building and to
social sectors such as health and education. The European
Union, which provides more than half of the global
official development assistance, therefore recognizes the
continued need for substantial official development
assistance flows, particularly to the poorest developing
countries.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We need a global discussion on a coherent and
effective response to the opportunities and challenges of
the future. The universality and the broad mandate of the
United Nations make it a unique platform for a dialogue
around the concept of global housekeeping. In this
framework, we believe that the Economic and Social
Council could play a significant role as the central
mechanism in the coordination of United Nations
activities in the economic and social fields. We look
forward to further opportunities for dialogue that may be
offered by such a forum. We also welcome the fact that
the discussion today transcends the strict sphere of
Governments and reaches far into all domains of civil
society. Only thus will it be possible to promote a global
civic ethic necessary to shape the rules which can bring
the benefits of globalization to all of us.
</blockquote>
<p>
Globalization is a reality, not a choice. We are aware
that the poor developing countries are already bearing the
burden of some of its most negative effects. It is urgent that
the international community work closely and purposefully
in order to find answers to the challenges and risks posed
by today's economic realities. The European Union stands
ready to share its experience and to fully engage in the
search for ways to meet these challenges and risks so that
its positive effects and the opportunities that come with it
are shared by the international community.

<p>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): I now
call on Mr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, member of the
Planning Commission and Minister of State of India.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mr. Ahluwalia </b>(India): My delegation would like to
express its appreciation for your insightful remarks,
Mr. President, and for those of the Deputy Secretary-
General, Ms. Louise Fréchette. I would also like to fully
associate my delegation with the statement made on behalf
of the Group of 77 and China.
</p>
<p>
This meeting is taking place at a time when the world
looks very different from the way it did two decades ago,
when the North-South dialogue occupied centre stage. The
group of centrally planned economies has become fully
integrated with world markets, eliminating an important
fault line, which divided the world economy at that time. A
broad consensus has evolved on what economic policies are
likely to work, with a much greater acceptance of the role
of markets and the private sector and the desirability of
open trade and investment policies. The process of
globalization, facilitated by the adoption of more open
economic policies by most countries, has accelerated the
integration of developing countries into the world economy.
Financial liberalization has unleashed an explosion of
private capital flows across national boundaries, adding a
new dimension to the concept of international integration
and interdependence.
</p>
<p>
These forces for integration are potentially positive
developments. It would be comforting if we could also say
that the system is working well and provides an
environment conducive to global economic prosperity in
general and the aspirations of developing countries in
particular. Unfortunately, the long-term development of a
large part of the developing world has actually fallen
behind expectations, and the financial crisis in East Asia,
which has engulfed some of the best performing developing
economies and is having ripple effects on other parts of the
world, has added new worries and uncertainties.
</p>
<blockquote>
Let me elaborate on these two points. As far as
long-term development is concerned, there is no doubt
that significant advances have been made. Some
developing countries, mainly in East Asia, achieved very
high rates of growth over the past two decades,
transforming the living standards of their people. Many
others have made less dramatic, but nevertheless steady,
progress. The relative importance of developing countries
as a group in the world economy, measured in terms of
shares of gross domestic product or world trade, has
clearly increased.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These are important gains, but they do not tell the
full story. Large numbers of developing countries in
Africa, and many in Latin America, have experienced
very low growth in the past two decades. There has been
some improvement in growth performance in recent years,
but it is not a robust revival and is now threatened by the
aftershock of the Asian crisis. Per capita income in many
countries, especially in Africa, is lower than it was in
1980. It used to be thought that poor performance was
due to weaknesses in domestic policies, but this
explanation is less convincing because policies have in
fact converged over the past decade. Furthermore, a large
number of the developing countries experiencing poor
growth have been engaged in structural adjustment
programmes
under the
close supervision of
both
multilateral and bilateral donors, aimed precisely at
aligning their policies with current perceptions of best
practice. This underscores the importance of a more
comprehensive identification of constraints, which are
holding up economic growth in large parts of the
developing world. Some of these constraints are domestic
and have to be addressed by the countries themselves. But
there are also external constraints, which can only be
addressed jointly with the world community, making
continuing dialogue more important than ever before.
Such a dialogue would need to embrace a range of issues.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The first relates to the flow of external financial
resources. The developing countries have consistently
argued that acceleration of development requires a steady
flow of financial resources from the rest of the world.
This requires an increase in official development
assistance, and also flows of long-term non-concessional
resources from multilateral institutions. The story of
official development assistance is well known. Instead of
increasing relative to gross national product to approach
international targets, the percentage has actually declined.
The flow of non-concessional resources from multilateral
institutions such as the World Bank and the regional
development banks has also declined in real terms.
</blockquote>
<p>
These declines would not have mattered if other
sources of finance had been available. Reference is often
made in this context to the growth of private capital flows.
There is no doubt that globalization has led to a remarkable
growth in private capital flows to developing countries; the
scale of these flows now dwarfs the flow of official
assistance. However, private flows are not a substitute for
official flows in all cases. For one thing, they are
concentrated in about a dozen countries; there is no doubt
that a very large number of developing countries will not be
able to benefit from these flows, and for these countries an
expansion in official flows is clearly essential. Even
countries which can attract private capital must recognize
that some of these flows are potentially volatile and can
present problems. As the East Asian crisis amply
demonstrates, private financial markets are vulnerable to
sudden changes of perception and confidence often
triggered by contagion arising from problems elsewhere.
They are also liable to overshooting because of herd
instincts leading to excess inflows in certain circumstances
and large outflows in others. This can subject developing
countries to sudden and destabilizing behaviour, which they
are ill equipped to handle.
</p>
<p>
Developing countries would therefore be well advised
to concentrate on inflows of foreign direct investment,
which is typically long-term, and to take a more cautious
approach to short-term flows. In these circumstances, even
developing countries which can attract private flows would
be helped by a substantial continuing flow of long-term
funds from multilateral institutions. This would act as a
stabilizing element in the capital account. Premature
graduation from multilateral flows may not therefore be
desirable, especially if it is these flows that have to be
activated in times of crisis. Private flows also cannot meet
the financing needs of certain sectors, such as the social
sectors, environmental protection and certain types of
infrastructure. At a time when an international consensus
has been forged through a series of high-level United
Nations conferences and summits on a priority agenda in
social development, protection of the environment, <i>et</i>
<i>cetera</i>, it is essential to ensure an adequate flow of public
resources to achieve these shared objectives. For all these
reasons, serious consideration must be given to expanding
the flow of official resources to developing countries,
including especially flows from multilateral institutions.
</p>
<p>
Developing countries trying to pursue open economic
policies need also to be assured of access to markets in
industrialized countries. The early exponents of export-
oriented industrialization faced a relatively benign climate
in this respect. But with the advance of globalization and
</p>
<blockquote>
the persistence of high rates of unemployment in many
industrialized countries, protectionist voices are heard
more often in the industrialized world. There is much that
is lacking in the international trading system from the
point of view of developing countries. Areas of special
interest to the developing countries, such as textiles and
agriculture, remain subject to protectionist barriers with
phase-outs promised only over relatively long periods.
Even where markets are theoretically open, developing
countries face frequent anti-dumping actions which are
difficult to counter and in any case always expensive and
time-consuming. Efforts are also being made to introduce
environmental conditions and social issues such as labour
standards into the trade agenda. From the perspective of
developing countries, these actions are seen as thinly
disguised protectionism. If developing countries are to
follow open economic policies in these turbulent times, as
they are trying to do, they need greater confidence in a
shared commitment to establishing trading rules that are
fair to them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These are the long-term issues. We must also
address the more urgent concerns raised by the Asian
currency crisis, which has shaken confidence in the
stability of the international financial system and our
ability to manage crises once they erupt. Several features
of the crisis are relevant in this context. First, it was not
anticipated by any of the participants in the international
financial system, casting doubt both on the quality of the
market intelligence on the basis of which private sector
participants take decisions and on the quality of
surveillance exercised by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). Secondly, the crisis has proved difficult to manage
partly because contagion effects spread the crisis to other
countries, but, more important, because the usual
prescriptions either proved ineffective or involved a much
longer transition, with greater loss of output and greater
social distress than was envisaged initially. This has
provoked considerable rethinking on what should be the
ideal design of programmes to manage crises in future.
Finally, the possibility of extended contagion effects
beyond the Asian region, combined with the limitations
on the resources available to the IMF for handling a large
number of crises simultaneously, raises fears that the
international financial system is inherently unstable. The
threat of a worldwide deflationary spiral looms large.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Recognizing
these
problems,
the
international
community
is
currently
engaged
in
defining
an
appropriate architecture for the international financial
system which could increase confidence in its stability.
Some elements of this architecture are indisputable. There
</blockquote>
<p>
is need for much better regulation and supervision of the
financial system in all countries, based on a common set of
norms and standards. There is also need for much better
information and transparency. There is also agreement on
the need for more effective surveillance. But many
questions remain unresolved. How can surveillance be made
more symmetric so that it focuses not just on the financial
systems of recipient countries but also on financial
institutions in the capital-exporting countries? Is the present
International Monetary Fund sufficiently equipped to serve
as a lender of last resort in the international financial
system or do we need a somewhat different type of
institution? Is the present system adequate for handling
future crises or do we need other instruments and
mechanisms for crisis management? In particular, how do
we ensure equitable burden-sharing between debtors and
creditors in the event of a crisis? And finally, does full
convertibility of the capital account introduce too much
potential instability in the system, which developing
countries may not be able to handle, and should developing
countries therefore concentrate on liberalizing trade and
direct investment flows as the major sources of benefit
from
integrating
with
the
world
economy,
while
maintaining a more cautious approach to liberalizing capital
flows in general?
</p>
<p>
No consensus has yet been evolved on these questions,
but answers are urgently needed if we are to restore
confidence not just in the international financial system but
also in globalization and liberalization. I hope our
deliberations at these meetings will move us closer to the
answers.
</p>
<p>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): I call
next on His Excellency Mr. Helmut Schäfer, Minister of
State of Germany.

to extend the congratulations of my Government to you,
Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General
Assembly at its fifty-third session. We wish you great

<p>
At the same time, we should also like to support the
statement of the Austrian Presidency of the European
Union.

At the outset of the Fifth United Nations Development
Decade, at a time of increasing liberalization and
globalization, the prospects for further progress in
development are good. More and more countries in all parts

of the world are becoming increasingly integrated into the
global economy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Any failure, however, to make the necessary
structural adjustments in good time can easily lead to
setbacks and crises. That is why it is right to renew the
dialogue on strengthening the forces for global growth
also by continuing and enhancing international economic
cooperation through partnership. The United Nations is an
appropriate forum for this and, in fact, today's discussions
can draw on the debate conducted in recent years in the
Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly,
as well as, in particular, at the series of world conferences
held over the past eight years.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I would like to recall here that the 1996 G-7 summit
in Lyon made a number of important points concerning
the implementation of a new global partnership for
development, which it identified as an ambition for the
twenty-first century. The ideas spelt out by the G-7 on
how this partnership should evolve also reflect the
consensus
that
emerged
from
the
various
world
conferences. The developing countries are held to have a
responsibility for their own development, notably in
providing
conditions
conducive
to
sustainable
development beneficial to their citizens. There is a
recognition that the international community must support
the efforts of the developing countries in a spirit of
common purpose and efficiency. And there is a strong
focus
on
the
important
role
of
the
multilateral
organizations in cooperating with each other and with
bilateral donors.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These principles also inform Germany's economic
and social policy, as well as its development policy. We
agree that sustainable development should be one of the
most important goals of our development policy.
Particularly in an age of wide open global markets,
economic development is sustainable only if due attention
is given to social and ecological concerns. The task of
politics is to set the course and provide an environment
that will also safeguard future needs -- economic,
ecological and social. Effective responses to global
threats, such as a rapidly growing population, over-
exploitation of natural resources and shortages affecting
people in many parts of the world, are possible only if all
three interdependent aspects of sustainable development
are addressed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In the high-ranking segment of the Economic and
Social Council, we have this year conducted an intensive
debate on market access for developing countries and
</blockquote>
<p>
their integration into the world economy. This has served
to highlight the importance of these issues in the
globalization age. One of the things to emerge from those
discussions was that, as the world becomes increasingly
globalized, promoting private enterprise has a pivotal role
to play. This, then, is now an integral part, a key aspect, of
German economic and development strategy. Enhancing
productive skills to remove the structural causes of poverty
will, in the medium and long terms, help dismantle and
overcome obstacles to development that often hinder the
integration of poor countries into the global economy.
</p>
<p>
Our strategy for promoting private enterprise in
partner countries is based on our own experience that the
successful development of the private sector cannot be
achieved
solely
by
instituting
government
policies
favourable to the growth of a market economy nor by
setting up effective and independent institutions to run the
private sector's own affairs, nor even by developing
innovative entrepreneurial structures. What is in fact needed
is a combination of all three. We see development
cooperation as harnessing economic and development policy
goals.
</p>
<p>
Let me, in this context, also mention the heavy debt
burden of quite a few countries, which all too often is a
serious obstacle to their further development. Germany
strongly endorses assistance to highly indebted poor
countries and has already made a substantial contribution to
reducing their debt burden. Bilaterally, we have thus
implemented or pledged debt cancellation vis-à-vis least
developed countries in Africa. Furthermore, Germany has
participated in multilateral debt-rescheduling arrangements
with developing countries arising from commercial credits.
We have cancelled more than $7 billion in various kinds of
debts. Additionally, we have, since 1978, provided non-
repayable grants to least developed countries, also
amounting to about $7 billion. From the very beginning,
Germany has also been actively involved in the formulation
and evolution of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt
Initiative, which includes all the elements to resolve the
debt problems of these countries, including ambitious and
sustained economic policy reforms in the debtor countries
themselves. For Germany, the link between adequate
economic policy reform and debt relief is of fundamental
importance.
</p>
<p>
Market reforms, functioning financial and capital
markets, thriving foreign trade, together with the growth of
a middle class, are essential elements of balanced, healthy,
internationally competitive economic development and the
basis for further integration into the world economy. The
</p>
<blockquote>
pace of economic activity in the emerging markets shows
what dynamic forces can be unleashed through expanding
trade and incentives to private investors. However, the
Asian crisis, as mentioned earlier today, has also
highlighted structural weaknesses in the process of
development. Clearly, it is imperative to put the
institutional framework in place to ensure sound economic
growth also in the longer term. We see it as one of the
preeminent tasks of bilateral and multilateral development
cooperation to support our partners, especially in their
efforts in this area.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The instruments of national policy are no longer
effective in dealing with what are essentially transnational
developments. The question is whether, and if so, what
kind of national or multilaterally agreed intervention in
the market is justified. Is it possible, for example, to
establish better crisis prevention mechanisms? We have to
deal with this question very thoroughly here.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Seen in this light, then, our dialogue here, and
especially in the relevant technical bodies, is all the more
relevant. We need to consider in what areas international
standards should be established or further developed, not
in order to curb the dynamism of economic forces or
impose rigid rules, but to allow action to be taken to
prevent crises arising.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Germany,
like
many
other
countries,
has
considerable experience in the field of monetary and
credit policy, public supervision of banking and insurance,
the stock exchange business and financial policy, as well
as in national and European law on competition. At the
World Trade Organization we advocate the development
of a set of global trade and competition norms.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Solving these problems will require a greater degree
of international cooperation in the forthcoming century.
An important focus of such concerted efforts will be to
establish more effective cooperative structures and
management. Certainly, in this context we also need to
review the structure and role of the United Nations. In his
reform proposals put forward last year, the Secretary-
General addressed these issues and outlined his vision of
a world Organization that can give its members the
support they need to successfully tackle the global
challenges ahead. This, too, should be part of the dialogue
on which we are embarked.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): I now
call on Mr. J. Brian Atwood, Administrator of the United
States Agency for International Development.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mr. Atwood </b>(United States of America): The United
States delegation welcomes the opportunity to participate in
this important and timely discussion of issues that concern
all of us as we face a period of unusually intense economic
turmoil and uncertainty. I was listening carefully to the
statements that have been made previously, and I must say
that this is a very constructive beginning for this
conference. I and members of my delegation look forward
to the round-table discussions and further discussions of
these issues.
</p>
<p>
I want to recognize one very distinguished member of
the United States delegation, a person who has participated
in and witnessed the evolution of the international system
over the past 50 years: Senator Claiborne Pell, the former
Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</p>
<p>
The crisis in Asia is taking a toll on the very proud
and hardworking peoples of that region, peoples whose
prodigious accomplishments over the past several decades
have earned our deep respect. We must join those
Governments in a commitment to ensure that the
investments we have all made in development are not lost.
</p>
<p>
In Russia, too, we are witnessing the drama of
courageous and talented people struggling with the
complexities of a difficult but necessary transformation to
a market-based economy. Countries, including the United
States, whose economies had decades or centuries to
gradually put in place the markets and the related legal and
regulatory
institutions
should
not
underestimate
the
tremendous challenges facing Russia.
</p>
<p>
As the world contemplates these events, some are
questioning the desirability of free markets and the
increasing interdependence of national economies following
in the wake of what has come to be known as globalization.
Even in the United States, some want to turn back the clock
and return to what they remember as a more bucolic and
self-reliant time. Such isolation is more blissful in nostalgic
recall than in the hard facts. For example, the average
American at the beginning of this century had a shorter life
expectancy than the average person in the developing world
today, and he or she had only slightly more wealth than the
average person in the developing world today.
</p>
<p>
We should not allow the problems we are facing today
to define the meaning of globalization. The benefits still
vastly outweigh the costs. Globalization also means the
availability of cheap and rapid communications, cost-
effective transportation systems and open markets that make
possible the global dissemination of ideas, technology and
</p>
<blockquote>
investment. These benefits of our modern world can make
people more productive as workers and more informed
and capable as citizens. Globalization spurs creativity by
widening the market for innovation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It
can
also
stimulate
competition
among
Governments to become more efficient, to develop their
nations' human capacities or their national financial,
political and legal systems. This sense of the need to
compete,
when
combined
with
a
more
effective
international effort to help especially the poorer countries
achieve sustainable development, can produce the growing
and stable global economy we all seek.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In a globalized world, Governments must recognize
that they have less control over their country's economic
trends. Still they can create a favourable environment for
investment, for capital inflows and for increased
productivity. They have to create confidence for investors.
If, instead, their actions create fear, their countries will be
relegated to watching growth take place elsewhere.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We need to put the current crisis in its proper
perspective by understanding the tremendous gains in the
global economy in the past 50 years, precisely as a result
of successful development efforts and globalization. Even
amidst the current gloom, I do not believe that the
dynamic nations of Asia would want to go back to where
they were two or three decades ago. Their temporary
downturn does not fundamentally alter their long-term
growth path or their bright prospects for the future.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We are already beginning to see signs of an Asian
revival. Exchange rates have stabilized in Thailand and
Korea, allowing interest rates to come down, and
production
is
beginning
to
level
off.
These
accomplishments would not have been possible without
strong,
democratically
elected
leadership
and
the
determined pursuit of policy reforms; and they would not
have been possible had these countries not invested over
the years in their own people's education, health care and
productive capacity.

<p>
In a speech to the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned
Movement in Durban three weeks ago, South Africa's
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki spoke eloquently of the new
forces
sweeping
through
the
global
economy --
globalization, liberalization, deregulation and pervasive
information flows. These forces, he said, represent the
international context in which all of us have to work to
eliminate poverty in our countries. He went on to point out
that the very fact of globalization, in all its forms, means
that our own success as developing countries cannot be
achieved in conditions of autarchy or self-contained
development. This states the basic proposition clearly. No
nation can isolate itself from these positive forces, nor
should it want to. The countries that embrace globalization
most effectively are the ones that will prosper most in the
years ahead.
</p>
<p>
We must not, however, make the mistake of seeing
globalization as a purely economic process. It must take
place in the right context, one in which people can express
their social and political aspirations and can help shape the
world their children will inherit. Furthermore, economic
growth cannot be pursued at the expense of future
generations. Protection of our environmental resource base
is
essential
if
development
is
to
be
sustainable.
Additionally, we must ensure that nations have our help in
facing this task. The international community -- a phrase
we often use -- should want each individual member of
our community to succeed. We have a common interest in
our collective well-being. Therefore, we must find a new
way to create a safety net that will minimize the risks
associated with globalization and encourage countries to
embrace the concept. We also should examine how the
IMF, international financial institutions and bilateral donors
can improve coordination to provide a rapid response to
crises such as those we have seen in Russia, Mexico and
throughout Asia.
</p>
<p>
The United Nations system has a vitally important role
to play. It can be instrumental in helping nations to create
the environment for successful globalization by promoting
a genuine respect for human rights and core labour
standards -- not only civil and political rights, but the
fundamental human rights of all individuals to progressive
realization of their economic, social, and cultural potential.
</p>
<p>
President Clinton made clear this week, in his remarks
to the Council on Foreign Relations here in New York, that
the United States remains ready to help countries that help
themselves. He proposed six steps to deal with the
immediate global financial crisis: collaboration with other
industrialized democracies to spur economic growth; debt
</p>
<blockquote>
relief for private-sector firms in countries affected by the
crisis; a doubling of World Bank support for social safety
net programmes; activation of the $15 billion IMF
emergency fund to prevent further spread of financial
panic; increased lending by the United States Export-
Import Bank; and, finally, funding by our Congress of the
IMF, a matter that will be decided in the next few weeks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The President also announced two initiatives to
better deal with international economic emergencies in the
future. First, he called for further opening of markets to
expand trade while putting in place safeguards for labour
standards and the environment. Secondly, he called for a
meeting within 30 days of the finance ministers and
central bank directors of the G-7 countries and the key
emerging economies to adapt the international financial
architecture for the problems we face in the twenty-first
century. This is not an endorsement of the current status
quo; this is clearly an indication that we understand the
problems of globalization and that we want to work to fix
those problems. The meeting has already been scheduled.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The United States is determined to remain fully
engaged in the effort to achieve global economic well-
being. We are profoundly connected to the developing
world in a variety of ways -- just look at our citizenry,
if you wish. We realize that maintaining our own
economic
growth
is
one
of
the
most
important
contributions we can make. Last year, the United
States --
with
just
4
per
cent
of
the
world's
consumers -- absorbed fully 20 per cent of developing
country exports. Our trade deficit with the developing
world was $200 billion. American foreign direct
investment in developing countries now totals more than
$150 billion. These are building blocks of a sustainable
and mutually beneficial relationship.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Our bilateral foreign assistance programmes also
contribute to the solutions we seek. The Agency for
International Development is responding to the financial
crisis by helping Governments put in place financial
regulatory systems that can reduce the likelihood of future
panics and improve the ability to manage soundly in
crises. We are actively working in places such as
Indonesia to help provide a safety net for the most
severely affected. We are providing assistance in a
number of countries in the areas of banking, capital
markets, tax policy, privatization, deregulation and sector
reform of various types.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And to bring greater opportunity to Africa, a region
that has yet to benefit fully from globalization, President
</blockquote>
<p>
Clinton has asked our Congress to approve the African
Growth and Opportunity Act.
</p>
<p>
The
Clinton
Administration
understands
the
importance of international leadership on these issues. We
want to do more, and we look forward to working with the
United Nations, the Bretton Woods organizations and the
nations that are feeling the current crisis the most to turn
globalization into a fully positive concept. My delegation
looks forward to hearing from others and to participating
fully in this dialogue.
</p>
<p>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): I call on
Mr. Koichi Haraguchi, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs
of Japan.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mr. Haraguchi </b>(Japan): The most important trends in
the world today are globalization and increasing economic
interdependence. Of course, these trends have been evident
for some time, but they have become more pronounced as
a result of the conclusion of the cold war and the
spectacular development of information technology.
</p>
<p>
For example, it is said that today some $50 billion is
transferred around the world every hour; that is $1.2 trillion
every day, $300 trillion every year. The number of host
computers that support the Internet grew more than forty-
fold in the six years from 1991 to 1997, and that growth
continues.
</p>
<p>
Globalization frees us from the constraints imposed by
our national boundaries. Whereas in the past growth was
often hindered when the necessary capital or technology
was unavailable within a country's borders, that is no
longer the case now that those resources can move freely
across borders to wherever they may be used with the
greatest economic efficiency. The economic miracles that
have occurred in Asia are excellent examples of what
globalization makes possible.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it cannot be denied that in
promoting efficiency through competition, globalization
creates some problems. Enhanced competition produces
losers in a much harsher manner along with winners, and
enlarges the gap between the rich and the poor.
</p>
<p>
Traditional states were characterized by a sense of
solidarity or a feeling of belonging to the same community,
and people managed to balance the drive to increase
efficiency with consideration for the weak -- or, to put it
in more general philosophical terms, to balance the pursuit
of freedom and the pursuit of equality.
</p>
<blockquote>
However, globalization has tended to destroy that
delicate balance. Some developing countries are better
able to take advantage of the opportunities created by
globalization, it is true, but others are in danger of being
left
behind
and
thus
marginalized.
This
can
be
destabilizing and in the long term damaging to the
prosperity of us all.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It should also be recognized that the acceleration of
globalization and the intensification of interdependence
have increased to a great extent the systemic risks the
world faces. Whenever a problem arises in some part of
the world today, there is a danger that it may lead to a
paralysis of the entire system. The contagiousness of the
current financial crisis is a concrete example of what can
happen.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Clearly, the challenge facing us is to derive the
maximum
benefit
from
the
positive
features
of
globalization while avoiding or minimizing the damage
done by its negative features. In order to take advantage
of
the
positive
features,
we
need
to
introduce
internationally recognized rules, such as democratic
procedures, transparency, accountability, the rule of law
and the prevention of corruption. This is the surest way
to promote an inflow of productive resources from
abroad.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
On the other hand, we should also be prepared to
address the negative side of globalization. It is to this end
that Japan has put forward the idea of the New
Development Strategy. The New Development Strategy is
a means of surmounting the problems of development. At
its core, it is the idea that as globalization proceeds, it is
essential that a partnership be formed between recipient
and donor countries and a wider range of international
cooperation pursued, while at the same time the
ownership of the development process by developing
countries must be encouraged.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The
Strategy
also
advocates
combining
a
comprehensive
and
an
individual
approach
to
development. The comprehensive approach stresses the
importance not only of official financial assistance but
also of integrating private investment, trade, market
access,
and
the
development
of
socio-economic
infrastructure into national development strategies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
At the same time, an individual approach is needed
since, despite increasing globalization, the problems this
process causes and the measures that must be taken to
resolve them are not the same for all affected countries.
</blockquote>
<p>
In dealing with the possible systemic risks that
globalization
entails,
international
cooperation
is
indispensable. For example, in view of the devastating
effect the abrupt movement of short-term capital had in the
recent Asian financial crisis, the G-8 leaders in Birmingham
urged the International Monetary Fund to examine how to
monitor effectively capital flows, particularly short-term
flows, to provide information and promote market stability.
We need to undertake such international cooperation in
other fields as well.
</p>
<p>
As I have suggested, globalization creates both
opportunities and challenges. I have touched on how we
should respond to them in general terms. Now I wish to
describe some of the measures Japan itself has been taking.
In response to the economic crisis in Asia, Japan has
provided strong support for the efforts of affected countries
to extricate themselves from the problems besetting them.
These efforts include providing a safety net so that the
weaker members of society, who are bearing more than
their fair share of the pain, do not fall any farther. They
also include developing human resources in order to be
better able to cope with this crisis. Japan is providing $43
billion in such support, making it the largest source of
bilateral assistance.
</p>
<p>
In order to respond to the needs of Africa, where the
possibility of marginalization is most serious, Japan,
together with the rest of the international community, is
embarked on an effort to implement the new development
strategy there. It is as part of that effort that Japan will
convene the Second Tokyo International Conference on
African Development next month in cooperation with the
United Nations and the Global Coalition for Africa. Its
primary theme and objective is "Poverty Reduction and
Integration of Africa into the Global Economy". At the
conclusion of the conference, it is expected that an action
plan will be adopted that will guide us in pursuing African
development effectively as we move towards the twenty-
first century.
</p>
<p>
Japan is of the view that meetings such as this one can
do much to enhance the awareness of people everywhere
with respect to the activities of the United Nations in this
important area. We therefore wish to express the hope that
our efforts here will meet with success.
</p>
<p>
<b>The President </b><i>(interpretation from Spanish)</i>: I now
call on Mr. Dan Abodakpi, Deputy Minister of Trade and
Industry of Ghana.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Mr. Abodakpi </b>(Ghana): It is my great pleasure to
make a contribution to this important process. The theme
of this dialogue really warms my heart, as it relates to the
rapidly evolving twin phenomena of globalization and
interdependence. These processes are resulting in dramatic
changes to international economic and trade relations,
changes that have an impact on all countries, both
developed and developing. Indeed, it is impossible to
forget that the end of this century, particularly the 1990s,
will go down in history as a period of profound changes
in international relations. From the standpoint of trade and
economic relations, the most prominent of those changes
have been the twin processes of globalization and
interdependence. The fact that these processes basically
tend to bring more growth opportunities to all countries
is a great source of satisfaction and hope. But let us not
lose sight of the fact that behind the considerable wave of
applause for these laudable trends are also the risks of
marginalization and uncertainty for developing countries,
particularly those in the sub-Saharan region of Africa.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Globalization
has
come
to
assume
a
more
comprehensive meaning, while interdependence between
nations has grown stronger. Indeed, the processes have
become irreversible and affect all sectors of the universal
economy -- namely, production, investment, employment,
trade, development and the general well-being of people.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The current trend of the global economy, which
continuously gravitates towards more interdependence,
makes it obvious that developing countries have no choice
but
to
integrate
into
the
world
economy.
More
importantly, they must acknowledge that their destinies
are linked to those of other nations. It therefore becomes
quite clear that developing countries have no choice but
to look beyond their borders for more business.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It has been said that globalization enables countries
to seize opportunities irrespective of their degree of
development. What is apparent from this is that the
phenomenon of globalization has the potential to generate
enormous benefits for all countries. In effect, developing
countries, especially African countries, should also find
more scope to grow and prosper.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The beneficial link between the global economy and
the socio-economic consequences for developing countries
appears to me to be that of more broadly based
development over the medium to long term. By
implication, developing countries, particularly African
countries, should over time largely overcome their social
and economic problems in such areas as population,
</blockquote>
<p>
health and education, as well as trade, investment and
finance.
</p>
<p>
The reality, however, is that the potential benefits will
not come easily and that the phenomenon of the global
economy carries with it considerable risks, frustration and
fear, and I will proceed immediately to elaborate with
particular reference to Africa.
</p>
<p>
A very significant characteristic of the global economy
of late is the boom in the flow of foreign direct investment.
In the <i>1995 World Development Report</i>, it is noted that in
the 1990s, the rate of growth of foreign direct investment
stock has substantially exceeded that of world output (gross
domestic product) and world exports. Clearly, this indicates
that foreign direct investment now plays a very crucial role
in the global economy.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, considerable evidence to indicate
that the global flow of foreign direct investment has not
been evenly distributed. Apart from its over-concentration
in the developed world, as far as the developing world is
concerned, sub-Saharan Africa has in the main been
bypassed. Admittedly, the distribution of foreign direct
investment cannot be equal, but in a situation where only
the 10 largest developing countries account for about two
thirds of the total stock of developing countries' share of
foreign direct investment, resulting in the marginalization
of sub-Saharan Africa, then the benefits of globalization as
far as Africa is concerned appear to be an illusion. Statistics
indicate that in 1994, the total value of foreign direct
investment in sub-Saharan Africa was a meagre $1.86
billion, which was only the amount of the flows to New
Zealand.
</p>
<p>
Another
important
characteristic
of
the
global
economy, especially in the 1990s, has been the intensity of
competition, with countries trying hard to outpace each
other in the international market place. This has been the
case particularly since the Uruguay Round of Multilateral
Trade Negotiations. Admittedly, the Uruguay Round
constitutes one successful, good example of a global
attempt at restructuring world trade. It has been hailed as a
truly
remarkable
achievement
by
the
international
community. Given its outcome, I may say that new
horizons for the promotion of our mutual trade have been
opened.
</p>
<p>
It is pertinent to remind ourselves that the benefits of
the Uruguay Round will not flow automatically to countries
and that it is only the dynamic economies that adjust
adequately to the new order that stand to benefit.
</p>
<blockquote>
Unfortunately, sub-Saharan Africa constitutes a region
whose trade structure is characterized by a high
dependence on a narrow range of primary commodities as
the main export items, and which has persistent balance
of payment deficits and mounting foreign debt. It is also
the region in which the prospects for trade creation and
increased participation in global trade remain inadequate,
while institutional frameworks for the implementation of
the results of the Uruguay Round remain weak and are
sometimes non-existent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Superimposed
on
these
difficulties
are
the
fundamental development issues, such as halting rapid
population growth and the creation of human skills --
especially sufficient technical cadres -- as well as
improved health care. In all these areas, sub-Saharan
Africa trails dismally behind other regions of the
developing world. For sub-Saharan Africa, the sense of
risks and uncertainties is not, therefore, unfounded. By
every
standard,
the
prospects
for
Africa
appear
frightening.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Given these features of sub-Saharan Africa, it is
proper to ask whether the processes of globalization and
interdependence will be good and therefore facilitate the
region's ultimate development. The answer to that
question may still be positive. I say that because African
countries are still optimistic about the long-term benefits
of globalization. More than ever before, African countries,
including Ghana, have acknowledged the need to mobilize
resources more effectively, invigorate their development
and exploit some of the numerous global opportunities for
their well-being. Most, if not all, sub-Saharan African
countries
are
therefore
pursuing
growth-oriented
adjustment programmes to ensure their early integration
into the global economy. The specifics are so well
documented that I do not intend to spend time elaborating
any further.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is important, however, to note that it has been a
Herculean task to maintain the momentum of these
programmes, particularly with the entry of democratic
Governments into most of Africa. Public opinion, and
both internal and outside pressures, have the potential to
compromise or slow down the pace of the implementation
of programmes. In spite of the efforts by African
countries to improve their economic standing, the risks of
marginalization remain, even at this stage when their
recovery programmes are yielding tangible results.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We may ask, "Can the African economic crisis
end?" Yet again, the answer is positive. The African
</blockquote>
<p>
efforts, if spurred on by specific programmes by the
developed partners, will certainly serve as sufficient
calming factors to facilitate the continent's economic
growth. Indeed, the modest recovery of African economies
should serve to whet the appetite for extensive assistance.
Sub-Saharan African countries require a major push to
supplement their efforts at reversing the downturn of their
economies. Certainly, there is a powerful case for providing
special programmes specifically for Africa in critical areas
such as resources for development, international trade and
technology transfer. Such programmes will maximize the
potential gains from our structural adjustment and growth-
oriented strategies. It is in this context that we welcome the
initiative of the Government of the United States, the
African Growth and Opportunity Act.
</p>
<p>
In all these cases, the commitment of the international
community to fully play its role within the framework of
global cooperation is critical. While African countries
commit themselves to pushing through the necessary sound
economic policies with zeal, it will be equally important for
the rest of the world to complement those efforts through
unhindered access to markets and the extension of adequate
financial assistance on appropriate terms. In this way, our
partners in the global economy will live up to their
responsibility to help those African countries which are
making such tremendous efforts to follow the principles of
market orientation and the reinforcement of democracy in
all its forms.
</p>
<p>
On the nagging issue of African debt, I note that
African countries still have a long way to go, in spite of the
strategies and policies they already have in place to meet
the attendant obligations. I urge a more durable solution
through, <i>inter alia</i>, more debt reduction, as well as
refinancing. Industrialized countries may wish to consider
the cancellation of all official bilateral debts owed by sub-
Saharan African countries.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the overall net transfer of resources to
Africa should be enhanced. Indications point to the fact
that, for some time, official aid will have to increase to
sustain Africa's development. An aid programme generous
enough to ensure sufficient official development assistance
to Africa will go a long way in contributing to sustainable
economic development.
</p>
<p>
On international trade, there is an urgent need for
Africa to break away from its overdependence on a few
export items. What is required in that respect is a well-
focused programme to facilitate the development of an
expanded and diversified value-added export drive, taking
</p>
<blockquote>
advantage of the increasing market openings that are
emerging as a result of globalization and the liberalization
of world trade.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I find it pertinent also to stress the important role of
technological innovation, which, as we are all aware, is
seriously altering the distribution of economic activity and
has turned into a key factor in determining the
competitiveness of countries in trade. Preferential and
concessional access to technology for sub-Saharan Africa
will go a long way towards bringing efficiency to its
industry.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Underlying all these efforts is the important factor of
human capital. In this area, too, Africa is deficient and
lags dismally behind other regions of the world. Sub-
Saharan Africa has to be aided to develop adequate
internal capacity for policy work.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In conclusion, I will say that, today, Africa's
development problems are immense and complex, and
require urgent attention. Simply put, the argument for
helping the continent now is that this would give it a
chance of steadying and improving the conditions
necessary for accelerated development. A buoyant Africa
playing its fair role in the global economy will be
mutually beneficial to all countries.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We should never lose sight of the essential
objectives
and
benefits
of
globalization
and
interdependence: prosperity and better living conditions
for people in all walks of life. We must broaden our
vision towards the achievement of this vital goal to ensure
greater welfare for all.

level dialogue and reiterates its unswerving commitment
to strengthening international cooperation for development
through partnership.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The phenomenon of globalization, in all its diversity,
is a reality that cannot be ignored. A world of destinies
that exclude others is no longer possible or desirable.
Globalization
engenders
opportunities
that
the
international community must pursue with creativity. But
at the same time it has adverse effects that require timely
responses and strategies. To this end, Mexico has

<p>
supported
the
adoption
of
measures
to
revitalize
international cooperation for development and to combat
poverty. Here Mexico speaks out for shared international
responsibility vis-à-vis the risks and opportunities of global
integration in finance and trade.
</p>
<p>
The voices united in this urgent call are many and
important, for the latest events in the international economy
clearly underline the enormous challenge confronting the
international community: in an era of globalization, the
economic crisis too is becoming global. The most recent
crisis began in Asia, and despite the great efforts deployed
by the affected countries and the cooperation of the
international financial community, the crisis has spread to
other parts of the world.
</p>
<p>
At the beginning, it was a financial crisis. But now it
is severely affecting international trade. It has also
depressed
to
historically
low
levels
the
prices
of
commodities as fundamental as oil, minerals and basic
grains. Instability and inefficient functioning of, and
speculation in, the financial markets have caused a trend
towards recession on a global scale, seriously hampering
the
economic
development
prospects
of
developing
countries.
</p>
<p>
All this calls for committed international cooperation
to strengthen the world economic architecture. It is urgent
that the developed countries take all the measures needed
to revitalize world economic growth with stability in the
financial markets. It is also clear that the Bretton Woods
institutions, particularly the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank, must adapt in order to be in a
position to confront in an effective and timely manner the
monetary, financial and development challenges offered by
a crisis induced by large-scale movements of capital.
</p>
<p>
We are increasingly convinced that transparency and
good management of the monetary, financial and trade
systems at the international level are of the utmost
importance. The international institutions must match the
efforts of our countries by launching a fundamental review
of their organizations, policies, conditionalities, procedures
and financial capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Mexico has had to respond in a timely and firm
manner to the enormous economic policy challenges that
we faced in December 1994 and again since the first
months of this year. Mexico's strategy in tackling the
economic emergency of 1995 attained its objectives. Thanks
to the efforts of the entire Mexican people, and with
international cooperation, it was possible to start the
</p>
<blockquote>
economic recovery just as planned. But again, over the
past year, globalization factors have had a negative impact
on Mexico, whose economy has suffered external shocks,
such as the volatility of capital flows, the sharp fall of oil
prices and the Russian crisis.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The Mexican Government, however, has reiterated
its commitment to continue to conduct its economic
policy responsibly in order to ensure stability and growth.
Measures must also be adopted on an international scale
to
prevent
the
international
financial
crisis
from
deteriorating into a world recession.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Parallel to this urgent and very decisive action, there
is a need for continued work in the following areas:
strengthening North-South and South-South cooperation;
reversing the trend towards reduced financial assistance
for development, and ensuring predictable, continuous and
reliable assistance flows; enhancing access by developing
countries to global markets, direct investment flows and
technological transfers; and providing lasting solutions to
the external debt problems of the developing countries.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Mexico
attaches
high
priority
to
systematic,
comprehensive, high-level international intergovernmental
consideration of financing for development, as proposed
by the General Assembly. This will give us the
opportunity to ensure that we have the necessary means
to promote international cooperation in a context of
solidarity and shared responsibility.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Globalization is a reality, not a problem or a
conspiracy. It is a new expression of an interdependence
in which we all share responsibilities and commitments.
If we act boldly, with resolve and in a timely manner, we
will be able to take full advantage of the benefits of
global integration and swiftly overcome its negative
effects.

to exchange views and to foster a fruitful and constructive
dialogue based not on confrontation but on shared
responsibility and genuine partnership, which should lead to
more meaningful cooperation for development.
</p>
<p>
Although there has been no agreed definition of
globalization,
there
is
a
wide
understanding
that
globalization, as an accelerated economic activity across
national political boundaries, finding expression in the
increased movement of goods and services, reflects not only
trade transactions, but touches upon every aspect of the
economy, notably flows of capital and foreign direct
investment, technology transfers, employment, labour
mobility and even the cultural life of a nation.
</p>
<p>
The forces of this phenomenon have wrought dramatic
changes on the global economic scene, giving rise to vast
opportunities as well as to grave challenges and risks. For
the majority of developing countries that do not compete to
integrate their economies with the global economy,
globalization represents enormous uncertainties to their
endeavours to achieve social and economic progress. With
their access to markets, financial flows and technology
severely limited, their economic growth has been stifled.
Moreover, in the process of international economic
decision-making, where their participation could enable
them to obtain redress for their situation, developing
countries are not participating. This trend needs to be
reversed.
</p>
<p>
To give impulse to a new scheme of relations, we
must come forward with an agenda that is sensitive to the
concerns of both sides. There is, fortunately, considerable
policy coherence and no ideological divide. The main
element we developing countries need to get factored in is
our development stage and how we may more equitably
participate in the global economy from this aspect. To
manage the emerging realities, the social and economic
impacts of globalization, our strategy should focus on
interconnecting efforts undertaken at the national and
international levels.
</p>
<p>
To adjust to the new forces of integration, Egypt, like
many other developing countries, has recognized that its
basic growth impulses must be founded on their economies
and that self-reliance and national effort are imperative in
the global context. A wide range of reform and structural
</p>
<blockquote>
adjustment policies have been adopted, often at high
social cost. In addition to pursuing economic growth,
priority is given to a people-centred development,
reducing poverty and increasing productive employment.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Our
future
relations
must
reflect
the
credit
developing countries have earned by pursuing such
policies. To this end, the developed world must set the
example of genuine liberalization by facilitating market
access in sectors of export interest to developing countries
and areas where the latter possess a competitive
advantage, such as agriculture and textiles. Developing
countries must be given support in respect of new
disciplines where they are to acquire competition by
extending the concept of a generalized system of
preferences. It is necessary to resist the protectionist
demands of those opposed to competition and fully
preserve the letter and spirit of multilateralism. This
means preventing the use of countervailing duties and
anti-dumping measures.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
While liberalization is expanding, it is unfortunate
that we continue to witness with perplexity the operation
of the greatest protectionist apparatus ever put in place by
some countries for the preservation of one sector --
agriculture -- and to prevent it from being exposed to
competition.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Given the importance of private capital flows for
development and the growing integration of developing
countries in the international financial markets, there is a
need for a new approach to managing this sector,
particularly
after
the
recent
disturbances
in
the
international financial and capital markets that have
severely affected many countries in Asia and other parts
of the world. The international monetary and financial
system needs to be adapted and reviewed in order to
increase confidence in the system. We need to engage, as
a first step, in a study of the underlying global causes of
the crisis and how best to safeguard against future
occurrences.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Developing countries are also facing obstacles to
possessing technology at a time when this is crucial to
their development and to their becoming competitive in
the global market. They are almost exclusively buyers of
technology and the present world intellectual property
system of patents, trademarks and copyrights gives the
industrialized world monopolistic power in the markets.
We need to reflect on ways to facilitate easy access to
technology on affordable terms.
</blockquote>
<p>
Changes in the relative importance of production
factors, which imply a move from material labour-intensive
products to knowledge-intensive products have meant a loss
of comparative advantage for the developing countries. This
shift has given rise to increased unemployment, with all its
adverse effects. In addition to adopting specific policies, it
is fundamental to tackle structural questions related to job
opportunity, which can no longer be viewed only from the
standpoint of national realities.
</p>
<p>
The imperatives for moving towards a system that
could equitably deal with the increasing integration of the
world are becoming stronger. A world in which one quarter
of the people is affluent and three quarters are deprived
hardly offers an enduring basis for global peace and
security. Spurring economic growth in the developing
countries, with their significant potentials in production and
purchasing power, is certainly in the interests of the global
economy as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Our collective security lies in building conversions
among nations and peoples on the logic of the mutual
benefits of a balanced international economic system. We
should be ready to assume responsibilities, each according
to its capacities, in the context of a global strategy
eventually leading to a positive-sum game between all
countries, with the vigorous assistance of the United
Nations.
</p>
<p>
Finally, let me express my fervent hope that our
dialogue today will become truly a force multiplier for
development cooperation.
</p>
<p>
<b>The President </b><i>(interpretation from Spanish)</i>: I now
give the floor to Mr. Leiv Lunde, State Secretary for
International Cooperation and Human Rights of Norway.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mr. Lunde </b>(Norway): Let me first of all underline
how much I appreciate being able to take part in this
debate. The question of globalization and development is
indeed a topical issue in which dialogue between the North
and the South is essential for meeting our common
challenges.
</p>
<p>
It is therefore with great interest that we noted the
focus on this issue at the recent summit of the Non-Aligned
Movement in Durban. In their final document, the Heads of
State and Government of the Movement point to the
ambiguity
of
the
processes
of
globalization
and
liberalization, noting that, while these trends were expected
to lead to increased economic opportunities for developing
economies, a large number of developing countries continue
</p>
<blockquote>
to be marginalized and thus unable to share the benefits
of the global economy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In my view, it is clear that the greatest benefits of
globalization have so far been garnered by a rather small
minority, while many are worse off than before. The gap
between those living in affluence and those suffering the
hardship of poverty is growing, both within nations and
between them. The assumption that globalization is a
process that benefits everyone has proved to be utterly
untrue.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In the wake of the Asian financial crisis we have
seen unemployment soar, living standards plummet and
expectations of a better life shattered -- not only in Asia,
but all over the world. The Asian crisis clearly illustrates
the shift in economic power away from national
Governments to stock markets and other actors with little,
or at least unclear, responsibility for the common good.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The reduced significance of national boundaries also
represents a challenge to national identities, traditions and
culture. To many the process of globalization has led to
reduced cultural variation and increased economic
inequality, instead of increased cultural variation and
reduced economic inequality, as had been hoped.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Many of the menaces facing us have become truly
globalized. Financial crises, environmental degradation,
the spread of disease, violent conflicts and organized
crime and terrorism are affecting us all, regardless of
where we live on this shrinking planet. To overcome
these threats, some people are prescribing a recipe of
protectionism and isolation. But is this really a viable
alternative in a world where ideas and financial
transactions travel round the globe in seconds, where help
is available only to those with something to offer in the
global marketplace and where many of the challenges we
are faced with are of such a magnitude that no country,
not even the most powerful, can tackle them alone?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
My Government does not believe this to be the case.
There is no way back to yesterday's world, where trade,
travel and transactions across borders were much more
limited. The processes of economic, cultural and
technological globalization cannot be reversed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But the globalization process can and must be
managed.
Better
management
of
the
forces
of
globalization at both the national and the international
level is the only way to proceed if we are to maximize
</blockquote>
<p>
the positive effects of an integrated world, while
minimizing its negative aspects.
</p>
<p>
At the national level we must invest in both human
resources and physical infrastructure and promote good
governance, democracy and human rights. The prospects for
the next century depend above all on our willingness and
ability to make the necessary long-term social investments,
particularly in health and education. The investment base
must be broad. The creative potential of society will be
fully unleashed only if we are all stockholders in the
development process.
</p>
<p>
The forces of globalization challenge the sovereignty
of individual States, but they will never make them
redundant -- quite the contrary. The market has an
important role to play in allocating resources as effectively
as possible, thus increasing the volume of funds available
for social and environmental concerns. But resources do not
by any means flow automatically to meet such common
needs, nor to care for the most vulnerable groups in society.
Vigorous governmental policies are therefore called for to
ensure that resource allocations meet the demands of the
people to whom Governments are responsible.
</p>
<p>
Internationally, there is no alternative to strengthening
multilateralism. We must further improve decision-making
procedures at the international level. We must create a
world order based on law and contract, where solidarity and
social responsibility are not limited by national boundaries,
but stretch across borders and continents.
</p>
<p>
With one of the most open economies in the world,
Norway has greatly benefited from the development of a
global economy. But we have also experienced how
external, anonymous forces have contributed to make jobs
vanish overnight and ruin dreams and expectations. Against
this background there has been considerable political debate
in my country about how globalization can be managed for
the common good. My Government will, in the next few
months, be arranging national and international meetings in
an effort to increase our common understanding of the
various features and challenges of globalization. We must
ensure that globalization serves our interests and that it does
not become our master.
</p>
<p>
One of the most pressing dangers of globalization is
the increased marginalization of the least developed
countries. Many of the world's poorest nations are hardly
in a position to benefit from the global economy. These
countries receive minimal foreign investment and lack a
dynamic private sector as a basis for employment and
</p>
<blockquote>
growth. Furthermore, they are often deprived of the
benefits of increased export earnings due to heavy debt
burdens and closed markets in Western countries.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Although the prime responsibility for development
lies with the leadership of any country, which must
ensure political stability and sound macroeconomic
policies, the international community has an obligation to
assist. We cannot, yet again, allow ourselves to stand by
and see the weakest among us being left behind.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is a regrettable fact that the industrialized
countries are increasingly distancing themselves from the
agreed United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross
national product for development purposes. Norway is
going in the opposite direction, and we have plans for a
further increase in our official development assistance,
which is already well above the United Nations target.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We believe that international debt relief schemes
must be improved, as has been stressed by many other
speakers today, and we are doing our part through a
newly launched national debt relief plan to better assist
heavily indebted poor countries. We are also currently
finalizing a strategy for private sector development in
developing countries. But, above all, we are actively
seeking to counter the widespread and growing donor
fatigue and striving to make multilateral organizations
more sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the
developing world.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
At the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Durban,
the heads of State and Government reaffirmed that there
is no alternative to a constructive dialogue between
developed and developing countries if we are to reap the
benefits of globalization while effectively meeting its
challenges. The United Nations is an important forum for
addressing the challenges of globalization. It belongs to
us all. It is unique and indispensable. It is our repository
of hope for a better future. Let us support it, make it
more efficient and place it at the heart of our efforts to
derive the very best from the globalization processes,
particularly for those who need it most.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): I now
call on Ms. Huguette Labelle, President of the Canadian
International Development Agency.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Ms. Labelle </b>(Canada): It is a distinct pleasure to be
here today to represent my country, Canada. I believe that
this meeting provides a valuable and very timely
opportunity for us all to better understand this pervasive
</blockquote>
<p>
phenomenon called globalization. I am looking forward to
what I am sure will be constructive and frank exchanges on
how globalization is reshaping the whole international
community.
</p>
<p>
There is no doubt that globalization is the most
important socio-economic phenomenon of this generation.
With every day that passes, trade, technology and the
information age erode our national boundaries and
transform our planet into an enormous metropolis which is
wired together by the Internet, fax and many other things.
The effect has been profound. Many this morning have
been able to paint them in a very vivid way. It has affected
every area of our lives -- the economy, transportation,
government, the media, culture, even personal friendships
and family life.
</p>
<p>
We also know that global power has been more
dispersed than it has been in the past; that globalization is
reflected in the spread of consumerism and in an increased
homogenization of certain aspects of our lives. Yet, for all
this conformity -- and despite the immense wealth
generated by globalization -- we have also heard and seen
that it has been characterized by profound contradictions.
</p>
<p>
It is true that a number of countries have benefited
enormously. It is also true that many others have been
passed by. So while the world is smaller, it has not become
more equitable or necessarily economically and socially
secure. We witnessed this especially in the last months of
last year and then this year.
</p>
<p>
Further, it is all too clear from these events that even
those who have benefited have also fallen prey to the
negative consequences of very rapid globalization, and the
toll has been heavy. Our hope is that, because those
countries have worked so well and so hard in recent
decades, there will not be too important a regression or one
that cannot be reversed very rapidly.
</p>
<p>
As we confront these contradictions, we must be
aware
of
one
other
profound
change
wrought by
globalization: the difference in the power and relevance of
the nation-state, and its obviously diminished ability to
change and guide the course of human events. There is an
increased place in our world, therefore, with all those
countless transactions, for a very different kind of
interrelationship, a different kind of cooperation and a
different kind of support.
</p>
<p>
We have heard this morning about the importance of
being able to minimize the negative sides of globalization
</p>
<blockquote>
and maximize its benefits for all. Many very important
points have been raised that I know will be discussed
during the next two days. I also should like to leave some
points on the table that I think are very closely related to
many of the ones that have already been made.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
First, we hear more and more that we need to
protect ourselves against the volatility of the financial
markets
by,
among
other
things,
enhancing
our
cooperation to deal rapidly with crises as they emerge and
also by improving existing surveillance mechanisms. It
was in this spirit that Canada's Minister of Finance, Paul
Martin, at the spring meetings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), suggested that we all
consider together establishing a peer review mechanism
in close collaboration with the World Bank and the IMF
in order to enhance supervision of the financial sectors of
all of our countries. A working group of the Group of 22
will be meeting next week and will report to the World
Bank and IMF meeting in early October.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A second theme that has been prevalent is that we
need to continue to address with increased vigour the
troika
of
poverty,
environmental
degradation
and
population growth, and in this respect that we must use
every occasion, including this meeting and this year's
session of the General Assembly, to renew our
commitment to the goals that have been arising out of the
United Nations summits of recent years. Of course,
central to these are poverty reduction and enhancing
quality of life for all by providing the social and physical
infrastructure that all countries require.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A third aspect that has been brought up is that the
developing countries themselves have been working very
hard at establishing an enabling environment for
investments to flow to their countries. We know that the
flow of investments has been uneven and that they have
been volatile. However, many, if not all, countries have
to various degrees been trying to establish that enabling
environment and have also been working at strengthening
their application of the rule of law. Canada will continue
to support countries in their efforts and hopes to be able
to enhance that support in this sector.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Fourthly, the issue of debt continues to loom over
many of the poorest countries. In 1989, Canada forgave
its debt loans to sub-Saharan Africa and to some of the
poorest countries of Latin America. We therefore feel that
we are in a good position to support the implementation
of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC)
Initiative, and we remain convinced that together we can
</blockquote>
<p>
continue to improve this mechanism in order to deal with
some of the many issues that people have raised, be it
speed of implementation or other aspects.
</p>
<p>
I think that in dealing with debt we have to be very
careful to look for resources other than public funding,
though I think that is important, in the quest to develop
countries' physical infrastructure, so that we do not create
a new wave of debt over the next decade that will come
back to haunt us. I feel very optimistic, therefore, about
mixed public and private-sector funding, both bilateral and
multilateral, but I would inject a note of caution as to how
it is done.
</p>
<p>
I think one clear aspect that has emerged in the last
few years is how important it is for all countries to work
very closely together and for the developing countries to be
at the centre of their development. We must therefore
continue to remind ourselves of that fact and to find new
approaches to working together in full respect of that very
important concept.
</p>
<p>
The future may be impossible to predict, but it is not
predetermined. Our hope is that the next millennium will be
one of humanism and one in which the United Nations will
play a vital role in shaping that future.
</p>
<p>
<b>The President </b>(<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>): I give
the floor to Mr. Carlos Dotres Martínez, the Minister for
Public Health of Cuba.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mr. Martínez </b>(Cuba) (<i>interpretation from Spanish</i>):
I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your recent
election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the
General Assembly, and to wish you success in your work.
I wish also to associate myself with the statement made by
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of
Indonesia, Mr. Ali Alatas, the Chairman of the Group of 77
and China.
</p>
<p>
It is clear that globalization is an objective fact. It is
also clear that, as stated just a few days ago by the Non-
Aligned Movement at its summit meeting, while the process
in which the world is now engaged provides opportunities,
it is also having adverse economic and social consequences
which add to the burden of everyday life in the countries of
the South.
</p>
<p>
The recent Non-Aligned Movement Declaration for the
New Millennium, adopted at Durban, rightly indicates that
we must guard against forms of globalization which impose
solutions
that
ignore
the
historical,
cultural
and
</p>
<blockquote>
psychological elements peculiar to national and local
economies. That Declaration goes on to warn that
globalization must not sweep all before it, that it must not
mean uniformity and that its impact must be channelled
not just by the large and powerful nations but by the
representatives of the majority of humankind.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Some argue -- and it is undeniable -- that the
globalization process has brought prosperity to some
areas, promoted certain levels of wealth and encouraged
growth in the economies of some countries. However, it
cannot be denied that the same process, by making the
economies of all States and regions more interdependent,
has caused the effects of certain regional crises to spiral,
threatening even the most flourishing economies.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The
globalization
of
information
and
the
dissemination of knowledge make positive contributions,
but they are not without hazards and challenges, because
they establish single standards aimed at making the
behaviour of entire nations conform to the ideologies and
models that the powerful economies consider to be
paradigms.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But the most dangerous element in the current
processes of globalization is their selectivity. They help
certain economies, but a large part of the world remains
mired in the most abject poverty, deriving little or no
benefit from the increased exchanges and flourishing
markets so much talked about by the apologists for
neoliberalism.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A typical example is provided by Africa, many of
whose countries are left out of the currents of growth that
other areas enjoy. Those countries do not attract global
interest, except when they are provided with so-called
humanitarian assistance in response to fratricidal wars,
great famines or cyclical droughts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But it is not only Africa. Let us take a look at the
other third world regions, where from a statistical
standpoint many societies seem to have progressed.
Economic growth rates are high, but there are enormous
segments of population in which life below the poverty
line is an ordinary phenomenon.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We observe today -- every day -- a growing feeling
of uncertainty and frustration, as human beings are unable
to control their own lives or the environment they must
inhabit. The developmental disparity between North and
South shows shocking differences in the nineties, with the
South always at a disadvantage. For example, life
</blockquote>
<p>
expectancy at birth is 11.7 years less; per capita calorie
consumption is 25 per cent less; the infant mortality rate is
higher by 61 per thousand live births; 32 per cent less of
the population has access to potable water; and there are 72
fewer scientists and technicians for every thousand
inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
In the 1997 United Nations Development Programme
<i>Human Development Report</i>, the following data stand out:
507 million people will not live to the age of 40; 800
million people do not have access to health services; and 17
million of the developing world's inhabitants die every year
from curable contagious and parasitic diseases, such as
diarrhoea, malaria and tuberculosis. Of the 23 million
people in the world who are infected with AIDS, more than
90 per cent live in developing countries. In sub-Saharan
Africa, 65 million hectares of productive lands have
become desert in the last 50 years.
</p>
<p>
Because of the arms race, world peace and stability
have also become global issues, and the mammoth military
expenditures continue to be crimes of omission against
humanity's development and health. Let me give an
example. With the money it costs to build one nuclear
aircraft carrier, it would be possible to buy 3,500 to 4,000
pieces of nuclear magnetic resonance equipment for
diagnoses, or 20,000 cobalt pumps for cancer treatment. In
many ways, the world is going through the current age of
globalization without a clear goal and without knowing the
terrain.
</p>
<p>
Another major factor for developing countries is
undeclared wars and wars fuelled by an unjust economic
and political order capable of destabilizing and ruining a
country. A clear instance of this kind of conflict is the
United States blockade of Cuba, which has already lasted
close to 40 years. Suffice it to recall the many billions of
dollars this has cost the Cuban economy.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, we have only two options if we are to come to
grips with these issues in the third millennium: either we
continue with the animal ethics that would lead us
inexorably to collective suicide, or we adopt human ethics
as the only means of saving our civilization.
</p>
<p>
This is why President Fidel Castro, in his recent
honorary address at the Universidad Autónoma de Santo
Domingo, affirmed:
</p>
<blockquote>
"The world cannot save itself if it continues on its
present course. In my opinion there will not be the
slightest chance of survival for the species, nor will
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
there be any chance of survival for the globalization
and the new order that are being established,
because masses rise up, because peoples rise up,
because humankind rises up."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
He closed by announcing the important meeting on
globalization and neoliberalism that prominent economists
from Latin America and other parts of the world will hold
next January in Havana. At that meeting, exactly as our
President stated, the conclusion will be reached that the
question is not how to fight the inexorable phenomenon
of globalization, but how to fight, cooperate, reflect and
act in order to achieve a human and fair globalization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>The President </b><i>(interpretation from Spanish)</i>: I now
call on the representative of the Netherlands.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Mr. Ramaker </b>(Netherlands): Next week the
Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Jozias van
Aartsen, will have the opportunity to congratulate you,
Sir, on behalf of the Government of the Netherlands, on
your assumption of your high office.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Today I wish to share with you some thoughts of the
newly appointed Netherlands Minister for Development
Cooperation, Ms. Eveline Herfkens. Ms. Eveline Herfkens
had been looking forward to this meeting, and she is
terribly disappointed that she was unable to join us today.
As we speak, the Government is debating in Parliament
its policies for the coming year, and her presence in The
Hague is indispensable. Ms. Herfkens, however, will be
with us during the forthcoming general debate in the
Second Committee.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Nevertheless, she wanted to contribute to the debate
today in a personal way, and has included her views on
the matter in the following statement. With the Chair's
permission, I would like to read her statement into the
records of this meeting:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"I would like to share two comments with the
Assembly. First, I want to make a strong pitch for
multilateralism. To many nations, over many
decades, multilateralism has been an article of faith,
an independent policy goal all by itself. Today,
multilateral cooperation has come under pressure.
Instead of a policy goal in its own right, it has
become one of many policy instruments, an
instrument to be used when conducive to the
national interest. Countries prefer cooperation to be
ad hoc, and to the extent that it suits their needs.
International organizations are rated by the benefits
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
they have to offer, or the services they can provide. I
refer to that attitude as a shopping mall mentality'
with regard to multilateral cooperation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"That kind of cynicism does not sit very well
with the people I represent. By virtue of its
geographical
situation,
the
Netherlands
has
traditionally been a seafaring nation, a nation of
traders. Besides becoming the eighth largest trading
nation in the world, we have become an outward-
looking people, internationally oriented. We feel a
strong
commitment
to
multilateralism.
We
are
probably one of the few countries whose Constitution
has
given
a
special
position
to
international
organizations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Yet to us, this is not a matter of mere principle.
We
are
pragmatic
as
well.
We
also
favour
multilateralism
for
reasons
of
necessity.
In
a
globalizing world, people are faced with problems that
cannot be tackled single-handedly, even by the most
powerful of nations. We in the Netherlands seek to
promote the institutions of worldwide cooperation,
with the United Nations system at its core. The United
Nations and its specialized agencies, as well as the
Bretton Woods Institutions and more recently the
World Trade Organization, have proved to be a viable
framework for facilitating cooperation. Together they
span the entire range of human activity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"But these institutions are not good enough in
themselves. We must make them better -- we must
make them perform better. The United Nations must
constantly adapt to a world that itself is in constant
change. Agencies should no longer think in terms of
their own territory and be driven by donor envy. The
World Bank, the United Nations Development
Programme
and
the
Food
and
Agriculture
Organization, to name a few major players, should
pool their forces without reservation. I plead for
making use of the comparative advantages of each
organization for coherent policies. I also plead for a
systematic follow-up of United Nations summit
meetings. I plead, too, for better coordination at home,
among stakeholders in capitals. And I also plead for
more resources.

steady at 0.21 per cent of gross national product.
Only a handful of donor countries, including my
own, the Netherlands, do better than 0.7 per cent.
Despite pledges to the contrary, contributions to

a gradual decline in recent years.

"We the Member States, in particular the
affluent among us, must breathe new life into
multilateral cooperation. Funding should be made
secure and predictable. Donor burdens should be
shared by other nations as well -- by newly
industrialized States and by States with massive
revenues from oil. Capacity to give should be the
leading
principle.
For
our
part,
we
in
the
Netherlands will expand multilateral aid in the years
to come.

<blockquote>
"Yet multilateral development aid is not about
money alone. It is also about potential. For about
five years, developing countries, taken together, have
been spending more on interest and debt repayment
than they have received collectively in the form of
bilateral
aid.
Those
are
telling
figures.
All
international agencies combined, if they truly pulled
together, could probably have more of an impact on
the overall well-being of recipients than the national
aid programmes of individual donor countries
separately.

<blockquote>
"But that is not enough. In addition, there are
at least two major tasks as corollaries to multilateral
aid. First, those of us that can should ensure that all
developing countries, in particular the poor ones, can
take part in the process of global integration on
equal terms. In doing so, we should coax the United
Nations
agencies,
the
international
financial
institutions and the World Trade Organization to
bring this about.

"Secondly,
our
development
must
be
sustainable -- not sustainable just in terms of
ecology, as seems to be the fad, but sustainable in a
wider sense. It should be development that includes
basic human needs, that respects human rights, that

human capacities, that is socially responsible and that
does not mortgage the choices of future generations.
That, of course, is a lot to ask of multilateral
development cooperation. But then again, nobody said
it would be easy. If we are able to achieve it over the
long haul, multilateral cooperation may thus be able to
bridge the gap between the ever richer and the
eternally poor. And that, really, lies at the core of this
high-level dialogue."
