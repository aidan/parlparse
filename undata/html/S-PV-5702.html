<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>, of 23 December 2006, I have the honour to report to the Security Council, in accordance with subparagraph 18 (h) of that resolution, on the period 24 March to 21 June 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Shortly after I delivered my first 90-day report, on 24 March 2007 (see <a href="../html/S-PV-5646.html">S/PV.5646</a>), the Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1747 (2007)</a>, by which it imposed additional measures relating to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Those measures included a ban on the export of arms and related materiel from Iran, the designation of additional persons as subject to the assets freeze and to the travel measures, and the designation of additional entities as subject to the assets freeze. In addition, the Council called upon all States to exercise vigilance and restraint in the supply of the seven categories of conventional weapons as defined for the purposes of the United Nations Register on Conventional Arms and related services to Iran, and called upon all States and international financial institutions not to enter into new commitments for grants, financial assistance and concessional loans to the Government of Iran, except for humanitarian and developmental purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Meanwhile, the mandate of the Committee, as set out in paragraph 18 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>, has remained essentially unchanged. Since I last reported to the Council, the members of the Committee have met in eight sessions of informal consultations, bringing the total number of informal sessions to 14, mostly to continue the consideration of the guidelines for the conduct of the Committee's work. In addition, the Committee convened two formal meetings.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">I am pleased to inform the Council that, as a result of intense and fruitful discussions, the guidelines were adopted at the second formal meeting of the Committee, on 30 May 2007. The outcome, I feel, is a clear and well-balanced set of principles to guide the Committee's work, consistent with the letter and the spirit of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>, and also taking into account <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1747 (2007)</a>. It represents a consensus and addresses, to the greatest extent possible, all the concerns that were raised. I should also highlight that the guidelines incorporate the delisting procedure as set out by the Security Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1730(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1730 (2006)</a>, of 19 December 2006. The text of the guidelines has been transmitted to all Member States for their information and use, as necessary, and is also available on the Committee's web page.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">In paragraph 8 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1747 (2007)</a>, the Council called upon all States to report to the Committee within 60 days of the adoption of that resolution on the steps they had taken with a view to implementing effectively paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of that resolution. Accordingly, in my capacity as Chairman, I transmitted a note verbale dated 20 April 2007 to all Member States, drawing their attention to paragraph 8 of the resolution. The note verbale also served as a reminder to those States that had not yet reported under paragraph 19 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a> of their obligation to do so. Those States were given the option to submit a combined report under both resolutions if they so wished.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">As of today, the Committee has received reports from 50 Member States, as well as a report from the European Union, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1747 (2007)</a>. Of those, 15 reports were received by the deadline, that is, on or before 23 May 2007, and seven are combined reports under both <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1737 (2006)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">1747 (2007)</a>. The Committee has also received seven additional reports pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>. That brings the total number of reports received under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a> to 73. As before, I would like to inform the Council that, out of the 50 reports received within the past three months under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1747 (2007)</a>, 38 States reported that they already had legislation in place that covered the relevant paragraphs of the resolution. A further 12 States reported on the steps they had taken, or will be taking, to put the necessary legal framework into place. Finally, all States that submitted reports assured the Committee of their commitment to implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1747 (2007)</a> and/or <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">1737 (2006)</a> and to meeting their obligations as outlined therein.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">Although during the reporting period the main focus of the members of the Committee was on the Committee's guidelines, the Committee also dealt in parallel with a number of notifications and requests for exemptions with respect to the measures imposed by the Council. Pursuant to paragraph 15 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>, which does not require a Committee decision, the Committee has received 10 notifications of the unfreezing of assets or receipt of payment in connection with contracts entered into prior to the listing of certain entities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">The Committee has also granted, pursuant to subparagraphs 13 (a) and 13 (b), respectively, of the same resolution, six exemptions to the assets freeze to cover basic expenses and three exemptions to the assets freeze to cover extraordinary expenses, as determined by the relevant States, of listed entities. Lastly, the Committee has received, pursuant to paragraph 10 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a> and paragraph 2 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1747 (2007)</a>, a notification concerning the travel of a listed individual.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">As part of its role of monitoring the implementation of the measures imposed by the Security Council, the Committee has considered, and responded to, two written requests for clarification, received from Member States, concerning certain aspects of the sanctions regime imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1737 (2006)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">1747 (2007)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This concludes my summary of the Committee's activities. In addition to dealing with requests for exemption set out in paragraphs 9, 13 and 15 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>, on which I have reported, the Committee has a mandate to designate additional persons and entities as subject to the assets freeze and, in the case of the former, also to the measures concerning travel. The Committee also has a mandate, under paragraph 3 (d) of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>, to determine any additional items, et cetera, which could contribute to Iran's enrichment-related, reprocessing or heavy-water-related activities, or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. During the reporting period, the Committee did not receive any requests for designation of individuals or entities on the basis of the criteria contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>. Nor did the Committee receive any requests to include any additional items in the lists of proscribed items.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The 1737 Committee will continue to discharge its mandate as effectively and as efficiently as possible.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Wolcott Sanders</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">Mr. President, our delegation wishes to express its appreciation for your continued leadership as the Chairman of the Security Council's 1737 Sanctions Committee and for your report to the Council today. Your efforts were essential in the Committee's establishment of its guidelines on 30 May 2007, and they continue to be critical as the Committee now shifts to a discussion of substantive matters.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">Ninety days have passed and, unfortunately, we cannot report that Iran has complied with either <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>, adopted on 23 December 2006, or <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1747 (2007)</a>, adopted on 24 March 2007. To the contrary, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General ElBaradei's report to the Council and to the IAEA Board of Governors on 23 May confirms that Iran has failed to suspend its uranium-enrichment- and heavy-water-related activities and to cooperate fully with the IAEA in its ongoing investigation. Instead, Iran has taken steps to limit the IAEA's access to the Arak heavy water research reactor and has announced a suspension of implementation of the early declaration provisions of its IAEA Safeguards Agreement; the legitimacy of these steps has been refuted by the IAEA, but Iran's decisions in this regard are deeply troubling.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">We continue to urge all Member States to stress to Iran the importance of its compliance with its obligations in their regular discussions and consultations with Iran and the benefits that will accrue to Iran in return for compliance. In that regard, I would like to reiterate that the generous package offered to Iran in June 2006 by the Permanent Five (P-5) plus one remains on the table. We believe that this package and the historic offer extended by the United States to engage in direct talks with Iran, alongside our P-5 plus one partners, should Iran suspend enrichment, represent the best path towards a diplomatic solution of this matter. It is our hope that the Iranian regime will change its current confrontational course, suspend its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and engage in constructive negotiations on the future of its nuclear programme.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa04">We are pleased to note that so many States have taken their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 1737 (2006)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">1747 (2007)</a> seriously, and have submitted timely and substantive reports on their implementation of the measures contained therein. Our delegation found many of these reports informative in their scope and discussion.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa05">On the other hand, we found some reports to be less than detailed in their treatment of the steps taken by Member States to enforce or enact laws or regulations to implement the resolution. Comprehensive descriptions of those steps are necessary in order for members of the Committee to have a complete picture of Member State implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1737 (2006)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">1747 (2007)</a>. We encourage States to provide the greatest detail possible when responding to these reporting requests and, more generally, to any such requests set forth in Security Council resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa06">We are pleased to note that many States have responded to the Security Council's call for implementation reports for <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1747(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1747 (2007)</a> but are concerned that only 40 per cent of Member States have submitted reports as required by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a>. We urge those States that have not yet done so to fulfil this requirement and to ensure the implementation of those resolutions without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa07">Finally, we also take note of numerous notifications invoking exemptions to the asset freeze requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1737 (2006)</a> under paragraphs 13 and 15 of that resolution and stress that Member States should be judicious in the application of those exemptions. We also encourage Member States, firms and financial institutions to close out quickly any existing legitimate contracts with designated individuals and entities.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa08">Our delegation looks forward to continuing to work with others in the Committee to execute our mandate under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1737(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1737 (2006)</a> and to ensure the most robust and comprehensive implementation possible of these critical resolutions in order to achieve their ultimate objectives.</p>
