<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Poernomo</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk10-pa01">My delegation is particularly enthusiastic about speaking now because we know that, with the agreement reached at this session of the General Assembly to renew the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership, a further step has been taken towards the implementation of the resolution on this subject. The resolution, which calls, <i>inter alia</i>, for the holding of a high-level dialogue for a period of two days at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the theme of the social and economic impact of globalization and interdependence and their policy implications, constitutes an important landmark that we have been advocating over the past two years.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk10-pa02">The adoption of this resolution demonstrates the international community's determination to recognize that in promoting development in these vastly changed times, with rapidly growing interdependence, there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits, shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence. We believe that the much-lauded spirit of partnership, which has been manifested in numerous intergovernmental forums over the past two years, will be further strengthened and more broadly embraced when such a dialogue is held in the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk10-pa03">We consider that this first dialogue is a critical and necessary step towards ensuring that the process of fulfilling the commitments to cooperation for development will steadily move forward. In this respect, we believe it is indispensable that the preparations for the dialogue be undertaken well in advance by the Secretariat. I should add that since this is the first of a series of dialogues it is extremely important that we succeed. We should therefore spare no effort to ensure a successful outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk10-pa04">I would like to stress one further point: the linkages between the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on the Agenda for Development, on the one hand, and the dialogue, on the other, as stated in the resolution. Obviously, the dialogue and the Agenda should be mutually supportive. Indeed, the renewal of such a dialogue could well serve as a critical instrument for implementing the Agenda for Development; and the Agenda should greatly help by providing a supportive framework for conducting the dialogue within the United Nations. As such, the dialogue would also help to bolster the central role of the General Assembly in advancing international economic cooperation for development.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk10-pa05">Having said that, I would only like to add that my delegation looks forward to the first high-level dialogue, which is to take place at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly. Thus, we would like to express our readiness to actively participate in the dialogue, to which we attach great importance, especially in the pursuit of our common objective of improving the well-being of all mankind.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk14">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Biørn Lian</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa01">In my capacity as Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa (UNETPSA), I am pleased to introduce the report of the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/A-50-750.pdf" class="pdf">document A/50/750</a> and the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.65.pdf" class="pdf">document A/50/L.65</a>. I have been informed that since the draft resolution was printed, some additional countries have indicated that they will co-sponsor it. These countries are: Guyana, the United Republic of Tanzania and the United States of America. This wide range of co-sponsoring countries from different regional groups reflects the broad support of the international community for the important work of this Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa02">I would like to point out at the outset that this will be the final report submitted to the General Assembly. As soon as its recommendations are endorsed and the attendant resolution adopted by the General Assembly, UNETPSA will cease to be considered as a General Assembly item. Allow me therefore to provide a brief historical overview of the Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa03">By resolution 2349 (XXII) of December 1967, UNETPSA was established by integrating earlier special programmes aimed at assisting persons from Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe and from Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique while the countries were under Portuguese administration. The following year, by resolution 2431 (XXIII), the Trust Fund for UNETPSA and the Advisory Committee were established. Norway has consistently been one of the major donors to the Trust Fund and in 1980 succeeded Canada as Chair of the Advisory Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa04">Over the last 27 years since its inception, UNETPSA has trained close to 10,000 individuals from southern Africa. The Programme can be proud of having trained individuals who later assumed leadership roles such as a prime minister and a foreign minister and other cabinet ministers in some of these countries upon independence. In the case of South Africa, several national ministerial cabinet posts and provincial premierships are being held by individuals who have benefited from the Programme. Some of these UNETPSA graduates were trained in the front-line States and others received their training abroad. Other graduates are senior administrators of universities and <i>technikons</i>. Still others could be found managing the local and regional peace committees and structures which were established under the National Peace Accord. In this capacity, they provided essential cooperation during the United Nations preventive diplomacy and peace-building period preceding the April 1994 elections.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa05">When the Programme was established, it called for training in the sectors which had previously been neglected for the disadvantaged majority. These sectors include agriculture, law, engineering, agronomy, public administration, education, business and industrial management. UNETPSA has indeed remained true to these sectors as priority fields of study. The Programme has also recently stressed a multi-pronged approach to capacity- and institution-building of the historically disadvantaged institutions and non-governmental organizations by training individuals at these institutions and by upgrading academic staff, particularly in mathematics and sciences, as well as the administrative staff of the universities and <i>technikons</i> concerned. Particular attention is given to the role of women in development.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa06">I wish now to refer to the report before the Assembly. It will be noted that chapters I through IV introduce the Programme and its activities during the period 1 September 1994 through 31 August 1995. Chapter V contains the conclusions and recommendations regarding the future of the Programme. These recommendations were called for by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-17.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/17</a>, operative paragraph 8, which invited the Secretary-General to make recommendations to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session on the future role of the Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa07">The recommendations are encapsulated in operative paragraphs 2 through 8 of the draft resolution now before us. For the purpose of integrating the goals of the programme with the overall multilateral development programnmes of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the draft resolution calls for the transfer of the management of UNETPSA and its funds as well as the decision-making authority to UNDP as soon as possible, but no later than 1 May 1996. The draft resolution also calls for the extension under UNDP of the present mandate for a period of three to five years, while retaining the Programme as an identifiable entity. The Programme should continue with its focus on human-resource development, with the objective of capacity- and institution-building among the historically disadvantaged sectors of the population.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa08">Allow me to express, on behalf of the Advisory Committee, our appreciation to those Member States, organizations and institutions which have contributed to the success of the Programme. I would also like to express, again on behalf of the Advisory Committee, our gratitude for the persistent efforts of, and the valuable assistance given to the Programme by, the Secretary-General and the UNETPSA staff. Particular appreciation should be expressed to the Officer-in-Charge, Ms. Angela Masithela. I am confident that those staff in the Department of Development Support and Management Services (DDSMS) whose posts will be abolished as a result of this administrative streamlining will be given priority in the ensuing redeployment.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa09">Finally, the Advisory Committee is pleased that, as a result of the transfer of UNETPSA to UNDP, its mandate will be completed and the Committee will be discontinued.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk14-pa10">As South Africa strives to overcome the legacy of decades of apartheid, I would like to underscore the importance of the continued provision of assistance by the international community. The magnitude and urgency of the training and educational needs facing the country are enormous. Many challenges must still be faced before our vision of the new South Africa can become a reality. Prominent among these challenges is the need to provide sustained opportunities to enable the disadvantaged young South Africans to gain equal access to the education and skills necessary to improve their lives and to enable them to take a full part in the development of their new democratic and non-racial society. The continued commitment of the international community is vital to help meet this challenge.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zulueta</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">The European Union has noted with satisfaction the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/A-50-750.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/750</a>) of 7 December 1995 on the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa. That report underlines the important contribution the Programme has made in recent years towards fostering the educational needs of disadvantaged students from South Africa, and towards overcoming the legacy of apartheid. Furthermore, the report defines the proper framework in which the goals of the Programme can be integrated into the overall context of multilateral development programmes, with a view, in particular, to meeting the urgent need to contribute effectively to the immense human-resources requirements of the new, non-racial and democratic South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">States members of the European Union have contributed substantially over the years to the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa. The European Union considers that the need to improve the educational system is a long-term development priority and would therefore best be addressed through the continued assistance of the international community and United Nations agencies now operating in the new South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">The European Union welcomes <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.65.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.65</a>, on the Programme, which we hope will be adopted by consensus today, and we commend the decision taken by the Advisory Committee on the future of the Programme, which the European Union believes is a step in the right direction.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">The European Union attaches particular importance to the decision to transfer, no later than 1 May 1996, the management of the Programme and its funds and of the decision-making authority to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through the Executive Board of UNDP. We also note the decision to endorse the activities of the Programme and to request UNDP to continue to place the primary focus of the Programme on human resource development aimed at capacity- and institution-building by contributing to South Africa's human resources.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">We wish to pay tribute on this occasion to the staff of the Programme and to the Advisory Committee, in particular to its Chairman, for their outstanding work over the years.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">It is the sincere wish of the European Union that the valuable contribution that the Programme has made to improve the economic and social development of southern Africa through the educational sector will continue within UNDP.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mbatha</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the Government of South Africa, I wish to thank all donor countries that have over the years rendered valuable assistance to the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa. We also wish to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General, the Advisory Board of the Programme and all organizations, agencies and individuals that have cooperated with and made contributions to the success of the Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">Indeed, the Programme has made considerable progress; hundreds of students in southern Africa have benefitted from the Programme. With the birth of a new South Africa, the newly established Department of Education took the first step to deal at the national level with education and training: the Government made education free and compulsory for the first 10 years of schooling. The Reconstruction and Development Programme of the Government of National Unity provides for education and training components being built into many of its projects, such as public works and youth programmes. In the endeavour to restructure education and to eliminate the distortions and inadequacies in that area, the assistance that the United Nations Programme has provided was and still is indispensable.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">Therefore, we welcome the decision to extend the Trust Fund as an identifiable entity within and under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In this way those still being supported by the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa will be able to finish their studies by the year 1999. We support the call for the continuation of fund-raising and the mobilization of resources in order to further the aims and objectives of the Programme. In this connection we would hope that donors will be as generous in their support for the Programme as they have been in past years.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dlamini</span> <span class="nation">Swaziland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">The importance of the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa cannot be overemphasized. As previous speakers have clearly and ably outlined, it is of great significance for southern Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">Swaziland, a State that is a neighbour of the countries that were affected whenever efforts to liberalize southern Africa were undertaken, feels it should congratulate the founders of the Trust Fund and express our heartfelt gratitude to them. It is our hope that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), having displayed its abilities in a number of development fields, will pick up where the United Nations Educational and Training Programme has left off. It is our desire and our prayer that the countries that have benefitted will continue the uncompleted tasks before them. Drought has continued to militate against their efforts, and they still need to be assisted in upgrading their educational aims.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">It is our hope that, through the UNDP, stress will be placed on some areas not hitherto covered in the curricula, which are necessary to upgrade the development of the countries that have benefitted from the Educational Programme and that will continue to benefit under UNDP. We pray that greater efforts will be made to investigate thoroughly the question of whether all problems in the educational field have been addressed through the Fund.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dangue Rewaka</span> <span class="nation">Gabon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk08-pa01">It is a pleasure and honour for me to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.56-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.56/Rev.1</a>, entitled "Assistance for the reconstruction of Madagascar following the natural disasters of 1994", on behalf of the following sponsors: Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, Cuba, France, Gabon, India, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mongolia and South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk08-pa02">As members will recall, several cyclones, accompanied by tremendous floods, struck Madagascar in 1993 and particularly in 1994, leading to the destruction of most of the island and ruining several years of effort which that country had devoted to development. In view of the scope of the damage, which was far beyond Madagascar's means to repair, its Government had to seek aid from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk08-pa03">While recognizing the efforts made, it should be said that -- as emphasized by the Secretary-General in his report in <a href="../pdf/A-50-292.pdf" class="pdf">document A/50/292</a> -- the resources mobilized remain generally inadequate. Madagascar is still fragile and vulnerable to the impact of natural disasters.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk08-pa04">Because the situation has changed little, the draft resolution before us recalls resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council to provide emergency assistance to Madagascar to enable it to engage in the efforts necessary for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the areas affected by cyclones and floods.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk08-pa05">The operative part of the draft resolution urges all States and governmental and non-governmental organizations, together with United Nations organizations, programmes and specialized agencies, to increase their support to the Government of Madagascar. It also requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to mobilize the necessary resources to achieve these objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk08-pa06">The sponsors of <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.56-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.56/Rev.1</a> sincerely hope that the Assembly will adopt this text by consensus, as it did last year.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">The peace process in the Middle East, which was initiated at the Madrid Peace Conference in October 1991, has made new and historic progress with the agreements signed directly by the parties. Most recently, the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, signed on 28 September 1995 -- and this was witnessed by the European Union -- has already had tangible results. The European Union has constantly and unreservedly supported and participated in the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">If the peace process is to be successful, political negotiation must be accompanied by economic and social progress and a reduction in the disparities existing among the peoples of the region. On the bilateral as well as on the multilateral level, the European Union has provided support to the process, and we intend to continue to encourage the parties to take on greater responsibilities in their efforts to contribute to the economic development of the region as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">In the meantime, assistance to the Palestinian people continues to be an urgent need. It is essential for the Palestinian people to see each day in a concrete way the positive effects on their lives of the political changes taking place.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">As the main contributor of assistance to the Palestinian people the European Union reaffirms its commitment to continuing to provide economic and financial support and its willingness to study the most effective ways to meet the needs of the Palestinian people. We appeal to other States that have contributed in the past to increase their support, and to those that have not done so in the past to contribute to social and economic assistance to the Palestinian people.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">For this reason, the European Union is pleased to introduce and to co-sponsor <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.54.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.54</a>, entitled "Assistance to the Palestinian people". We shall be particularly pleased if, as a result of the new spirit of cooperation, the draft resolution is adopted by consensus.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Eliashiv</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">For many years now, Israel has been cooperating fully with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), as well as with other international organizations, in implementing programmes aimed at improving the living conditions of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In this respect, my delegation believes that the United Nations Special Coordinator in the West Bank and Gaza can play a significant role in achieving the social and economic goals set out by these organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">It is our view that the United Nations should increase its efforts and funding to assist the Palestinians in the territories, thus facilitating the successful implementation of the Declaration of Principles.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">Israel fully supports and encourages extending economic, financial and technical assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. We welcome the concerted efforts of Member States, international financial institutions, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to aid in the development of the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">We have made a genuine effort to reach a consensus on <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.54.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.54</a>, which addresses the important issue of assistance to the Palestinian people. We believe that economic and social progress can be advanced only through cooperation. Economic development and improved living conditions in the territories will encourage peace and stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">However, Israel's participation in the consensus on the draft resolution should not be construed as implying any position regarding the present status of the territories referred to as the "occupied territories". Additionally, our support does not carry any implication regarding Israel's position concerning the permanent status of those territories, which, in accordance with the Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September 1993, is a matter to be negotiated between Israel and the PLO.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">With regard to operative paragraph 9, we hope that the proposed United Nations-sponsored seminar will be organized by an appropriate United Nations body acceptable to all parties.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">The Declaration of Principles and the subsequent Agreements signed by Israel and the PLO, as well as the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty are momentous breakthroughs that open new vistas for economic and social progress, cooperation, prosperity and peace for our region.</p>
