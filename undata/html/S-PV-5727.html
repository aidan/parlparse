<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01"> I am honoured to address the Security Council after its adoption of this historic and unprecedented resolution. By authorizing the deployment of a hybrid operation for Darfur, the Council is sending a clear and powerful signal of its commitment to improve the lives of the people of the region and close this tragic chapter in the Sudan's history.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Today's resolution is the culmination of a serious and painstaking collaboration within the Security Council. I commend Council members for their efforts. The adoption is also the result of sincere and intensive cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union. As we open this new chapter, I pay tribute to the men and women of the African Union Mission in the Sudan, who have given their all in the service of peace -- some paying the ultimate price.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">We must now move forward, in all haste, to build on their work. We must put in place the complex and vital peacekeeping operation which the Council authorized today. The Council is familiar with the administrative, logistical and serious operational challenges that must be overcome to establish the hybrid mission. We must dedicate ourselves fully to deploying a mission that will make a clear and positive difference in the lives of the people of Darfur. They have a right to expect nothing less.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Preparations for the operation have been under way since early this year. Today's resolution will give even greater momentum to our efforts. If we are to meet the ambitious goal established by the resolution and assume authority in Darfur by the end of the year, the Council must remain engaged. Member States, especially troop- and police-contributing countries, must provide every support. Additional capable troops must be committed. Support systems must be put in place. Command structures must be established. National Governments know from their own experience that this takes time. But time is not on our side.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Equally fundamental will be the unequivocal and continuous support of the Government of the Sudan. If the Government is not a good-faith partner in this initiative, the operation will fail. We have the same expectation of the rebel movements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">As we recognize the importance of today's resolution and redouble our collective efforts to strengthen peacekeeping in Darfur, we must also acknowledge that it is only through a political process that can we achieve a sustainable solution to the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The Special Envoys of the United Nations and the African Union have stepped up their efforts and will be meeting with the parties in Arusha later this week. It is crucial that the Arusha meeting yield positive results, so as to pave the way for negotiations and, ultimately, a peace agreement. Only in this way can we end the violence and destruction that have afflicted Darfur for more than three years.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">We will build peace through negotiations for a political settlement and sustain peace on the ground with our peacekeepers. I look forward to working closely with the members of the Council, with the African Union and with all Governments concerned as we advance towards our shared goal.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the Secretary-General for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">I shall now give the floor to those members who wish to make statements following the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">The United Kingdom welcomes the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a> authorizing the deployment of the African Union/United Nations hybrid mission in Darfur. We welcome also the presence of the Secretary-General with us today and we pay tribute to the work that he has done with Chairman Konaré of the African Union to bring us agreement with the Government of the Sudan on this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">It is right today to pay tribute to the work done and the sacrifices made by the troops and other personnel who have served in the African Union Mission in Darfur (AMIS) over the past three years. They have been peacekeepers without a peace to keep.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">The replacement of AMIS by the African Union/United Nations hybrid operation is an important step forward, but for peace to take root and to endure in Darfur, the hybrid operation needs to be part of a more comprehensive approach. My Prime Minister and President Sarkozy of France set this out in Paris 10 days ago. Prime Minister Brown focused on Darfur over the weekend, yesterday with President Bush and today with the Secretary-General. There is no higher foreign policy priority for my Government.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">The challenge ahead is multifaceted. It requires a matching response, embracing urgent action on the political, security and humanitarian tracks. The focus now must be on securing a political settlement in Darfur that engages all the parties to the conflict. We applaud the efforts of the African Union and the United Nations envoys, and we pledge them our full support for the meeting in Arusha in the coming days and for the crucial period ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">We must intensify efforts to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance to relieve the suffering of the 4 million people who depend on aid in Darfur. We must ensure that a large, robust, effective and coherent African Union/United Nations force deploys to Darfur in the coming month to protect civilians, to prevent armed attacks from any quarter and to give hope and security to the people of Darfur. That is what we have authorized today. It is an unprecedented undertaking in scale, complexity and importance.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">The Council calls on all the parties to the conflict, on the Sudan's neighbours and on the wider international community to support this effort. We call for cooperation, and we welcome the evidence of cooperation that we have seen thus far, including particularly from the Government of the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">The sponsors made great efforts to consult the Government of the Sudan during the negotiation of this resolution. Its unanimous adoption is a strong signal from the Council that we expect and we want cooperation from all sides in the Sudan and that cooperation should develop and grow. The path set out in this resolution is one of cooperation with the Sudan -- with its Government and all the parties in the Sudan -- with the African Union and across the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">But we call also for compliance. The resolution requires the Secretary-General to report to the Council on the parties' performance in complying with all the requirements of this comprehensive resolution. If compliance fails, consequences will follow. As my Prime Minister and the French President made clear, we will judge all the parties on actions, not on words. Today's decision needs follow-up in all areas of the international effort: political, economic, security and humanitarian.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">The catastrophe of Darfur will not be ended by the raising of 15 hands in this Chamber. The suffering will not be ended by our vote. But today's decision and the actions that flow from it offer the prospect of a new start for Darfur. That is our hope; that is our goal.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lacroix</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">France welcomes the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a>. The establishment of the African Union/United Nations hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID) is a decisive step in the international community's action to put an end to the suffering of the people of Darfur and to restore lasting stability in that region of the Sudan. It generates great hope for Darfur; it is now up to us to translate that hope into reality.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The decision was the outcome of a process of cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union that was exemplary in many respects. That cooperation led to the high-level Addis Ababa Agreement of 16 November. In that respect, my delegation welcomes the personal commitment of the Secretary-General, whom I welcome to this meeting, and the decisive action of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission in this endeavour. The decision was also the fruit of a collective effort of the international community, among which the principal actors on Darfur mobilized to provide a strong and decisive response to the political, security and humanitarian challenges posed by the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">France took full part in that effort by bringing together in Paris on 25 June the participants of the expanded Contact Group for Darfur; by preparing, jointly with the United Kingdom, the text of today's resolution; and by working actively, in close cooperation with all our partners in the Security Council, to ensure the timely adoption of the text, as the President of France and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom vowed to do on 20 July.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">Throughout the process, my delegation and that of the United Kingdom were also inspired by the concern to involve the Sudan, whose Government has a critical responsibility for the implementation of the resolution. We intend to continue to work with the Khartoum authorities to ensure the speediest possible deployment of the African Union/United Nations hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and to create the conditions necessary for it to be effective. We appeal to the Sudanese Government and to all parties to the conflict to cooperate fully to attain those goals. To that end, everyone must fully respect the ceasefire.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">We are all aware that we face the particularly heavy challenge of completing the deployment of UNAMID so that it can make a real difference on the ground. Given its exceptional size, its unprecedented hybrid nature and joint leadership by two organizations, and the difficulty of the terrain and the situation there, UNAMID will require special commitment and ongoing mobilization on the part of the international community, relying on the United Nations and the African Union, which have a special responsibility. France will stand with them.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">During the forthcoming transition in the field, we will also have a special responsibility to continue to support the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) before it hands over to the hybrid force. It is crucial in particular that the deployment of the heavy support package be concluded as soon as possible. We owe that to the soldiers of AMIS, to whom my delegation pays tribute. As the first mission to be deployed, AMIS has done an outstanding job in especially difficult conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">In addition to the establishment of UNAMID, we will have resolutely to pursue our collective work in various areas. First, we have the humanitarian task of helping the people of Darfur. In that regard, France pays tribute to the 13,000 humanitarian workers involved there. Their work must be fully supported and facilitated by the parties, in particular the Sudanese Government, pursuant to the communiqué issued jointly by that Government and the United Nations. The unacceptable attacks on the population absolutely must stop.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">Secondly, we must work for a political settlement in full support for the United Nations and African Union mediators, Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim. France welcomes the decisions taken in Tripoli on the peace negotiations. Negotiations must begin immediately between the Sudanese Government and the rebel movements, including those that have not joined the peace process. We call on them to join the process as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa09">Finally, we must act to mitigate the grave repercussions of the Darfur crisis in the region, particularly in eastern Chad and the north-east of the Central African Republic. Along with its European Union partners, France is ready to act to win support for the international police force in the field and to provide security for displaced persons and refugees in those two countries. We intend to pursue our aim of taking the speedy decisions whose urgency is dictated by the gravity of the situation of the populations involved.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa10">In the longer term, my delegation hopes that the rapid establishment of secure conditions and progress in the political dialogue will allow us to move towards long-term reconstruction through concrete projects that will improve the daily lives of the inhabitants. We must prepare for that as well.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa11">Our Council has today sent a very strong signal of its unanimous commitment to restoring peace and security to Darfur. The international community has come together to attain that goal. The coming months will be critical to responding to the high expectations elicited by today's decision and to ensuring that Darfur is no longer, as it is today, a synonym for despair, distress and violence. Let us live up to the challenge by remaining united and by contributing to and cooperating jointly in this long-term effort. France is more than ever resolved to do so.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Churkin</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">The Russian Federation believes the Security Council's adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a>, authorizing the establishment of a African Union/United Nations hybrid operation in Darfur that seeks to bring about a speedy and peaceful settlement of the situation there, to be important and timely. That decision embodies the positive cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union to achieve lasting peace and stability in Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">We are convinced that a settlement can be achieved exclusively through political means. The peace process must become genuinely comprehensive, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Sudan and with the constructive cooperation of the international community with the Sudanese leadership in the political and peacekeeping spheres. It is important that those fundamental tenets were reflected, with Russia's active support, in the text of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">We hope that the hybrid African Union/United Nations operation will have a real impact on moving the Darfur peace process forward. That, ultimately, is the main objective of the peacekeeping activities in Darfur, along with protecting the civilian population while observing the sovereign prerogatives of the Government of the Sudan. We hope that the planned talks with the Darfur groups will take place on schedule and that those groups will join the Darfur Peace Agreement, which will be effectively supported by the new mission. All Sudanese parties must fulfil their respective obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Work on the resolution's text was protracted and intense. We are pleased that the Security Council's members managed to reach agreement and to adopt by consensus the decision on this important question. We commend the emerging constructive interaction between the United Nations, the African Union and the Government of the Sudan. It is important to continue to deepen it and to strengthen mutual trust in the interests of a speedy deployment and successful action of the hybrid African Union/United Nations operation.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Nasser</span> <span class="nation">Qatar</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">On this, the last day of your presidency of the Security Council, Sir, my delegation wishes to express its sincere appreciation to you. Over the past month, we have been seized of matters of extreme importance for humankind and the maintenance of international peace and security. We hope that we have addressed those questions in accordance with the dictates of our conscience.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Since it first became a member of the Security Council, my delegation has taken and continues to take a keen interest in ensuring that our work is conducted in conformity with the United Nations Charter, international law and the positive perspective of political considerations in servicing humankind. That was our position with regard to the way the Council has addressed many issues, including that of the Sudan. The Sudan had taken the initiative to request the assistance of the United Nations in dealing with some of its internal affairs that need constructive and transparent support from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">I would like to welcome the presence of the Secretary-General with us today.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">No one can deny that the Sudan has taken numerous positive steps in its partnership with the United Nations and the African Union. These were clearly evident in the consent by the Sudanese Government to the deployment of the hybrid operation in Darfur, as well as its explicit request to the Council, during its visit to Khartoum last June, to adopt a resolution authorizing that operation. In this regard, we stress the need to strengthen the current momentum in order to strengthen the tripartite partnership between the United Nations, the African Union and the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">What the Sudan needs now is a continuation of the approach of encouragement. It also needs that the promise made by the Council during its meeting with the Sudanese Government be honoured. I refer to the promise to continue to assist the country while respecting its sovereignty and its legitimate right to receive assistance from the international community and to compel the rebel movements to renounce violence and to join the peace process so that the achievements made can be maintained and preserved and, indeed, built upon.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1769 (2007)</a>, which we have just adopted, is aimed at the deployment of the hybrid operation in Darfur. The resolution states that it will have a predominantly African character, as much as possible. We would like to thank the sponsors of the resolution for having taken some of our concerns on board, after we had expressed some of our reservations. We would also like to commend the fact that a number of the concerns of the Sudan, particularly those raised in the last hours before the voting on the draft resolution took place, were also taken on board. We have seen understanding and responsiveness from the sponsors. We commend that responsiveness, which bridged the gap between the viewpoints and helped us to adopt the draft resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">We encourage our Sudanese brothers to continue their cooperation with the United Nations for the implementation of the resolution. We encourage them not to hesitate in requesting any assistance that might be needed to overcome any obstacles. This should be done in a spirit of collective action and be based on dealing with every question within its own perspective, and without confusing it with other questions, and with a professional approach. That is the best way to serve humanity and to strengthen the role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">On the basis of these considerations, we decided to vote for the resolution.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Slovakia is one the sponsors of this resolution and welcomes its unanimous adoption by the Security Council. We believe that reflects the firm commitment of the international community to resolve the Darfur crisis as a matter of priority. Slovakia has been following with great concern the tragedy in Darfur and the suffering of the civilian population, especially women and children. We believe that this unprecedented humanitarian crisis with grave regional consequences should come to an end as soon as possible. The adoption of this resolution is, in our view, a vital step forward in this direction.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">We are particularly pleased that this resolution also reflects the new partnership between the African Union and the United Nations, which we believe will be crucial for the future success of the hybrid operation. Finally, we call on all parties in the Sudan to facilitate an expeditious deployment of the hybrid forces and to fully cooperate with the international community for achieving a lasting and sustainable solution to the Darfur crisis.</p>

We are convinced that it marks a decisive moment in the activities of our Council in response to the crisis which has struck Darfur. By mandating the first hybrid peacekeeping force, this resolution is a strong moment of cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union. Given the importance of this moment, we welcome the fact that the resolution passed unanimously. Belgium would like to welcome the decisive role played by the African Union and its members sitting on the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">However, our responsibility does not stop here. By establishing the African Union/United Nations hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID), by giving it a robust mandate and an effective command structure, the Security Council has added a crucial instrument, both for protecting the civilian population at risk and for seeking a solution to the present crisis, which can happen only if all actors in a political process take responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">In that spirit, Belgium will continue in the coming weeks and months to support the efforts of the Secretary-General -- whose presence here I welcome -- for the rapid implementation of the support package for the African Union Mission in the Sudan, and for the deployment of UNAMID, as well as his political mediation efforts.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khalilzad</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">First, I would like to welcome the presence of the Secretary-General. I take this as another indication of his resolve to work for the resolution of the crisis in Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The United States is pleased that the Security Council has mandated a United Nations/African Union hybrid peacekeeping operation for the Darfur region of the Sudan. This force, known as UNAMID, will have a strong mandate to protect civilians and to support the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement. UNAMID is the largest operation ever deployed by the United Nations. This peacekeeping force of nearly 26,000 military personnel and police promises to play a critical role in ending the suffering of the people of Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The human toll in Darfur has been staggering. More than 200,000 people have died from conflict, and more than 2 million people have been forced from their homes and villages into camps both inside and outside the country. These displaced people are highly vulnerable to attack, malnutrition and disease, and they need our immediate help.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The brutal treatment of innocent civilians in Darfur is unacceptable to the United States. Since 2005, the American people have given more than $2 billion towards humanitarian relief and development.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The hybrid operation represents a new and unique form of cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union, and the adoption of this resolution is the culmination of intense efforts by many in the international community over the past several months. It must now be implemented without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">In its initial phase, the hybrid operation will draw most of its forces from the existing African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) and from the United Nations light and heavy support packages of assistance to AMIS. The transfer of authority from AMIS to the hybrid operation must occur as soon as possible. The transition is imperative, because it will combine the resources of the United Nations and of the African Union under a unified command and control. It will also allow additional hybrid forces to rapidly deploy and supplement the troops on the ground. The transfer could take place before the end of 2007, and we call on the United Nations and the African Union to expedite that transition.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">In adopting this resolution, the Council is entrusting UNAMID, its force commander and its personnel with carrying out its mandate using the full range of its authorities. UNAMID has the authority under Chapter VII to use force to prevent armed attacks, to protect civilians and to prevent any disruption of the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">It is imperative that the Government of the Sudan and other signatories comply fully with the Darfur Peace Agreement. The Agreement, among other things, prohibits attacks on civilians and protects them from being harassed, abducted, intimidated or injured. The Agreement also prohibits obstructing the delivery of humanitarian aid, restricting the free movement of people and goods, issuing hostile propaganda and inciting military action.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">The parties must also comply with the requirements of the present resolution, which in turn demands compliance with relevant agreements. We call on the Government of the Sudan and all other parties to the conflict in Darfur to cooperate fully with the implementation of this resolution and all other relevant resolutions, to cease attacks against civilians immediately, to permit full and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance and to engage fully in the political process led by the United Nations and the African Union to promote peace.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">The United States will continue its efforts to promote a broadly supported and inclusive political settlement, which is the only long-term solution to the crisis in Darfur. We call, in particular, on President Al-Bashir to provide maximum cooperation with the deployment of the new peacekeeping force. We hope that his acceptance of the force marks a new chapter in his cooperation with the international community. If the Sudan does not comply with the Darfur Agreement, and if the Sudan does not comply with this resolution, the United States will move for the swift adoption of unilateral and multilateral measures.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">On 29 May, President Bush made a promise to the people of Darfur. He said, &quot;The United States will not avert our eyes from a crisis that challenges the conscience of the world&quot;. Today, the Council has acted and taken a significant step towards ending that crisis by mandating the deployment of a peacekeeping force in Darfur. Now the Sudan faces a choice: the Sudan can choose the path of cooperation or defiance. Just as all eyes are on the Council to help protect the civilians of Darfur, so too are all eyes upon the Sudan, and we look to its Government to do the right thing and pursue the path of peace.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Spatafora</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Italy, as a sponsor of the present resolution, is particularly pleased with the strong message that has been sent through the unanimous adoption of this very important resolution. We express our strong appreciation to the Secretary-General for the crucial role that he has played over these months in bringing us to this point. He has shown strong determination and a very clear political vision.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">This resolution represents not the conclusion, but rather the beginning, of the international community's new commitment. The true challenge is now the implementation of the resolution. We therefore trust in the cooperation of all interested parties, in particular the Sudan Government.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Let us not underestimate the challenges lying ahead of us. This will be the largest current peacekeeping operation in Africa, and it will also be the most expensive for the United Nations. We must all be willing to do our part.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The peacekeeping force represents an essential component of the international action aimed at restoring peace in Darfur. However, a sustainable solution to the conflict, as has been stated, can only be political. To that end, we wish to reaffirm our utmost support for the efforts to re-energize the political process being conducted by the envoys of the United Nations and the African Union, Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim. In that context, our hope is that the upcoming meeting in Arusha will see the participation of all major rebel movements, leading to a shared platform for the subsequent negotiations with the Khartoum Government.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Let us always be well aware of the crucial relevance of the other two tracks of our comprehensive approach: the humanitarian and development tracks, which are central in helping to create the conditions for sustainable peace in the region.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kleib</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">Upon the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a>, we would like to express our appreciation for the constructive approach taken by all delegations in the Security Council, particularly the sponsors, in addressing our previous reservations and for the positive approach shown to the concerns of the delegation of the Sudan in the formulation of this unprecedented resolution, which, we believe, has laid the foundation necessary for a successful outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">This resolution is a direct result of the conclusions reached among the African Union, the United Nations and the Sudanese Government at the meeting held in Addis Ababa on 16 November last year. They agreed that the efforts to help the Sudan and Darfur would move along three broad fronts: re-energizing the political process, establishing a strengthened ceasefire and defining a way forward for peacekeeping. Therefore, while we have now adopted this resolution on the hybrid operation, the Security Council should continue to strongly support the political process under the stewardship of Special Envoys Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim. Moreover, efforts should now also be made to strengthen the ceasefire.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">To ensure the successful implementation of this hybrid operation, it is essential that the African Union Mission in the Sudan receive all possible support from the international community -- including financial support and accelerated deployment of the light and heavy support package -- in its implementation of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">Finally, the implementation of the resolution that we have just adopted should be based on a tripartite partnership among the United Nations, the African Union and the Sudanese Government. We strongly believe that it is only through such a partnership that the endeavours reflected in this resolution can succeed and ultimately help the people of Darfur.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Christian</span> <span class="nation">Ghana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa01">We, too, acknowledge the presence of the Secretary-General and thank him for his statement. We wish to thank all those who worked hard for the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a>, which paves the way for the implementation of the African Union/United Nations hybrid operation in Darfur. This is another step in the Council's efforts to deal effectively with the conflict in Darfur. Our ultimate goal should be to put an end to the suffering afflicting the victims of this conflict and to ensure that peace prevails in Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa02">With the adoption of this resolution, we are confident that the international community will honour its commitments towards the implementation of the hybrid operation. We also call on the Government of the Sudan and other parties to abide by the terms of the resolution, in the interest of peace and security in Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa03">The adoption of this resolution is the culmination of the tireless efforts of the African Union and the United Nations to cooperate in resolving the conflict in Darfur, and the momentum generated must not be lost in bringing peace to Darfur. It is also incumbent on the African Union and the United Nations to cooperate further in the resolution of other conflicts on the African continent.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa04">To conclude, Ghana remains committed to the promotion of peace and security on the African continent and will therefore continue to play its part toward the attainment of the objectives of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a>.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sangqu</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">We too welcome the presence of the Secretary-General at this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">South Africa welcomes the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a> deploying the first-ever African Union/United Nations hybrid peacekeeping operation. We commend the agreement of the Sudan for the hybrid operation to be deployed in Darfur, as detailed in the conclusions of the high-level African Union/United Nations consultations with the Government of the Sudan in Addis Ababa on 12 June 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">We also commend the efforts of the African Union and the Government of the Sudan for the successful deployment of the African Union Mission to the Sudan (AMIS), as well as the efforts of Member States and regional organizations that have assisted in its deployment.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1769 (2007)</a> gives practical expression to the partnership between the African Union and the United Nations, which, we hope, will go a long way in providing a strong basis for strengthened cooperation between the two organizations. We believe that the Darfur peace process provides the only sustainable chance for the resolution of this conflict, and we urge all parties to participate fully in the mediation meeting soon to be held in Arusha. The positive, forward-looking and constructive approach and the momentum gained through this resolution should be maintained as we embark on the challenging task of bringing peace to Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">We encourage the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission to continue to provide leadership and innovation to ensure that the hybrid force is deployed as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="nation">Panama</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I should like to welcome the presence of the Secretary-General, who is with us today. I recognize his leadership and his commitment to human rights in the Darfur region.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">The action taken today by the Security Council is undoubtedly reason for this collegial body to be proud -- as should the entire United Nations, of which the Council is a part. It is also a source of pride for the international community, which has been so concerned by this issue. But first and foremost, it should be a source of pride for the Government and the people of the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">But  we  must  be  clear  that  what  we  have  done today in this Chamber is only the beginning of a process, the true culmination or success of which will lie in the pacification of the Sudan and in respect for human rights in Darfur. That can be achieved only to the extent that we not only promote the protection and defence of human rights, but also help to ensure economic and social development of the Sudan and the entire region. Only then can we all feel truly proud.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa02">First of all, I would like to welcome the Secretary-General to our meeting and to thank him for his important statement. For the past several months, the Secretary-General has made unremitting efforts to resolve the Darfur issue. I would like to express my appreciation to him.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa03">The Security Council just unanimously adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a> to authorize the deployment of an African Union/United Nations hybrid operation in Darfur. The resolution is the product of a consensus reached through dialogue and consultation by the parties concerned and a long-awaited result for all parties.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa04">The Chinese side has always stood for political settlement of the Darfur issue and is committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Sudan and to the parties' engaging each other through dialogue and consultation on an equal footing.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa05">Both the African Union and the United Nations have a constructive role to play in this process. Meanwhile, the Darfur issue should be addressed in a comprehensive manner. Maintaining security and stability, promoting the political process, increasing humanitarian assistance and focusing on long-term economic and social development are related aspects, all of which should be treated on an equal footing. In our view, positive momentum on the Darfur issue has been generated in the past several months, providing a rare opportunity that the international community should not miss in order to push for a gradual, appropriate and comprehensive settlement of the issue.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa06">Today's resolution marks a major step forward in addressing the Darfur issue. That issue cannot be resolved without the efforts of the Sudanese Government, whose cooperation is now even more important for the deployment of the hybrid operation and for the fulfilment of its mandate. The Sudanese side has shown flexibility and has taken vigorous measures in resolving the issue, for which it should receive full recognition and encouragement from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa07">The consensus reached by the United Nations/African Union/Sudan tripartite dialogue mechanism on the hybrid operation is the political prerequisite on the basis of which this resolution is adopted. It is necessary to continue to attach importance and give full play to the positive role of this tripartite mechanism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa08">Moreover, today's resolution is the result of endeavours by Security Council members to seek common ground while setting differences aside and achieving mutual understanding and accommodation. The Security Council's speaking with one voice in authorizing the hybrid operation provides an important guarantee for the Darfur peacekeeping process.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa09">It should be particularly emphasized that the purpose of this resolution is to authorize the launch of the hybrid operation, rather than to exert pressure or impose sanctions. Throughout the consultations, China has consistently stated that the resolution should be simple and clear-cut, focusing on the core purpose of the Council authorizing deployment of the hybrid operation. Obviously, the text of the resolution still has room for further improvement, but the Chinese side believes that the final version, by and large, reflects that spirit. It is on this ground that the Chinese side joined the consensus and voted in favour of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa10">Today's resolution is only the first step towards full settlement of the Darfur issue. The next key step is to faithfully implement it. In deploying the hybrid operation, all parties should strictly abide by the tripartite consensus and avoid deliberate misinterpretation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa11">The current positive momentum is the result of hard work, so all parties concerned should attach high importance to mutual political trust. As the hybrid operation is launched, it is still essential to speed up the implementation of the three-phased plan. As the only international peacekeeping force in Darfur, the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) is shouldering daunting tasks and is faced with huge difficulties. In the near future, the Security Council should first focus on urging the international community to provide financial support to AMIS and fully implement the United Nations light and heavy support packages aimed at building the capacity of AMIS so as to lay a solid foundation for deployment of the hybrid operation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa12">Peacekeeping deployment is only one aspect of the settlement of the Darfur issue. The two-track strategy should continue to be implemented by accelerating the political process. The fundamental prerequisite for achieving lasting peace and stability in Darfur is to encourage all factions in the region to conclude and implement a comprehensive peace agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa13">China welcomes the success of the second Tripoli conference and appreciates and supports the great efforts made by the two Special Envoys of the African Union and the United Nations respectively. As a next step, the international community should take effective measures to persuade and press the non-signatories to participate in the political process. Furthermore, it is broadly agreed that a root cause of the Darfur crisis is poor development in the region. We need to attach high importance to rehabilitation, reconstruction and development in Darfur. The international community should take a long-term perspective, work out at an early date a development strategy for Darfur in consultation with the Government of the Sudan, and provide more input for economic and social development in Darfur, so as to fundamentally improve the lives of the people and uproot the source of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa14">The Darfur issue has attracted world attention. The African Union, the United Nations and other parties concerned are all helping to resolve this issue. China sincerely hopes to see an early, fair, equitable and proper settlement of the issue. We hope that the resolution adopted today will serve as a new starting point for enhanced cooperation between the international community and the Government of the Sudan and that it will greatly promote the political process of the comprehensive settlement of the Darfur issue. The Chinese side will continue to play a constructive and active part in the process.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa15">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa16">I give the floor to Mrs. Alice Mungwa of the Permanent Observer Mission of the African Union to the United Nations.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Mungwa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I should like to start by conveying the apologies of the Permanent Observer of the African Union to the United Nations, who is currently away from New York and could not attend this meeting in person. I have been instructed to deliver the following statement to the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The African Union would like to thank members of the Council and the Secretary-General for their statements this afternoon. The African Union welcomes the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a> on the hybrid African Union/United Nations operation in Darfur (UNAMID). This, members will recall, follows the adoption by the African Union Peace and Security Council, on 22 June 2007, of a decision authorizing the deployment as soon as possible of the African Union/United Nations hybrid operation, on the basis of the report of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission and the Secretary-General of the United Nations (see <a href="../pdf/S-2007-307-Rev.1.pdf" class="nolink">S/2007/307/Rev.1</a>), as explained and clarified during the technical consultations of 11 and 12 June 2007 with the Government of the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Members will recall that in that decision the Peace and Security Council of the African Union urgently requested the Security Council of the United Nations to urgently authorize the deployment of the African Union/United Nations hybrid operation. Today's resolution represents a landmark in our joint efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict in Darfur as well an effort to strengthen relations between the African Union and the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">Over the past three years, the African Union, in spite of the serious financial and logistical constraints facing the African Union Mission in the Sudan, has made sustained efforts to facilitate the resolution of the conflict in Darfur and the restoration of lasting peace and reconciliation in that war-torn region. As we move towards the African Union/United Nations hybrid operation, we would like to take this opportunity to restate the gratitude of the African Union to all our partners and to the United Nations Security Council for their valuable support.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">There is no need to stress the crucial importance of continued support for the African Union Mission in the Sudan until the transition to the African Union/United Nations joint operation is completed.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">While the adoption of this resolution marks a turning point, it goes without saying that many challenges lie ahead that require continued consultation and collaboration among all the stakeholders. The African Union is committed to continue working with the United Nations and the Government of the Sudan for the establishment of the mechanisms required for the effective establishment the hybrid operation in Darfur. It is our wish that the constructive spirit which prevailed during the entire period leading up to the adoption of this resolution will be continued and strengthened throughout all the coming stages in order to ensure the greatest possible success of UNAMID in the restoration of durable peace and security in Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">We wish also to take this opportunity to reiterate the appeal of the African Union Peace and Security Council to States Members of the United Nations for generous contributions to UNAMID. It is our conviction that the joint efforts of the United Nations and the African Union in Darfur and in other conflict and crisis situations in Africa will greatly contribute to building a new framework of cooperation between the United Nations, the African Union and other regional organizations, in the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as in the promotion of sustainable development.</p>
