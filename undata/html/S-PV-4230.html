<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council reaffirms its resolutions regarding the situation in Ethiopia and Eritrea, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1298(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1298 (2000)</a> of 17 May 2000, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1312(2000).pdf" class="pdf">1312 (2000)</a> of 31 July 2000 and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1320(2000).pdf" class="pdf">1320 (2000)</a> of 15 September 2000, which established the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council notes with appreciation the commitment of both parties towards a final and comprehensive peace settlement. The Council also notes with appreciation the rounds of proximity talks that have taken place and, pursuant to paragraph 14 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1320(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1320 (2000)</a>, calls on the parties to continue negotiations and to conclude without delay a final and comprehensive peace settlement. The Council emphasizes that the deployment of UNMEE should contribute to a positive climate for negotiations and that it does not replace the need for such a peace settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council reiterates its strong support for the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities between the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Government of the State of Eritrea signed in Algiers on 18 June 2000 (<a href="../pdf/S-2000-601.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/601</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council underlines the important role which confidence-building measures could play in dispelling the remaining distrust between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and encourages both States to agree on a package of such measures. In particular the Council encourages the parties to agree on the immediate release and voluntary and orderly return of interned civilians under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); the opening of land and air corridors for UNMEE; an exchange of maps showing mined areas; the prompt release of prisoners of war and their return under the auspices of the ICRC; and a moratorium on expulsions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council reaffirms the need for both parties to fulfil all their obligations under international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law. The Council calls on the parties to cooperate with UNMEE in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council expresses its continuing support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy, the Organization of African Unity, the President of Algeria and his Special Envoy, and concerned Member States to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council underlines the importance of the full compliance of Member States with the arms embargo imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1298(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1298 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council remains actively seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2000-34.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2000/34</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
