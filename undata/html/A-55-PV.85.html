	<div class="p">Before action is taken on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.56-Rev.1">A/55/L.56/Rev.1</a>, I should like to inform members that the draft resolution, inter alia, calls for an integrated, coordinated, comprehensive and balanced approach in the implementation of the Millennium Declaration. It calls upon all relevant organs, organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to be involved in the follow-up to the Summit. It invites specialized agencies and related organizations of the United Nations system to strengthen and adjust their activities, programmes and medium-term strategies as appropriate to take into account the follow-up to the Summit. And it requests the appropriate bodies to consider urgently how the implementation of the Declaration should relate to the biennium budget process and medium-term plan.</div>
	<div class="p">Should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.56-Rev.1">A/55/L.56/Rev.1</a>, the Secretary-General would ensure system-wide coordination to assist with the implementation of the Declaration and would identify, within the framework of the Administrative Committee on Coordination, innovative ways of enhancing cooperation and coherence throughout the United Nations system. In this context, he would request the appropriate bodies of the relevant United Nations system to consider how the implementation of the Declaration should relate to the biennium budget process and the medium-term plan.</div>
	<div class="p">The outcome of consultations with organizations within the United Nations system would be reported to the General Assembly in the context of the annual and the quinquennial reports called for in paragraphs 18 and 19 of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.56-Rev.1">A/55/L.56/Rev.1</a>, which would be prepared by the Office of the Secretary-General.</div>
	<div class="p">Should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.56-Rev.1">A/55/L.56/Rev.1</a>, no additional resource requirements are currently anticipated to arise in the biennium 2000-2001. Should any additional requirements be later identified, these would be reported to the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly in the context of its consideration of the agenda items related to the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 and for the biennium 2002-2003.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p"><i>  </i>On behalf of the European Union and all the sponsors, I have the honour to present the draft resolution entitled "Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.64">A/55/L.64</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">May I first of all inform the Assembly that the following countries have joined the list of sponsors: Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, Guyana, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Togo.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me, in response to the wishes of all the Members of the United Nations who have asked me to do so, to repeat our strong appreciation for the report that the Secretary-General has submitted to the Assembly together with the recommendations he deems necessary. Indeed, it is his responsibility to ensure the security of United Nations staff and associated personnel, and the provisions adopted in this respect at Headquarters and in the field can also benefit humanitarian personnel in general.</div>
	<div class="p">We wish to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General for the task he is undertaking, but this is also part of our responsibility as Member States. It is with this in mind that the European Union and the sponsors of the draft resolution have pursued this initiative.</div>
	<div class="p">We welcome the spirit of cooperation, understanding and consensus shown by all delegations throughout this work, which allowed us to reach a fully satisfactory result in keeping with our duties.</div>
	<div class="p">The aim was, first, to pay tribute to the personnel, whoever they may be, and to express our firm condemnation of any actions carried out against them in the exercise of their functions. Such actions are unacceptable, and it is the primary responsibility of the State concerned to prevent them, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and also to bring their authors to justice, especially by adopting the necessary legislation, as required by the text of the draft resolution submitted this year to the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me to take this opportunity also to remember all those who have lost their lives in humanitarian service or in the service of the United Nations, as sadly referred to in the report of the Secretary-General, and to hope that the draft resolution we are about to adopt will strengthen the security they need in order to be able to fulfil their missions.</div>
	<div class="p">Among the elements introduced this year, we should mention the appeal to all States to promote a climate of respect for all United Nations and humanitarian personnel. The text also emphasizes the need to ensure adequate training before deploying field personnel who are at risk, as well as to provide the Secretary-General with the necessary means for this purpose for personnel under his authority.</div>
	<div class="p">Moreover, the General Assembly wishes to confirm the need for a full-time Security Coordinator, as was already emphasized in a previous resolution, and the need to strengthen his Office and the current United Nations security system. We emphasize that these intentions should be put into effect quickly and translated into decisions to be adopted by the relevant organs in response to these requests, on the basis of the Secretary-General's recommendations.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, note is taken of the Secretary-General's report on expanding the scope of implementation of the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, and it is proposed that the General Assembly refer the comprehensive consideration of this matter to the Sixth Committee as a specific agenda item of the fifty-sixth session.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, allow me to make a positive correction to the draft resolution before us in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.64">A/55/L.64</a>. In the sixteenth preambular paragraph it is stated that the number of States parties to the 1994 Convention is 45; it is now 46, and that is the figure that should be recorded as the exact number at the time of adoption. We welcome this development, and we hope that this draft resolution, on a subject that should mobilize us all, will be able to be adopted by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p">In this context, the European Union has noted with optimism the commitment shown by Member States to continue to strengthen texts on this subject in the future, as the situation requires. The European Union reaffirms its gratitude, in particular to the sponsors, and its appreciation for the support and cooperation shown by all delegations that actively participated in the negotiations on this important question.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Thank you, Mr. President, for the honour of introducing draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.38-Rev.1">A/55/L.38/Rev.1</a>, entitled "International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters from relief to development", on behalf of its original sponsors, the Group of 77 and China, and Mexico.</div>
	<div class="p">Nigeria feels further honoured by the opportunity we were given to facilitate the informal formal consultations between the original sponsors and other partners -- including the European Union, the Japan, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand group (JUSCANZ) and the Russian Federation -- some of which have since indicated interest in joining the list of sponsors. The list, we are confident, will keep growing. Why will the list keep growing? The answer is not far-fetched: the negotiations were very frank, and flexibility was mutual, leading to consensus.</div>
	<div class="p">Natural disasters are neither people-friendly nor always country-specific. Thousands of lives and much property, as well as means of livelihood, are always lost in their wake, at a very high cost. That these events happen in developing countries, where development problems are enormous, is noteworthy. Also noteworthy is the fact that the primary responsibility for the initiation, organization, coordination and implementation of humanitarian assistance lies within each developing country's territory. These occurrences are also important because they reverse all gains made through the development efforts of developing countries. Therefore, the need for international cooperation cannot be overemphasized.</div>
	<div class="p">In the face of declining official development assistance flows and of the external debt burden, all huge problems of development that militate against the efforts of developing countries to initiate preparedness, even efforts to mitigate disasters, have to be very seriously considered in order to augment the efforts of developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p">We have discovered -- and this is the truth -- that natural disasters are one factor that joins humanity in common agreement. Natural disasters are a great cause of need, and humanity must be united when it comes to need.</div>
	<div class="p">It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries, relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in, access to and the use of technologies, to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how, in particular to developing countries, on concessional and preferential terms, as may be mutually agreed.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly has before it a draft resolution that enjoys consensus its 22 operative paragraphs, which have spelled out what needs to be done in the hope of having proper guidance from the guiding principles and from the Secretary-General's report, which we hope will guide our future endeavours in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me thank all those who took part in the negotiations for their willingness and flexibility, and particularly those who are going to join the list of sponsors.</div>

	<div class="p">I have the honour to introduce, on behalf of its sponsors, the draft resolution entitled "Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including special economic assistance: strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.54">A/55/L.54</a>. Since the publication of the draft resolution, the following countries have become sponsors: Bulgaria, Chile, Georgia and Guatemala.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution was discussed in informal consultations on 22 November. Valuable proposals were made for the improvement of the text, and agreement was reached on all paragraphs. My delegation is grateful for the contributions made by other delegations, and would like to thank the other sponsors and other delegations for the good spirit of cooperation and partnership in which the consultations were held.</div>
	<div class="p">By this draft resolution, the General Assembly would recall its previous resolutions on the topic, and those of the Economic and Social Council. It would take note of the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/A-55-82">A/55/82</a>); welcome the progress made by the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in strengthening the coordination of humanitarian assistance of the United Nations; and note the efforts made by the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the members of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee to implement recommendations set forth in previous agreed conclusions of the Economic and Social Council.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly would welcome the holding of the third humanitarian affairs segment of the Economic and Social Council last summer, and would invite the Council to further enhance the segment in future sessions. It would call upon relevant actors to cooperate to ensure the implementation of Economic and Social Council agreed conclusions of recent years.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, the General Assembly would request Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, through the 2001 substantive session of the Economic and Social Council, on progress made in strengthening the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me add that we have noted the submission by the Secretary-General of a note concerning the enhancement of the functioning and utilization of the Central Emergency Revolving Fund pursuant to previous requests by the General Assembly. We look forward to considering the note at the next session.</div>

	Mr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda)

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">As the President said, I am speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.35-Rev.1">A/55/L.35/Rev.1</a>, entitled "Emergency assistance to Belize". As listed in that document, the sponsors of the text are Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Finland, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, India, Ireland, Jamaica, Luxembourg, Mexico, Saint Lucia, Suriname, Sweden, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and my own country, Antigua and Barbuda. To that list I should like to add the following countries: Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Malta, Nicaragua, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Venezuela.</div>
	<div class="p">In speaking of this draft resolution, one is speaking, in effect, of the perilous conditions that exist in the Caribbean today -- and by the Caribbean I am not speaking only about the Caribbean islands but also about the coastal areas of the continent. Last year, for example, Venezuela suffered severe floods. And, of course, it is often overlooked that, in the Gulf, hurricanes usually batter various parts of Mexico. We are subject to a number of natural disasters which we can clearly see are connected to sea-level rise or to the greenhouse gases that are certainly affecting us. We see these effects in the rise of the level of the sea and the denuding of our coastal areas, which is actually affecting our countries' ability to maintain their standards of living and quality of life, because so many depend so heavily on tourism. Some countries are now finding that beaches of which they were once so proud are no longer desirable areas in which foreigners would choose to bathe.</div>
	<div class="p">We are in addition finding something that is amply brought out by what happened to Belize: whereas we could once speak about the countries that lay within a hurricane belt, that is no longer true. A hurricane went as far south as Suriname this year, and caught by surprise people who thought themselves safe from the perils faced by their Caribbean neighbours. Even though Belize has, technically, experienced hurricanes in the past, it was not expecting anything of this magnitude. Even today, areas of Belize are still under water because of what hurricane Keith did.</div>
	<div class="p">That is why it is so important that the United Nations should understand the problems, in terms of natural disasters, not only of Belize but of the entire Caribbean region. It is not hurricanes alone. From my island, Antigua, it is lovely to gaze to the south and see the volcanic eruptions on Montserrat. But in reality, they are causing so many problems for the beleaguered people of that lovely emerald island. In addition, we have, off Grenada, an undersea volcano known as Kick `em Jenny, which four or five years ago erupted some four times in one year.</div>
	<div class="p">Thus, we are plagued by all these natural disasters. But we have endeavoured to help ourselves. When these disasters occur, the Governments of the countries immediately make offers to the areas in question. This is one area where our military personnel are used very effectively. Our military personnel are used mainly for rehabilitation, since we do not have that many occasions on which they must engage in actual combat. Along with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency, to which we all contribute, there is a spirit of togetherness which causes us to act immediately when one of our brotherly or sisterly countries is affected. We were surprised this year that Suriname and Belize -- the latter being the subject of this particular draft resolution -- suffered so much. That is why we wanted the draft resolution to request the Secretary-General to give us a report. In the past, such reports have enabled us to draw lessons from them. When people visit some of our territories now, they wonder what it is about the people who live there -- what it is about their resilience -- that enables them to continue with their everyday ways, means and forms of living, and not be mentally or psychologically affected by these constant disasters. One Caribbean country that did not experience a hurricane between 1950 and 1989 has experienced six within the past five years.</div>
	<div class="p">That is the type of peril with which the inhabitants of the Caribbean countries live. That is why we are asking the General Assembly to demonstrate the togetherness and humanity of this glorious Organization and institution in adopting this draft resolution by consensus. It will send a clear message to all peoples, particularly, at this time, the people of Belize, that they have friends around the globe who not only empathize with them but are willing to come to their assistance through the parliament of parliaments.</div>
	<div class="p">I urge that this draft resolution be adopted by consensus.</div>

	<div class="p">Under agenda item 20 (b), I have the honour of introducing four draft resolutions relating to the following four countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Somalia and Liberia. I am speaking on behalf of all the sponsors mentioned in the draft resolutions, which we shall consider one after the other.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the draft resolution, entitled "Special assistance for the economic recovery and reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.36">A/55/L.36</a>. In addition to the countries mentioned in that document, the following countries have become sponsors: Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Namibia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, the United States of America and Zimbabwe.</div>
	<div class="p">The issue of special assistance for the economic recovery and reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been on the General Assembly's agenda since 1997 because of the political crisis in that country. The United Nations responded favourably by creating a trust fund, which was set up during the Meeting of Friends of the Congo in December 1997. Despite the efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to facilitate recovery, the people there continue to suffer, with admirable courage, the vicissitudes of a long political transition process that is having a devastating effect on economic structures, as well as the ravages of two successive armed conflicts that have hampered the speedy reconstruction of the country and of the social infrastructure, which has been hard hit by the years of crises. The Democratic Republic of the Congo therefore remains a poor and heavily indebted country.</div>
	<div class="p">We are greatly obliged to the Secretariat of the United Nations for ensuring that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has remained among its top priorities. Indeed, throughout this year, the United Nations Development Programme office in Kinshasa, acting as the coordinator of United Nations system-wide activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has been closely involved in the design, development, coordination and implementation of various development projects undertaken in the context of the fight against poverty.</div>
	<div class="p">The report of the Secretary-General, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-319">A/55/319</a>, describes very aptly the current situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We should like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the tireless efforts of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and regional leaders for their tireless efforts aimed at achieving peace and development for the courageous people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I fervently hope that the members of the General Assembly will adopt the draft resolution by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to Mozambique, the draft resolution, entitled " Assistance to Mozambique" , is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.53">A/55/L.53</a>. I am speaking on behalf of the sponsors of the draft resolution. In addition to those countries mentioned in the draft resolution, the following countries have become sponsors: Belgium, Chile, Cuba, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United Republic of Tanzania.</div>
	<div class="p">Since 1976, the General Assembly has regularly adopted a resolution on assistance to Mozambique as part of the international community's efforts to come to the assistance of that country and its people as they try to meet their reconstruction and development needs. These resolutions have provided a juridical and political framework for the bilateral and multilateral cooperation and assistance given to Mozambique, which has contributed to meeting the essential needs of the people and to the implementation of a development programme. With the considerable backing of the international community, in the 1990s Mozambique was on its way to achieving economic growth and sustainable development, as eloquently shown by the Secretary-General's report on assistance to Mozambique, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-317">A/55/317</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Nonetheless, at the beginning of this year, Mozambique was once again devastated by cyclones and floods that took a tragic toll in human life, property and infrastructure. This natural disaster, with its adverse impact on the economic, social and humanitarian situation in the country, was widely reported internationally.</div>
	<div class="p">The Mozambican Government is asking for assistance from the international community in general and the United Nations in particular so as to help it get a grip on this humanitarian disaster and its consequences. Recently, the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-96">resolution 54/96</a> L by consensus, which set up the appropriate framework for delivering international humanitarian assistance to Mozambique. We want to thank the international community for its support and solidarity during these trying times.</div>
	<div class="p">The considerable impact of the floods will be felt for several years to come in Mozambique. The natural disaster compromised the remarkable economic growth and sustainable development that Mozambique had experienced. Beyond that, this disaster is sapping the nation's long-term economic development programme, notwithstanding the praiseworthy efforts of the Government and the valiant people of that country.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution being submitted to the General Assembly today is designed to mobilize humanitarian assistance for the post-crisis reconstruction and recovery programme, as well as international support for long-term development and national reconstruction. We hope that, by adopting this draft resolution by consensus, the international community will renew its commitment to coming to the aid of Mozambique as it seeks to build on its achievements in the framework of its development programme.</div>
	<div class="p">Turning to Somalia, we have before us a draft resolution entitled "Assistance for humanitarian relief and the economic and social rehabilitation of Somalia", document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.55-Rev.1">A/55/L.55/Rev.1</a>, dated 7 December 2000. I am speaking on behalf of the sponsors listed in the draft resolution, to which Eritrea and Ireland should be added. I would say that this draft resolution is similar to other such resolutions adopted recently. However, this draft resolution contains some new paragraphs because of a new and highly positive development in the political situation in Somalia following the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, held in Arta, the Republic of Djibouti, from May to September 2000, under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and organized and facilitated by the Government of Djibouti. The Conference led to the adoption of a transitional three-year charter involving the establishment of a transitional national parliament and the formation of a transitional Government. Nonetheless, certain political groups within Somalia have remained outside the Arta process, thus constituting a challenge yet to be met. We very much appreciate the Secretary-General's report contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-415">A/55/415</a>. It should be updated to reflect these political developments in Somalia.</div>
	<div class="p">Here in the Assembly, we want to thank all the States, United Nations bodies and organizations, other international institutions and international, regional and non-governmental organizations that have helped Somalia. The disastrous consequences of the prolonged socio-economic and political crisis endured by Somalia cannot possibly be resolved in a short time. They will be felt for a number of years to come.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution I am introducing to the Assembly is designed to support the transitional Somali Government in its actions to achieve comprehensive national reconciliation in the context of the Arta process, because the restoration of peace will be the only way for the country to work calmly to achieve national reconstruction and development. This can happen after the establishment of appropriate civilian institutions within a democratic system. We hope that, by adopting this draft resolution, the international community, through the General Assembly, will reaffirm its determination to help Somalia achieve reconstruction and recovery.</div>
	<div class="p">On the subject of Liberia, draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.66">A/55/L.66</a> is entitled "Assistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Liberia". Again, I am speaking on behalf of the sponsors listed in that document. Through the decisive efforts for cooperation and peacemaking on the part of the Economic Community of West African States, the United Nations and the OAU, the people of Liberia have emerged from seven years of devastating civil war, and democratic elections were held in June 1997.</div>
	<div class="p">During the conflict and the post-war period, many countries that were friends of Liberia sponsored draft resolutions year after year to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Liberia. Obviously, Liberia continues to face daunting challenges in trying to rebuild its infrastructure and reactivate its economy. Despite the programmes initiated by the Government designed to achieve reconciliation and reconstruction, the pace of development has been less than satisfactory, and international assistance for the country's reconstruction programme has declined. We fully agree with the Secretary-General's statement in his report of 26 June 2000, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-90">A/55/90</a>, that it is absolutely essential for the international community at large and for the chief donors in particular to become more aware of the problems Liberia and the subregion are facing in the post-conflict period.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition to all this, the people of Liberia need subregional stability as a basis for sustained international support for Liberia's development efforts.</div>
	<div class="p">We, the sponsors of this draft resolution, express our gratitude to all the donor countries, the specialized agencies of the United Nations system, the European Union, the Bretton Woods institutions and non-governmental organizations for their participation in a joint mission held in Monrovia from 15 to 19 November 1999 to assess the National Reconstruction Programme and the use of donor funds committed at the 1998 Paris Donors' Conference for the reconstruction of Liberia. We ask those that have not yet honoured their pledges to do so.</div>
	<div class="p">We thank the Secretary-General for his continuing efforts to mobilize international assistance for the development and reconstruction of Liberia.</div>
	<div class="p">We call on all countries and intergovernmental organizations to provide assistance to facilitate the implementation of peace-building efforts in post-war Liberia.</div>
	<div class="p">Like past resolutions, the draft resolution before us is a consensus document. I ask that the General Assembly adopt it without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">That concludes my introduction of the four draft resolutions submitted to General Assembly for adoption without a vote.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">As it did last year, the Russian Federation has the honour once again this year to introduce to the General Assembly the draft resolution on humanitarian assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has undergone radical changes in the last year. At the same time, however, the humanitarian problems there are no less acute. As the report of the Secretary-General on this issue (<a href="../pdf/A-55-416">A/55/416</a>) rightly points out, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will face considerable humanitarian problems in the near future, and they may yet be magnified.</div>
	<div class="p">Yugoslavia continues to be a transit point for a very large number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, comprising over 700,000 persons whose socio-economic situation is deteriorating. Democratic changes are taking place against the backdrop of a catastrophic economic situation in the country and the deterioration of its social infrastructure. The situation with regard to energy, food supplies and finances is especially dire. In other words, the humanitarian situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia calls for continued -- and in most cases increased -- humanitarian assistance, in particular given the approach of winter.</div>
	<div class="p">It is for that reason that this draft resolution calls for the international community to render emergency humanitarian relief to the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, especially during the coming winter months. The United Nations -- which, along with its specialized agencies and, in particular, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has a special role to play in this regard -- is called upon to strengthen coordination in the granting of humanitarian assistance, especially by improving the consolidated inter-agency appeals mechanism. In that connection, the draft resolution calls on the Secretary-General to continue efforts to mobilize timely humanitarian assistance to Yugoslavia.</div>
	<div class="p">An important element of the draft resolution is the appeal it makes to the international community to support the Government of Yugoslavia in its efforts to ensure the transition from emergency humanitarian assistance to the long-term rehabilitation, reconstruction and development of the country. The role of the United Nations is also important in this regard. The Organization is requested to continue its efforts to evaluate the humanitarian needs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in order to establish effective links between emergency relief and longer-term assistance to Yugoslavia.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution gives great attention to seeking long-term solutions to the problems of refugees, especially through voluntary repatriation and reintegration. In this context, the draft resolution stresses the importance of developing regional cooperation to seek solutions in order to improve the difficult situation of refugees.</div>
	<div class="p">The Russian Federation is introducing this draft resolution on behalf of a large number of sponsors. Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.57">A/55/L.57</a> lists 31 States. In addition to the Russian Federation and Yugoslavia, countries of the European Union, of the Commonwealth of Independent States and of South-East Europe, as well as a host of other States that value the ideas contained in the draft resolution, are also sponsors. I wish to note with satisfaction that since the draft resolution was issued as an official document, Austria, Cuba, India, Japan and the United States of America have also become sponsors of the draft resolution. We wish to thank the sponsors for their support of our initiative, and to express our gratitude to other delegations for their cooperation and constructive contributions towards agreement on the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">We are confident that the General Assembly's adoption of this draft resolution will truly help accelerate the coordination of humanitarian assistance and the launching of broad international cooperation for the recovery and development of the economy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo and the entire Balkan region.</div>

	<div class="p">Before giving the floor to the representative of Ukraine to introduce draft resolutions <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.59">A/55/L.59</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.60">A/55/L.60</a>, I should like to make a few remarks on the closure on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on 15 December 2000.</div>
	<div class="p">The tragedy at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, almost 15 years ago, affected almost the entire territory of Europe -- but most of all Ukraine and the neighbouring areas of Belarus and the Russian Federation -- and caused long-lasting, complex problems. The human suffering caused by the accident cannot be measured, and its environmental impact was partly irreversible. The Chernobyl accident was a major global technological catastrophe, and an eye-opener in many respects.</div>
	<div class="p">We will soon take action on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.60">A/55/L.60</a>, on the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. We all welcome the decision by the Government of Ukraine to close the Chernobyl plant tomorrow, 15 December 2000. By doing so, Ukraine is acting pursuant to its commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding signed in Ottawa in 1995.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution before us invites the international community to continue to provide support to the Government and the people of Ukraine and other affected States. It is my sincere hope that the adoption of this draft resolution, in connection with the closure of the plant, will give new impetus to the concerted efforts by the United Nations system aimed at mitigating and minimizing the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.</div>
	<div class="p">I now give the floor to the representative of the Ukraine to introduce draft resolutions <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.59">A/55/L.59</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.60">A/55/L.60</a>.</div>

	Mr. Kuchynski (Ukraine)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I would like to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for your high assessment of the significance of the decision of Ukraine to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</div>
	<div class="p">I have the honour to introduce to the General Assembly the draft resolution entitled "Economic assistance to the Eastern European States affected by the developments in the Balkans", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.59">A/55/L.59</a>. I am pleased to announce that this draft resolution has been sponsored by the following delegations: Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United States of America and Yugoslavia.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to all the sponsors and to all delegations whose constructive participation in the informal consultations resulted in the consensus text of this draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">The purpose of the present draft, which is based on the text of the consensus resolution of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly and updated to reflect the new developments, is clear and apparent: to help the Eastern European States affected by the developments in the Balkan region to solve their special economic problems, especially in the sphere of regional trade and economic relations and particularly as related to the navigation on the Danube river.</div>
	<div class="p">To create favourable conditions for solving these problems, the draft resolution invites all States and relevant international organizations to assist the affected States in their efforts for economic recovery, development and economic cooperation in the region and beyond. It emphasizes the importance of a well-coordinated and timely donor response to the external funding requirements of the process of economic reconstruction, reform and development in the Balkans, as well as of financial support to other affected countries of Eastern Europe.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft welcomes the democratic changes in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and their positive effects on peace, stability and development in South-Eastern Europe.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me express my sincere hope that this draft will gain the broadest possible support and will be adopted by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p">I would also like to take this opportunity to introduce another draft resolution, which has a special meaning for my country. The draft resolution is entitled "Closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant" and is contained in the document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.60">A/55/L.60</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">We would like to thank all delegations for the cooperative approach they demonstrated in the course of consultations, which allowed for the development of a consensus draft resolution. We are particularly grateful to the sponsors of the draft. I have the pleasure to inform the General Assembly that since document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.60">A/55/L.60</a> was issued, the following countries have joined the list of sponsors of the draft: Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Monaco, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Uzbekistan.</div>
	<div class="p">Tomorrow the world will be witnessing an event whose historical significance has won wide international recognition. Its significance was reaffirmed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his statement yesterday and by the President of the General Assembly in today's statement.</div>
	<div class="p">On 15 December Ukraine will close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. By taking this important step, my country is fulfilling its commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding signed in Ottawa in 1995 and makes a significant, substantial contribution towards achieving global nuclear safety. It was a difficult decision for my country, both in view of the condition of the national economy, especially of the energy sector, and in view of the social consequences of the power plant's closure for the personnel of the power plant and for people whose lives are closely linked to the Chernobyl nuclear power station. Against this background, it is particularly important that the draft resolution sends a strong message of the international community's support for Ukraine's historic decision.</div>
	<div class="p">To address the problems arising from the closure of the power plant, Ukraine needs substantial resources, which, unfortunately, it is incapable of mobilizing alone. The international community has already done a great deal to assist Ukraine in mitigating and minimizing the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, and we sincerely appreciate its assistance. At the same time, the present draft underlines the importance of continued international assistance to Ukraine to cope with the range of newly emerging economic and social problems stemming from the closure of the Chernobyl plant.</div>
	<div class="p">The problems associated with the nuclear plant's closure are not only a Ukrainian internal issue, or an issue for the affected countries. We believe it is a matter deserving global attention. Bearing the main burden of these challenges, Ukraine relies on the understanding and support of the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">The closure of the power plant is not the conclusion of the Chernobyl item on the global agenda; it is, rather, the beginning of a qualitatively new stage in addressing the Chernobyl-related problems. The draft resolution reflects the importance the international community attaches to meeting this challenge.</div>
	<div class="p">We share the view expressed by President Holkeri in this morning's statement that the adoption of the draft resolution will give new impetus to the concerted efforts of the United Nations system to mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me express my sincere hope that draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.60">A/55/L.60</a> will gain the broadest possible support and will be adopted by consensus.</div>

	<div class="p">In its preambular part, the draft resolution refers to General Assembly resolutions 51/30 F of 13 December 1996 and 53/1 F of 16 November 1998 on special emergency economic assistance to the Comoros and to the report of the Secretary-General on that subject, noting in particular the suggestion of the Secretary-General that <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-1">resolution 53/1</a> F should be referred to the Economic and Social Council with a view to initiating a reconstruction and rehabilitation programme so as to lay the groundwork for national economic recovery on a sound basis.</div>
	<div class="p">By the first operative paragraph, the General Assembly would take note <i>with satisfaction</i> the report of the Secretary-General on emergency economic assistance to the Comoros.

	<div class="p">Allow me to announce that the delegations of Angola, Argentina, Austria, Benin, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Cape Verde, Colombia, Cyprus, Greece, Nauru, the Republic of Korea, Slovenia and Uganda have also expressed the wish to co-sponsor this draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">This draft resolution addresses the humanitarian relief, rehabilitation and development needs of East Timor. It calls for continued support by the international community to alleviate the humanitarian assistance requirements of East Timor and stresses the urgent need for sustained and enhanced efforts to effectively and comprehensively resolve the question of East Timorese refugees.</div>
	<div class="p">The issue of humanitarian relief is seen in the broader context of the development and reconstruction needs of East Timor in its transition to independence. This draft resolution puts strong emphasis on the need for an enhanced ownership and participation of the East Timorese in all sectors, as well as on capacity-building, and encourages international assistance in such areas as agriculture, infrastructure, health and education.</div>
	<div class="p">The preambular part contains references to relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions; to the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor and to its mandate; to the timely international response to the humanitarian crisis; and to progress achieved in alleviating the humanitarian assistance needs of East Timor. It welcomes the efforts made in this area, recognizes the significant challenges to be faced and emphasizes the need for continued support for the implementation of resettlement and repatriation programmes and for the transition from relief to rehabilitation and development in preparation for independence.</div>
	<div class="p">In its operative part, this draft resolution contains a general encouragement to the international community and United Nations agencies to continue to collaborate to address the remaining humanitarian relief needs and to support the transition to independence. It refers to the participation of the East Timorese in all the phases of reconstruction and to the Donor Meetings in Tokyo, Lisbon and Brussels. A strong emphasis is placed on the need to respond to the issues of food security and agriculture, infrastructure, health services and primary schools in East Timor. It also contains clear references to the need for sustained and enhanced efforts to overcome the question of East Timorese refugees, including their registration, repatriation and resettlement, as well as to the need for a safe and secure working environment in the refugee camps.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, the draft resolution contains a recommendation that the United Nations continue to address the humanitarian, rehabilitation and development needs of East Timor and requests that the Secretary-General prepare a report on the issue for the consideration of the General Assembly at its next session.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to request that the following corrections be made in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.65">A/55/L.65</a> to reflect the agreed text that was submitted to the Secretariat.</div>
	<div class="p">In the second line of operative paragraph 5, after the words "efforts aimed at" and before the words "in, the social, economic and administrative infrastructure", the current language should be replaced by the following phrase: "the enhanced ownership and participation of the eastern Timorese, known as `Timorization', in East Timor, in". With this correction, operative paragraph 5 will read as follows:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"<i>Urges</i> United Nations organizations, the international community and non-governmental organizations to continue their efforts aimed at the enhanced ownership and participation of the eastern Timorese, known as `Timorization', in East Timor, in the social, economic and administrative infrastructure and, in this regard, stresses the need for capacity-building, inter alia, in such areas as education, health, agriculture and rural development, the judiciary, governance and public administration, security and law and order;".</div>
	<div class="p">In line 5 of operative paragraph 13, a comma should be inserted after the words "those refugees" in order for the phrase to read:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"<i>Stresses</i> the urgent need for sustained and enhanced efforts by the Government of Indonesia, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor and the international community to effectively and comprehensively resolve the question of the East Timorese refugees by the repatriation or resettlement of all those refugees, in conditions of safety and security at all stages, and based on their voluntary decisions, through the efforts of the Government of Indonesia to guarantee effective security in the West Timor camps, by the promotion of a credible and internationally observed registration process, and by the promotion and support of reconciliation among all East Timorese;".</div>
	<div class="p">It is our hope that, like last year, when this issue was first taken up, the draft resolution entitled "Assistance for humanitarian relief, rehabilitation and development for East Timor" will be adopted without a vote by the General Assembly.</div>

Since its publication, the following States have joined as sponsors of this draft resolution: Cyprus, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Togo.</div>
	<div class="p">In the current tragic circumstances, the sponsors of this draft resolution would like to stress the particular importance of providing assistance to the Palestinian people.</div>
	<div class="p">Through this draft resolution, the General Assembly expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr. Terje Roed-Larsen. The Assembly also expresses its appreciation to the Member States, United Nations bodies and intergovernmental, regional and non-governmental organizations for their continuous efforts and assistance to the Palestinian people. This text welcomes in particular the meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee held at Lisbon in June 2000. Such meetings allow for the coordination of international assistance efforts to the Palestinian people.</div>
	<div class="p">This effort must continue. That is why the General Assembly calls upon all parties to intensify their assistance in order to meet the urgent needs of the Palestinian people, in accordance with priorities set forth by the Palestinian Authority and with an emphasis on setting up institutions and on capacity-building. In this context, it also urges the international donor community to expedite the delivery of pledged assistance to the Palestinian people. This text also calls upon Member States to open their markets to exports of Palestinian products on the most favourable terms.</div>
	<div class="p">The text reiterates that, in order for assistance to be effective, it is essential that it reach its destination without obstacles. More generally, free movement of persons and goods must be guaranteed. It is important also that the bilateral Paris Protocol on Economic Relations be implemented, so that, in particular, the tax revenues of the Palestinian Authority can be fully and promptly cleared. The Palestinian Authority must be in position to fully benefit from its financial resources.</div>
	<div class="p">In spite of the tragic events in the region, it is the hope of the sponsors that this draft resolution can be adopted by consensus. I wish to thank all parties concerned for the spirit of openness shown during the sometimes difficult negotiation of this text led by the European Union. The adoption without a vote of this substantial draft resolution would represent a positive gesture under the present circumstances. In our view, this gesture would go along the lines of the shared wish for a resumption of the dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.</div>

	Mr. Shacham (Israel)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">This year, as in years past, Israel has joined the consensus on the resolution entitled "Assistance to the Palestinian people", and I would like to explain our position in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p">Israel is committed to the goal of enhancing the economic growth and welfare of the Palestinian people, which we view as an investment in a better future for the people of the region. This goal has translated to a primary component of Israeli policy, which includes direct economic assistance to the Palestinians, cooperation on development and a wide variety of other projects that have yielded substantial results on the ground.</div>
	<div class="p">We welcome the concerted efforts of Member States, international financial institutions and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to aid in the development efforts. Israel has been fully cooperating with the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and the United Nations Children's Fund, as well as with other international organizations, in implementing programmes aimed at improving the living conditions of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</div>
	<div class="p">In this respect, it should be pointed out that Israel shares the hope that the United Nations Special Coordinator in these areas can assist in the crucial sphere of economic growth, enrichment and investment in the future. Israel is ready to cooperate with the Special Coordinator in this sphere.</div>
	<div class="p">Israel's participation in the consensus on the resolution should not be construed as implying any position regarding the present status of the areas referred to as "occupied territories". Additionally, our support does not carry any implication regarding Israel's position on the permanent status of those territories, which, in accordance with all Palestinian-Israeli agreements, is a matter to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians in the framework of the permanent status negotiations, to which we hope to return as soon as possible.</div>
	<div class="p">This year, changes were made in the text of the resolution, referring to the free passage of aid and the free movement for persons and goods. I would like to take this opportunity to stress that despite the recent crisis, Israel has continued and even expanded the free flow of humanitarian assistance and food to the areas under Palestinian Authority administration. In addition, the movement of goods and persons through Israel and Israeli-administered areas is restricted only to the extent that such movement impacts directly on security.</div>
	<div class="p">Also in this year's text, reference was made in paragraph 11 to the need to continue implementation of the provisions of the interim agreements signed between Israel and the Palestinians. We welcome this addition to the text of the resolution. It reinforces our conviction that the Israel-Palestinian interim agreements continue to remain in force until the achievement of the permanent status agreement between ourselves and the Palestinians, which we hope will occur in the near future. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that Israel fully respects and complies with these agreements, including the provisions on the clearance of Palestinian tax revenues, which have already been transferred in full by Israel to the Palestinian Authority for the monthly periods of January to November of this year.</div>
