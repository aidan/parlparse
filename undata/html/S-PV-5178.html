	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">I shall now give the floor to the representative of Brazil, Mr. Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg, in his capacity as head of the Security Council mission to Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">As I understand it, the primary objective of this meeting is to introduce the report of the Security Council mission to Haiti, which took place from 13 to 16 April, which has been circulated as an official document of the Security Council. The visit to Haiti was made in conjunction with a visit by the Economic and Social Council's Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti. This meeting will also provide an opportunity to start the process of gathering Member States' opinions on the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I am informed that Ambassador Allan Rock of Canada, who led the visit by the Economic and Social Council Group, will also present a report on that mission's activities in due course. He will, of course, be presenting his report to the Economic and Social Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank, once again, the Haitian authorities for their hospitality and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Juan Gabriel Valdés, and his team for their support and for the excellent and professional work that they are performing.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The visit to Haiti by the Security Council mission, which I had the privilege to lead, was the first of its type to a Latin American or Caribbean country. The decision to carry it out it was adopted in the course of the open debate on Haiti promoted by the delegation of Argentina during its presidency of the Council in January.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The actions of the mission benefited from high-degree participation. All 15 Council members were represented, 14 by Ambassadors, of which 10 were Permanent Representatives, including the President of the Security Council in April, Ambassador Wang Guangya. In view of its unprecedented nature, the holding of the mission was in itself significant and constitutes a clear indication of the Council's concern and interest with regard to the current crisis in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The mission met with members of the Transitional Government, including Interim President Boniface Alexandre and Interim Prime Minister Gérard Latortue, as well as representatives of the main political parties and of civil society. In addition to staying in Port au Prince, the mission visited the cities of Gonaïves and Cap-Haïtien. In-depth discussions with MINUSTAH personnel helped the mission to enhance its understanding of MINUSTAH's activities and diversified actions in the implementation its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The main conclusion that can be drawn from the visit is that the international community is committed to supporting Haiti today at this decisive turning point in its history with a view to achieving peace and stability, mitigating its immediate social and economic tribulations and assisting it in making progress towards sustainable development, while respecting its sovereignty. In line with that, it cannot and should not act in Haiti's stead. The mission called on Haitians themselves, particularly the Transitional Government, to carry out their State responsibilities and take advantage of this historic opportunity for gaining full ownership of their future.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">The mission report now before the Council contains a detailed description of its activities and findings with regard to security, political transition, elections, human rights, development, the humanitarian situation, institution-building, regional relations and the organization of MINUSTAH.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">I would like briefly to stress the main messages and recommendations which were highlighted in the report. There can be no genuine stability without comparable advances in the creation of a safe and secure environment, in the political dialogue with a view to national reconciliation, in the observance of human rights, and in the promotion of social and economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">Notwithstanding the fact that the deep-seated root causes of unrest in Haiti, including poverty, require a long-term approach, a number of very serious issues must be dealt with in the short and medium term.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">The holding of elections later this year constitutes, indeed, the most pressing and visible challenge for Haitians and the international community in the short term. Free, fair and inclusive elections must take place in accordance with the established timetable. Even though they should not be seen as a universal remedy, elections are essential for the formation of a legitimate Government, thus concluding the political transition period that started more than a year ago.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">In Haiti, the mission stressed that there is no alternative to elections and that all political parties that publicly reject violence should be entitled to participate in the electoral process. The result of the vote should be respected by all actors. In that regard, the mission recalled in its report that, in accordance with the Haitian Constitution, "democratically elected authorities must take office on 7 February 2006" (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2005-302.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/302</a>, para. 67</i>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">The technical and political preparations for the elections should continue to be closely monitored by the Council on a regular basis, to ensure that they remain on track. Additional resources will be required to cover an estimated gap of about $22 million. The mission has strongly encouraged the timely disbursement of funds committed for that purpose.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">MINUSTAH and the Transitional Government should launch a broad-based civic education programme to ensure the broadest possible participation of the Haitian population in the upcoming elections. The mission is of the opinion that there is an urgent need to establish appropriate arrangements for international electoral observation. The mission also supports a long-term dialogue involving all sectors of Haitian society and aimed at developing a common vision of Haiti's future.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">Security must continue to be reinforced to allow free and fair elections that have a large degree of participation by the Haitian population. Special security arrangements may be needed for a limited period in the months preceding and immediately following the elections. Such measures include establishing better coordination procedures between the Haitian National Police and MINUSTAH. The report also stresses the need to ensure more coordination between MINUSTAH's civil police and military components by, inter alia, making the Joint Mission Analysis Cell operational as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">The Transitional Government should accelerate its disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme, with the assistance of MINUSTAH. Members expressed their concern over the reported DDR funding gap, which should be addressed without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">The Haitian National Police must urgently be reformed so that it can gain the trust of citizens and be counted upon to provide public security. Such reform should be planned and implemented by the Transitional Government with the support of MINUSTAH and bilateral partners.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">All political actors must abide by human rights standards without exception. Combating impunity and promoting respect for human rights are urgently being demanded by both the Haitian people and the international community at large.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">The mission stresses the importance of rebuilding Haitian institutions, such as the judicial and penal systems -- many of which are barely functioning -- so that the population can trust State structures. The mission calls upon the international community to provide assistance to that end, including in terms of capacity building. Strong additional measures to assist the judicial system must be considered with the Haitian authorities. MINUSTAH's mandate should be amended to allow international experts to assist and participate in that effort as may be required.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">Rapid implementation of quick-impact projects, specially those that create large numbers of jobs, would also help to increase participation in the elections by raising the self-confidence of the Haitian population.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">The mission renews its appeal for the accelerated disbursement of the funds pledged by international financial institutions since the International Donors Conference on Haiti of July 2004, and strongly supports the holding of the follow-up to the Cayenne donor conference, preferably no later than July 2005. It calls on all donors to resume full cooperation with Haiti by, among other things, supporting the priority areas identified by the Transitional Government, namely, infrastructure, road repair and construction, energy generation and transmission, reforestation and the management of water resources.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa22">The Ad Hoc Advisory Group of the Economic and Social Council could play an important role in establishing, along with Haitian authorities, a long-term institution-building and development strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa23">In order to improve the Haitian population's understanding of MINUSTAH's mandate and its role in Haiti, the mission recommends that MINUSTAH urgently develop and implement a proactive communications and public relations strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa24">Allow me now to make a few comments in my national capacity. I notice that the list of speakers already contains the names of other delegations wishing to speak.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa25">I would like to point out that the most urgent task we face today is to ensure the minimum conditions necessary to guarantee the success of the transition period in Haiti, thereby taking the first step towards long-term recovery. In line with that, and taking into account a common understanding regarding the need for a long-term United Nations presence in Haiti, Brazil believes that a 12-month extension in MINUSTAH's next mandate is now required.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa26">Despite the substantive improvement in the security situation, the environment in Haiti still remains volatile. Given the history of violence during previous elections, Brazil believes that security arrangements may be needed for a limited period in connection with the elections. Given the nature of potential threats in Haiti, we believe that United Nations civilian police should enhance its participation in the provision of security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa27">It is imperative to ensure adequate funds to carry out the DDR programme. It is also urgent to expedite the reform of the Haitian National Police, with emphasis on providing adequate training and equipment in accordance with internationally accepted standards. Nevertheless, there can be no sustainable progress in that area if there is no coordinated reform of the judicial system. International experts and capacity-building programmes could play a role in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa28">As to the political sphere, the Security Council should continue to insist on, and support, the holding of free and fair elections in accordance with the agreed timetable, and the subsequent taking of office by the newly elected authorities. Potential interested international observers should be deployed, with a view to ensuring respect for democratic standards.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa29">In the economic sphere, it is essential to speed up the implementation of quick-impact projects and to establish a long-term strategy towards sustainable development in the country. Priority areas identified by Haitians themselves should fully be taken into account.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa30">Finally, I wish once again to thank my colleagues in the Council for giving me the opportunity to lead the Security Council's mission to Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Sardenberg for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">I invite Council members who wish to take the floor to so indicate to the Secretariat as of now. I would also like to encourage representatives inscribed on the speakers list for today's debate to limit their oral statements to five minutes and to circulate their full statements in writing.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mayoral</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">I would first of all like to congratulate you publicly, Madam President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council. I would also like to commend you on the manner in which you are presiding over our debates. I would also like to express my delegation's gratitude to the Chinese delegation and Ambassador Wang for the excellent manner in which they guided the Council's activities last month.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">With respect to the topic at hand, my delegation wishes first to thank the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Brazil, Ambassador Ronaldo Sardenberg, for his report, in which he clearly sets out the activities, findings and recommendations of last month's mission to Haiti, in which I had the honour to participate. I also wish to make special note of the leadership and excellent manner in which my friend Ambassador Ronaldo Sardenberg undertook all his tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">The Security Council's visit was an excellent opportunity for all its members to have direct contact with the main political, religious and civil actors in Haiti, as well as with personnel of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Everyone knows that Haiti is at a very delicate and critical juncture for its institutional development, and is perhaps at a decisive moment in its history.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">We believe that the United Nations Mission should help the Haitian people to achieve peace and stability by cooperating in the reconstruction of its democratic institutions and in development programmes. In that context, I reiterate that, while the political, economic and social problems besetting Haiti are far from resolution, we believe that the country's situation would surely be even more serious and tragic if the United Nations had not acted. It is essential, in our opinion, to guarantee the security conditions necessary to the normal development of the election process to begin on 8 October with the election of local authorities and to continue in November with the presidential election. To that end, the military and police contingents should be expanded during the electoral period and until the inauguration of the new democratic Government, scheduled for February 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">We believe that MINUSTAH and its leaders should ensure that the elections are free, fair, inclusive and open to all political parties that publicly renounce violence. The international presence should be coordinated by mobilizing observers to cooperate in the registration process already under way, as well as in the voting and tallying of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">We also believe that it is indispensable to provide assistance in rebuilding State institutions -- in particular in the reform of the judiciary and penal systems, which are fundamental to combating impunity and ensuring respect for due process and the defence of human rights -- through the measures being sought by the Haitian people and the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">We must reiterate the urgency of the need for the funds that have been pledged by the international donors to be disbursed in order to implement development projects in the fields of infrastructure, energy, sanitation, communications and the environment and thus to create the necessary conditions for the inhabitants of the island to enjoy a minimum level of well-being and, most importantly, to enable them to see that the United Nations Mission is there to help the Haitians to launch their economic recovery and resume their development. The reconstruction of the Haitian economy, the recovery of democratic institutions and the restoration of a safe environment based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are fundamental prerequisites for reversing the current situation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, I wish to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Juan Gabriel Valdés, and his team for their support for the Security Council mission. I extend my praise to all MINUSTAH personnel for the professional manner in which they are discharging their obligations in extremely difficult conditions. In that context, I was proud to witness the laudable work being carried out by the various military contingents in Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Holliday</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Sardenberg for his leadership of the Security Council mission and his informative presentation. We, too, would like to salute the efforts of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and the personnel that the United Nations has on the ground in Haiti for their hard work and dedication.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">My colleague, Ambassador Patterson, represented the United States on the mission, and when she came back she mentioned that one of the things that particularly struck her was the lack of a functioning judiciary. She noted that, without a proper judiciary and penal system, the reform of the Haitian National Police will never achieve real success. Haitian interlocutors informed mission representatives that the backlog of cases is such that most of those imprisoned and awaiting trial in Haiti have already been incarcerated for longer periods of time than if they had been tried and found guilty.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">We find this situation unacceptable. While there have been and are some efforts under way to help build the Haitian judicial system, we believe that they are insufficient. We have asked the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations to discuss with judicial reform experts, and in particular with several experienced international judges who will soon depart East Timor, the possibility of undertaking an assessment of Haiti's judicial system. We hope that other members agree that the Haitian judiciary is a problem that must be solved, in conjunction with police reform, and that an assessment would be a good first step.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahiga</span> <span class="nation">Tanzania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">I, too, would like to thank Ambassador Sardenberg of Brazil for his report and for his leadership during our recent visit to Haiti. The Security Council mission to Haiti was a reaction to the deepening crisis in the country, a product of a multitude of problems besetting Haiti and its people over a long period of time.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) is the fifth United Nations mission to Haiti since 1995, four of which were during Aristide's time. All of them have been rated as prematurely terminated and superficially successful. This time around, MINUSTAH should be enabled to make a difference by adequately stabilizing the country and laying a foundation for a comprehensive peacebuilding strategy that addresses the societal crisis in Haiti, rooted in its history, society and culture.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">The entry of MINUSTAH into Haiti was a significant event, as it brought that country once again to the centre of international attention. Not only was MINUSTAH'S entry slow, but some of its resources had to be diverted to other pressing humanitarian needs in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">After a slow start with deployment and operating under very difficult circumstances, MINUSTAH is steadily stabilizing the country. The level of violence is being contained to bring a modicum of stability in which the Transitional Government can operate and relative security to the civilian population. The major continuing threats to security that need to be addressed come from elements of the former armed forces and various armed gangs with different political and criminal agendas. MINUSTAH is working with a deficient National Police which needs major reforms, from recruitment and training to revamping its operational capacity and professionalization of its work ethic.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">While MINUSTAH's tactical intelligence should be improved for its stabilizing function, the Transitional Government needs to show more commitment to the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme. In a country where there has been no classical peace agreement and where there is a culture of owning firearms, the DDR programme is particularly challenging. The buying back of guns is not the correct approach; rather, engaging former members of the military and the armies of unemployed youth in short-term and long-term productive social and economic projects may be more realistic.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">The principle of the rule of law has long been compromised in Haiti, as evidenced by the failure to bring powerful criminals to justice, the politicization of the police and the intimidation of judges. Most important of all, Haiti needs to be set on the path of economic recovery. Messages of self-reliance and empowerment are needed at this stage. The role of the region and of the wider international community in assisting Haiti would be enhanced by the commitment of the people to own the process of their development. The Government should finally be willing to listen to the genuine concerns of Haitian nationals, including those in the diaspora. Their opinions will go a long way towards bringing about an atmosphere of trust and understanding, which is so essential in the building of their motherland.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">The national dialogue that has begun is essential for reconciliation and political accommodation. It should be more inclusive and should continue after the elections. The opposition must become part of the mainstream political dialogue. It must also display a convincing interest in the social and economic advancement of the Haitian people. At the moment, the opposition reflects a large number of fractured and superficially united political parties. They have chosen to be obstructive at a time when a sizeable part of the population is willing to be part of the dialogue and to participate in the coming elections.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">The elections in Haiti will be an essential starting point for a new political dispensation in the country. They need to be well prepared and carried out within the agreed time frame. The current political momentum towards the elections should be maintained. As important as security is now, during the elections and after the elections, voters need to be motivated to see promise in the future of their country.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">Employment-generating projects should be initiated as part of the stabilization effort and as a foundation for the reconstruction effort in the post-election period. What is required is coordinated disbursement of the pledges already on paper under the Interim Cooperation Framework. The donor community should pay particular attention to this important requirement for Haiti. The recent international conference held in Cayenne offered great promise. The pledges made should be disbursed to finance some quick-win projects in this interim period in order to sustain the political tempo towards the elections and beyond them.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">It should be stressed once again that poverty has been the root cause of instability in Haiti. Conditions should be put in place to create a political climate that inspires the confidence of future investors in Haiti. Public investment in essential sectors now would not only respond to the most urgent needs of the population, but also meet infrastructural requirements for future investors. Road-building, electricity generation and environmental restoration are areas that require immediate attention.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">In conclusion, in the current peacekeeping mission, there are ample opportunities to sow the seeds for a sustainable peacebuilding phase. The case for establishing a Peacebuilding Commission to steer Haiti through the next phase could not be stronger.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mercado</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">We join other members in congratulating you, Madam, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May. We also congratulate Ambassador Wang Guangya and the rest of the Chinese delegation on their successful presidency during the month of April. In addition, we would like to thank the delegation of Brazil for preparing the report of the Security Council mission to Haiti (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-302.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/302</a>) and to pay tribute to the outstanding leadership of Ambassador Sardenberg. The well organized four-day mission that he led gave all of us a chance to view a country in serious trouble.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Let me also take this opportunity, on behalf of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and the people of the Philippines, to thank the Secretary-General, the Security Council, the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and the Transitional Government of Haiti for their statements of sympathy and condemnation in connection with the death of a Filipino peacekeeper at the hands of gunmen in the slums of Cité Soleil. Ironically, the Security Council was in Haiti during that time. It was the first combat death of a Filipino peacekeeper in a United Nations peace operation. That death, however, will not deter the Philippines from continuing its participation in MINUSTAH.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The Security Council mission to Haiti was an eye-opener for all of us. What we saw first-hand in Haiti was a sad reminder of the reality that all is not well in that country. More than a year after the international community jumped in with its lifeline, Haiti continues to struggle in a sea of violence and despair.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">Although the mission did not bring with it a cure-all formula for Haiti's myriad problems, we came with a message of hope for the country and its people. Our visit there was the strongest message that the Council could convey to the Haitian people regarding the long-term commitment of the international community to give ordinary Haitians the chance to live normal lives free from the violence, poverty and oppression with which they have been conjoined since birth.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Security, or the lack of it, remains our most serious concern. Although Haiti is more peaceful compared with the same period last year as a result of MINUSTAH reaching its authorized force level, the situation remains volatile. Almost regularly, United Nations peacekeepers receive small-arms fire from the admixture of armed political partisans, criminals, street youths and former members of the military, who also subject ordinary Haitians to their own campaigns of terror.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The Philippines has been an advocate of more robust rules of engagement for United Nations peacekeepers since the international community again came to Haiti's rescue last year. An increased force level with a more robust posture and clearly demarcated responsibilities would allow MINUSTAH to move quickly and effectively to neutralize elements that continue to pose a danger to the security and stability of Haiti. Disarming those armed elements will have to be pursued in conjunction with an effective disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme if we are to look forward not only to the holding of fair and peaceful elections before the end of the year, but also to the delivery of much-promised economic and development assistance to Haitians.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Human rights violations also remain a serious concern, and concrete steps must be undertaken by the Interim Government to put an end to illegal arrests and detentions and to extrajudicial executions in order to improve the country's human rights record. The Haitian National Police, which has been accused of human rights abuses, will also have to be retrained and reformed to bring it up to professional standards.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Lastly, my delegation believes that more effort is needed to pursue national reconciliation. As I speak, former Prime Minister Yvon Neptune hovers near death as a result of a hunger strike to protest his continued detention over what he says are trumped-up charges. We call on the Interim Government to consider, as a gesture of reconciliation, withdrawing the charges filed against him.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">The task ahead for us in Haiti is not easy, but we have no choice. We went in, and we must finish the job this time.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dumitru</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I, too, should like to take this opportunity to reiterate publicly our congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May. We wish also to express our gratitude to Ambassador Wang Guangya and his team for the exemplary way in which they conducted the business of the Council during the month of April.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Romania fully associates itself with the statement that the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg will be making on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">I should therefore like to make only a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">First, I should like to thank Ambassador Sardenberg for the outstanding way in which he led this first Security Council mission to Haiti following the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1542(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1542 (2004)</a>. His in-depth knowledge of the subject enabled the Council's message to be conveyed forcefully and clearly to the various stakeholders.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">For Romania, the mission had special importance. The situation that prevailed in Haiti at the beginning of 2004 was one of the first crises that Romania, as a newly elected member of the Council, addressed and acted on jointly with the other members of the Council. Almost a year later, we have seen that our decisions and the steps taken on that basis have started to bear fruit, leading to positive changes in the field, beginning with the security situation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">In that context, Council members were able to assess first-hand the excellent work being done by the leadership and the personnel of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">The outcome of the mission, contained in the recommendations of the report, once again makes clear the value of field missions conducted by the Council. The broad and coherent vision that the Council mission's approach inspired with regard to Haiti's present and future has been supplemented by the priority given to the recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">The overall experience gained by a number of countries in transition, including Romania, has shown that elections are the indispensable primary stage for ushering in political stability, closely followed by other components of the transitional process. In the particular case of Haiti, in the light of the challenges that need to be met in order to meet the deadline of the 2005 elections, we support the emphasis placed by the Council mission on the responsibilities that are incumbent not only on the Transitional Government but also on the political forces and on civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">The experience of countries that have been through transitions -- sometimes complex and painful ones -- towards democracy, the rule of law and democratization also makes clear that long-term efforts are required at several levels -- political, economic and in terms of the prevailing mindset. Therefore, while we fully support the view that success in Haiti depends on a long-term, multidimensional involvement by the international community and above all by the United Nations, there is, however, another condition that needs to be met in order to prevent history from repeating itself in that country, which has experienced so many false starts.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">At this time, it is important in particular that the internal Haitian stakeholders who are the international community's partners act in good faith and commit themselves unreservedly in both political and practical terms.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">Accordingly, we believe that the continuing fragility in the situation is due largely to the marked absence of trust which continues to prevail among the political leaders of the various groups and communities in Haiti. Absolute poverty, impunity, the absence of hope and a lack of education -- affecting primarily young people -- makes the atmosphere in Haiti a very toxic one, full of hatred, which in turn leads to self-destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa12">Unfortunately, it seems that, even at the subregional level, confidence has not been completely restored. The Security Council must furthermore encourage the full normalization of the relations between Haiti and the Caribbean countries. The Haitian Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed us about positive steps in that respect. In addition, the representative of the Caribbean Community in Port-au-Prince told us about a number of projects that the subregional organization is implementing in Haiti. All of this can only increase the synergy of regional cooperation, with a view to a speedier improvement in the situation in Haiti. Latin American countries are providing most of MINUSTAH's military personnel, and the Organization of American States is equally involved in preparing for the elections, in close cooperation with MINUSTAH.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa13">Finally, we hope that, during the thematic debate that the Romanian presidency of the Security Council intends to hold in October, the case of Haiti will be presented as a success story -- the result of cooperation among the United Nations and regional organizations.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De La Sablière</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I, too, would like first to thank our colleague, Ambassador Sardenberg, for his briefing and to congratulate him also on having taken the initiative of leading this important Security Council mission, which I believe was very useful. Personally, I gained a wealth of knowledge about the situation in Haiti. I was able to appreciate the work being done by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), whose task, at the beginning, was somewhat difficult. However, we have seen today that the mission has in fact been doing outstanding work. We also appreciated all of the work being done by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, our former colleague, Ambassador Juan Gabriel Valdéz, who, I would reiterate, is doing an outstanding job in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">We were also able, I believe, thanks to the excellent guidance provided by our President, to clearly convey the message we wished to send to Haiti, and we made recommendations that I believe will be useful for the work of the Security Council. I will not go into all of the recommendations made by the mission, because I think that they are clear and well adapted to the situation there; indeed, we support them fully.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">I should like, however, to stress one point, that is, the efforts that now need to be made with regard to the local, legislative and presidential elections to take place this fall. Those elections -- and this was stressed by the mission rather frequently during the visit -- have to be held according to schedule. They have to be free and fair and open to all political parties that have renounced violence, and they should permit the participation of as many people as possible. That is the immediate challenge for Haitians and indeed for the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">In order properly to meet that challenge, I believe that we need to take action in three main areas. The first step that needs to be taken is to strengthen security, so that the elections can take place in the best possible conditions. In a few days' time, we will be considering Secretariat proposals on that subject. In addition to a possible increase in personnel, we need to ensure that the personnel already present there, in particular civilian police personnel, is properly used.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Secondly, we believe that we should as soon as possible implement quick-impact development projects. We discussed this repeatedly during the mission, and it is the subject of one of the recommendations: that tangible improvements should be made to the living conditions of the people, and that they need to be given hope.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">In that regard, we welcome Canada's holding in mid-June of a follow-up meeting to the Cayenne conference held at the initiative of Foreign Minister Barnier of France. We believe that all donors should immediately resume their full cooperation with Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">Thirdly and finally, we need to closely follow the preparations for the elections, in particular voter registration and civic education efforts for the population.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">Elections are a necessary step for ensuring stability in Haiti but in themselves are not sufficient. In parallel, we must pursue with the Haitian authorities the rebuilding of institutions, in particular the judicial system, and promote the sustainable development of the country.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vassilakis</span> <span class="nation">Greece</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I would like to express our deep appreciation to our colleague, the Permanent Representative of Brazil, for his skilful leadership of the Security Council mission to Haiti -- although I was not present in the mission -- at this particularly important junction in Haiti's long quest for security, political and social stability and development. It was both appropriate and necessary that the international community, through the Security Council, conveyed to the people and the leaders of Haiti its long-term commitment and continued support to their legitimate dreams and aspirations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">We wish to extend our thanks to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). We commend it for its stabilizing role and for the work it carries out under extremely difficult circumstances. At the same time, we unequivocally condemn all attacks against it and against other international personnel, especially those with a humanitarian task. Last but not least, we should not forget the tireless efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Valdés.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">The report before us (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-302.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/302</a>) accurately reflects the Security Council's thoughts and observations with respect to the situation in Haiti and the way forward. I shall make only three short points.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">First, the political landscape in Haiti is highly complex. A truly representative and legitimate Government and the smooth transfer of power on 7 February 2006 are crucial first steps towards the normalization of the situation and the stabilization of the country. Elections must take place according to the established timetable, and they must be free, fair, democratic and open to all political parties that publicly renounce violence.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">Secondly, the problems faced by Haiti are huge and deeply rooted. Solutions are not easy. No one is expecting those problems to be miraculously solved by an election process, a political dialogue or international assistance alone. Institutional reform and development, especially in the judicial and penal sectors; respect for human rights and the rule of law, especially with respect to impunity and the implementation of the rules of due process; dealing with ecological disasters; addressing urgent and basic humanitarian needs; and pursuing development goals: these demand long-term hard work and commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Thirdly, poverty has led to violence and instability, which cannot be reversed without injecting massive, immediate aid. We therefore appeal to all donors, big and small, to disburse the funds pledged at the International Donors Conference on Haiti, held in July 2004, and at the Cayenne follow-up meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">As we have said before, MINUSTAH is in Haiti for the long term, and its main role is not limited to security but includes helping, along with United Nations agencies in the country, to foster economic development in the framework of the international community's long-term commitment to the people of Haiti.</p>
</div>

	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Canada.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rock</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">I welcome this opportunity to present the report of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group of the Economic and Social Council on its visit to Haiti, which took place in conjunction with the Security Council mission from 13 to 16 April.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">In recent months, within the Organization, we have discussed the cause of larger freedom: how to ensure freedom from want and fear and freedom to live in dignity. I believe that the Ad Hoc Advisory Group's mission to Haiti, together with that of the Security Council, tangibly demonstrated the importance of that debate. The nexus between development, security and human rights is nowhere more evident than in Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline-spokein" id="pg011-bk03">

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rock</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa01">Ultimately, of course, the chief responsibility for the building of a stable and democratic Haiti rests in the hands of the Haitian people themselves. However, the international community must offer its commitment and support over the long term. The Economic and Social Council itself will have an important contribution to make as the United Nations seeks to play a positive role in the long, challenging work that lies ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa02">Those involved in the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council visits returned, I believe, with a deeper appreciation of the human reality behind the four clusters of the Secretary General's report "In larger freedom" (<a href="../pdf/A-59-2005.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/2005</a>). We saw for ourselves the need to better manage the continuum of support, from relief to recovery to reconstruction to self-sustaining growth development, in a close and mutually beneficial partnership with local stakeholders and with a seamless transition from one stage to another. While that process needs to be sequenced, the planning for recovery should start as relief work begins, and the planning for long-term development should parallel reconstruction activities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa03">That is the challenge that the current Government of Haiti faces. With so many things to do, where and how should one start? As we learned during our short visit, there has been good progress in stabilizing the macroeconomic framework, which is essential for future progress. But for many reasons, there has been a slower start on other urgent needs: on jobs, roads, schools, health, water and sanitation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa04">Our Group's report to the Economic and Social Council recognizes the immense challenges that will face the incoming Government in February 2006. The national report on Haiti's progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals underlines how much needs to be done at the most basic levels. We will therefore propose that the new Government consider anchoring its medium-term planning in a poverty reduction strategy paper based on the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa05">The Group's report will make a series of concise recommendations for consideration by the Economic and Social Council, the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the United Nations country team and the donor community. Let me briefly touch upon some of its central recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa06">We recommend that the Economic and Social Council focus on mechanisms for capacity-building support, playing a role in promoting the socio-economic dimensions of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme, developing a strong advocacy role on poverty and promoting a smooth transition from the United Nations integrated mission to sustained economic development once MINUSTAH's mandate has been fulfilled.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa07">With respect to the United Nations system, we encourage considering the establishment of capacity under the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to develop quick-impact projects, investing in developing the capacity of key ministries and ensuring that the DDR process is complemented by efforts in support of political dialogue, a stronger judiciary, reconciliation and security sector reform.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa08">Looking to donors, we recommend that they develop more flexible and accelerated disbursement processes, align themselves to the maximum extent in support of government-led strategies, harmonize their activities closely and ensure that the DDR process is sustained beyond the departure of MINUSTAH and the end of the Interim Cooperation Framework.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa09">As Haiti turns to the immense challenges it now faces, it will be impossible to do everything at once. There will be hard decisions about where to start and how to sequence efforts. But it will be important to communicate to the people of Haiti where the Government intends to deliver and how it intends to reach all parts of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa10">The international community will need to maintain its engagement for the long term and to resist the temptation to reduce funding when the elections are over. In that respect, the past should be our teacher.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa11">We therefore call on the international community to increase its commitments to Haiti and to be more flexible in doing so. Paperwork should not form a barrier between a good idea and the financing necessary to make it a reality. The Haitian Government must be in a position to make rapid progress in the quality-of-life improvements that Haitians expect.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa12">Underlying ail of this must be a collective decision by Haiti's people and its political class that this is the time to move forward: to begin a national dialogue around the building of a stable country in which citizens enjoy the freedom and economic security we are all committed to promote.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa13">There is one more dimension of the visits by the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council that I should mention before closing. Our simultaneous presence in Haiti -- members of both Councils and representatives of international financial institutions and of troop-contributing countries -- was a prototype of what has been recommended by the Secretary-General as the Peacebuilding Commission. I believe that the unique integrated perspective that the visit afforded, the constructive working relationship among all those who took part and the significance of the recommendations that emerged from the trip all demonstrate the value of a Peacebuilding Commission. This approach makes sense, and I very much hope that Member States will examine our work when they assess that reform proposal.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa14">Let me conclude by expressing gratitude for the support that the Advisory Group received from the Government of Haiti, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of MINUSTAH, the Deputy Special Representative and Humanitarian and Resident Coordinator, the entire United Nations country team and the men and women of MINUSTAH who ensured the security of the Group during its visit, as well as from officials of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank. The Group also wishes to thank the Department of Economic and Social Affairs for its excellent support in facilitating our work.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I call next on the representative of Luxembourg.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hoscheit</span> <span class="nation">Luxembourg</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">For the first time under your presidency of the Council, Madam, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, the candidate countries Turkey and Croatia, the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Serbia and Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the country of the European Free Trade Association Iceland, member of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">At this crucial time for the future of Haiti, the European Union welcomes the opportunity to discuss the findings of the recent mission the Security Council undertook there, on which Ambassador Sardenberg briefed the Council this morning, in conjunction with the mission of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council, whose findings Ambassador Rock has just presented. We feel that three areas need our particular attention at this juncture: the security situation, the upcoming elections and sustainable economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">While the mission is of the view that some measure of progress has been achieved regarding security, including through improved cooperation between the Haitian National Police and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), we note that the overall situation remains fragile. The Haitian National Police is struggling to maintain law and order. An adequate and effective demobilization, disarmament and reintegration programme is still lacking, and we take note of the mission's concerns regarding the firm commitment of the Transitional Government in that regard. The establishment of the National Commission on Disarmament is a welcome first step, but substantial and speedy progress is needed in this field, with the assistance of MINUSTAH, in advance of the elections in the fall.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">The persistence of widespread violence in some areas of the country would pose a serious risk to the elections, as a secure environment is essential for political debate, campaigning and voting. To further assist the Haitian National Police, a temporary increase in the civilian police component of MINUSTAH and an adjustment of its mandate in order to address the increasing security challenges should be considered for the period leading up to the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">The European Union remains gravely concerned at the human rights violations which have been and continue to be committed in Haiti. While a strong police response is needed to restore law and order, it must respect human rights standards. There should be thorough investigations into alleged human rights violations by the Haitian National Police. We call again on the Transitional Government to take the measures necessary to put an end to impunity.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">The European Union welcomes the official launching of the national dialogue by the Interim President. The Union reaffirms that the ongoing crisis in Haiti can be resolved only by peaceful means through a constitutional and inclusive political process. That process must include national dialogue, compromise and reconciliation and must lead to free and fair elections by the end of this year and to the transfer of power to elected authorities by 7 February 2006. All political forces that have renounced violence should be actively encouraged to participate in the national dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">The elections planned for this year will be an essential building block in a long-term effort to rebuild the country. To maintain the necessary momentum, the announced calendar for the elections must be respected. In that context, we are following very closely the voter registration effort currently under way under the supervision of the Organization of American States. As I indicated to the Council in January (see <a href="../html/S-PV-5110.html">S/PV.5110</a>), the European Union is examining the possibility of dispatching an election observer mission to Haiti. To that end, an assessment mission is planned for the beginning of the summer, and 20.5 million has been earmarked to support the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">The Haitian people must be provided with the capacity to ensure the country's long-term stability and prosperity. The European Union is of the view that genuine long-term stability in Haiti requires a strengthened economy and sustainable development. Excluding bilateral contributions by member States, the European Union's pledge made at the Washington donor conference has since been increased to 294 million. The European Union is doing what it can to accelerate disbursements and programme implementation, in order to tangibly improve living conditions and reduce poverty in Haiti. To that end, the European Commission staff in Haiti has been reinforced and procedures for project implementation have been simplified.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">This being said, the projects financed through the European Development Fund require close cooperation with the Haitian authorities, who must implement those projects. The lack of an effectively functioning public administration significantly hampers progress in such projects. In the meantime, the European Union has been concentrating on projects in three areas where the Haitian population will see rapid benefits, including through job creation: infrastructure, especially road construction; education, including rehabilitation of schools; and democratization, in particular through support for elections and for justice-sector reform.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Security and development are interlinked elements of a comprehensive solution to the crisis in Haiti, as illustrated by the fact that the Security Council mission took place in conjunction with that of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council. The European Union supports the view that a long-term United Nations presence is required and acknowledges the need for improved coordination between MINUSTAH and the various development actors in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Let me conclude by reaffirming the European Union's firm commitment to support Haiti in its difficult transition process, both in the short term and in the longer term. At the same time, we share the view that the Haitian people themselves, including the Transitional Government, need to shoulder their responsibilities and take ownership of their own future.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">The delegation of Chile would like to express its appreciation to you, Madam President, and to Denmark for having convened this open meeting to consider the situation in Haiti. We would also like to thank the Permanent Representative of Brazil, Ambassador Ronaldo Sardenberg, for having introduced the report of the Security Council mission to Haiti, which took place from 13 to 16 April.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">The Security Council mission, which was undertaken in conjunction with the mission of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council and was the first such visit to Latin American and Caribbean region, reaffirmed the United Nations commitment to the process of Haiti's political stabilization and economic and social reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">Since last December, the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has nearly attained the military and police strength provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1542(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1542 (2004)</a>, thereby enabling it successfully to carry out a number of operations in Haiti. That progress was achieved in the context of a security situation that remains fragile.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">We therefore agree with the Council that there is a need to implement, without further delay, an in-depth and comprehensive programme of demobilization, disarmament and reintegration (DDR). Bringing peace to Haiti will require the disarmament of the whole of Haitian society, not only those who have served in the army. But disarmament without the reintegration of such forces will certainly not achieve the ultimate objective of consolidating peace.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">In this connection, we consider it of paramount importance that MINUSTAH be provided with the financial resources requested by the Secretary-General so that the effective implementation of the DDR programme can begin as soon as possible, without prejudice to any voluntary contributions that might be made.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">One of the international community's main tasks is to equip Haiti with a police force whose institutional doctrine is founded on respect for the rule of law and the promotion and protection of human rights. Great care must be taken in recruiting and training such a force, which must also be carried out in a transparent manner. That is the only to gain the trust of the citizens.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">When the United Nations forces leave, the National Police will have to be the backbone of the maintenance of the rule of law. We welcome the improved coordination between the military and police components of MINUSTAH and the Haitian National Police, including with regard to joint military operations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">My delegation is pleased to inform the Council that our uniformed police -- the Carabineros de Chile -- signed, on 11 March, a bilateral cooperation agreement with the Haitian National Police. Under that agreement, a delegation of Carabineros worked for 10 days with the Haitian National Police in order to assess the professional requirements of that force.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">We reiterate that efforts to strengthen the police force will prove fruitless if they are not pursued within the context of a total overhaul of the key institutions responsible for enforcing of the rule of law in Haiti, which are currently in a very fragile state. This will require the strengthening of democratic institutions, the reform of the judiciary and the prison system and -- no less important -- the consolidation of political parties and of civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa10">Chile notes with particular interest the Council's recommendation to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations that it undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the security situation in Haiti with a view to determining whether it may be necessary to strengthen the military and police contingents, especially given the crucial need for a secure environment for the forthcoming elections. Those elections are due to be held in a few months' time, and while their success will not in and of itself resolve all of Haiti's problems, a smooth and legitimate electoral process is a necessary condition for progress towards the strengthening of democracy and ensuring the full restoration of the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa11">Chile has thus consistently stressed the urgent need for a broad national dialogue involving all stakeholders in Haitian society that renounce the use of violence. We note with satisfaction that such a dialogue has been initiated by the Haitian authorities -- but that initiative must be supported by efforts to promote the participation of all stakeholders and must extend beyond the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa12">No one today can deny that security and development are inseparable and mutually reinforcing requirements. It is therefore essential that Haiti receive, as soon as possible, the resources pledged at the donors conference that took place in Washington one year ago. Such resources will enable Haiti to address the urgent social needs of its people and to launch medium- and long-term programmes for reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa13">There can be no doubt that the United Nations presence in Haiti should be viewed as a fourth-generation peacekeeping operation whose goals are not limited merely to the suppression of violence. Our collective task will be crowned with success when we make progress towards eradicating the causes of political instability and violence and when Haiti can stand on its own feet. That is precisely why we welcome the fact that the Security Council mission took place in conjunction with that of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group of the Economic and Social Council. That will make possible an integrated approach to Haiti's problems.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa14">Reaffirming our commitment to the Ad Hoc Advisory Group, we endorse the conclusions and recommendations resulting from that mission to Haiti, presented by the Ambassador of Canada, in particular the poverty-reduction strategy, which must include measures for the creation of jobs, reforestation, the protection of the environment, the rehabilitation of infrastructure and the improvement in the quality of public services in the areas of health and education.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa15">In that connection, we also welcome the fact that MINUSTAH is undertaking many quick-impact projects in areas such as education, health, agriculture, combating HIV/AIDS, infrastructure and the promotion of human rights. Those actions will not only directly benefit the Haitian population, but will also improve the image that Haitians have of the United Nations. We therefore urge Member States once again to provide the Mission with the resources that it needs if it is to succeed in its tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa16">Shortly after the conclusion of the joint mission of the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, a delegation from the Foreign Relations and Defence Committees of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies of Chile visited Haiti. Their purpose was to familiarize themselves with the situation in the country and to assess the performance of the Chilean troops there, as well as to identify areas for bilateral cooperation. That is consistent with the national character of the task that my country bas undertaken in Haiti. That is why President Ricardo Lagos is personally committed to ensuring that our National Congress extends the stay of the Chilean forces in that Caribbean country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa17">Today, in reaffirming our commitment to Haiti and its people, we would like to reiterate that, if we want to ensure the United Nations mission does not fail, as it has done in the past, it must be carried out with a view to the long term. We therefore urge the Security Council to renew the mandate of MINUSTAH for a period of no less than 12 months in order to guarantee its continuity throughout the electoral process and the subsequent transfer of power to the new authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa18">Let us not ignore Haiti yet again. It will depend on us, to a large extent, whether its long-suffering people regain their hope for a better future and for a life of dignity, free from fear and want.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Guatemala, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Skinner-Klée</span> <span class="nation">Guatemala</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I would like, first of all, to congratulate Denmark for having assumed the presidency of the Security Council and having organized this open debate, providing countries non-members of the Council with the opportunity to express our views on the fragile situation in Haiti. On behalf of Guatemala, I wish you, Madam President, every success as you preside over the work of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">We are also grateful to Ambassador Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg, Permanent Representative of Brazil and head of the Security Council mission to Haiti, for his comprehensive introduction of the mission's report. We would also like to thank Ambassador Allan Rock, Permanent Representative of Canada, for having led the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council during the joint mission to the island from 13 to 16 April.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">I would like first of all to stress that the work carried out by the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council in connection with post-conflict situations -- one in the area of security policy and the other in the area of humanitarian support for development -- offers an opportunity for very productive action. The joint mission to Haiti and the ongoing support that the two Councils have been providing each other with respect to that country in the fulfilment of their respective mandates attests to that renewed climate of cooperation. Guatemala welcomes that development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">It is even more important to stress that the role of the United Nations is not merely to assist domestic actors to put an end to conflict and, in the case of Haiti, to stabilize the situation. We should be equally effective in providing humanitarian assistance and helping to bring about the establishment of institutions that will make possible long-term development and prevent the resurgence of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">Since the beginning of the crisis in Haiti, my Government has expressed its solidarity with the people of that brotherly country. Moreover, my Government has made known its sincere hope that all political actors in Haiti will find a way to build a true democracy and to create a favourable environment for sustainable development in the country to the benefit of all Haitians. Although the primary responsibility to achieve that rests with Haitians, we also know that that essential goal will be achieved only if the international community promotes an effort towards cooperation that is coordinated, generous and long-term in nature. We believe that the Interim Cooperation Framework, which was developed jointly last year by the Transitional Government and the international community, is an important step in the right direction.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">In keeping with our policy of promoting the peaceful and negotiated resolution of conflicts, the Government of Guatemala has reaffirmed its commitment and readiness to participate in the United Nations Mission Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). A 70-person Guatemalan military police contingent is now in Haiti as our present contribution to MINUSTAH. We would like to express our firm support for the work carried out by MINUSTAH, whose principal military and civilian components are of Latin American origin. Guatemala in particular supports the work of Ambassador Juan Gabriel Valdés, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of MINUSTAH.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">With regard to the reports presented today, we share the concern about the current delicate security situation in Haiti and the conditions regarding the former army, in particular the challenge posed by armed gangs linked to criminal groups. We are also worried about the weakness in the administration of justice and the ongoing problem of insecurity, as they constitute major hurdles confronting the entire Haitian people today.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">For that reason, Guatemala believes that the international community, regional organizations, international financial institutions, agencies, programmes and non-governmental organizations should continue to support the Haitian people in order that it may fully enjoy basic human rights, and that they should support the Transitional Government in investigating the abuses that have taken place so as to put an end to impunity through reform and the strengthening of the National Police and the judicial system, institutions without which the administration of justice is impossible. In that connection, we call upon the Transitional Government to adopt the concrete measures necessary to prevent such acts through effective investigation of complaints and the prosecution of those responsible.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa09">With a view to the preparation and holding of local and presidential elections that are fully participatory, representative, legitimate and in keeping with the existing timetable, we support the basic idea that furthering political dialogue between all groups and actors in Haitian society without exception merits priority attention. We are gravely concerned about the structural, technical and logistical problems described in the relevant report with regard to properly preparing for elections. More worrying yet is the $22 million deficit in the election budget. In that regard, we believe it essential to have sufficient resources available and the necessary technical assistance from the international community -- particularly that of donor countries -- for the successful holding of elections and an orderly transition to a democratic system.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa10">Guatemala would also like to stress the importance of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes. We share the visiting mission's concern not only about the delays in the implementation of the programmes proposed by MINUSTAH but also about the problems in financing those programmes, especially with regard to reintegration.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa11">My delegation must also underscore such fundamental problems as extreme poverty and high rates of illiteracy and malnutrition, which continue to deprive Haitians of basic economic, social and cultural rights and to aggravate the consequences of the non-observance of basic civil and political rights. We recognize that the temporary nature of the Transitional Government means that there will not be enough time to substantially resolve those problems. However, the Government could get some initiatives under way. We therefore urge the Transitional Government, with the cooperation of all social sectors and the support of the international community, to develop and implement a long-term development strategy that makes it possible to address the basic economic and social needs of every Haitian citizen.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa12">With regard to the tasks and challenges facing Haiti and its people, we appeal to the international community, and donor Governments in particular, to provide Haiti with the backing and assistance needed to overcome the difficulties inherited from the past and to move the country towards a future in which the rule of law is fully in place, with democracy and respect for human rights. It is essential that we face the Haitian challenge as a common challenge, and that we meet our duty to demonstrate our solidarity with a country that has been so ill-treated throughout history. We shall continue with our commitment to rebuild and stabilize Haiti in order to make it possible for the Haitian people to be the masters of their own destiny.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Peru.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Rivero</span> <span class="nation">Peru</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">Peru believes it very important that the full Security Council, led by Ambassador Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg, has carried out a working visit to Haiti. That has enabled the Council to get a first-hand view of the situation in that country and of the work being carried out by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) under the mandate of the Security Council. It should also be recalled that the decision to visit Haiti was adopted at the open meeting very aptly organized on 12 January by the delegation of Argentina during its presidency of the Security Council (<a href="../html/S-PV-5110.html">S/PV.5110</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">We also believe that the simultaneous visit of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council was very appropriate, as was the fact that some of its meetings in Haiti were carried out jointly with the Security Council mission. That modality has not often been employed, but it enriches our understanding of the problems besetting countries such as Haiti. In addition to the Security Council's task of maintaining peace and security, that approach enables the Economic and Social Council to promote the development agenda that will make it possible to rebuild such countries.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">My delegation fully shares the Security Council mission's assessment of the aspects it addressed during its visit and endorses its recommendations. I shall therefore confine my remarks to a few points.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">As we can see from reading the report of the Security Council mission to Haiti, there is not yet a minimal social contract in Haiti to underpin the existence and authority of the State. My delegation believes that that finding justifies two courses of action. First of all, the forthcoming renewal of MINUSTAH's mandate should be for an initial period of 12 months. MINUSTAH is today the guarantor of minimum conditions of peace and security for the Haitian population. It must therefore be given a timeline that guarantees the continuity of its activities, and must have the resources it needs to provide security for the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">The second course of action pertains to the need for all of Haiti's political and social forces to be incorporated into the political process of dialogue and reconciliation currently under way. Absent agreement on the part of Haitians themselves to establish a genuine social contract among themselves, it is difficult to imagine that the current critical situation can be overcome.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">It is time for the efforts of the international community and all friends of Haiti, both in this hemisphere and elsewhere, to converge resolutely on the goal of achieving a social pact in Haiti. It is not, of course, the responsibility of the international community -- and even less so in the current circumstances -- to take a stand in support or rejection of any particular political actor or grouping in Haiti or to express value judgements of the historical and social process that has mired the Haitian population in the worst living conditions in our hemisphere. The international community must be unconditionally committed to securing a social agreement leading to political viability in Haiti. Such a social agreement is undoubtedly the main guarantee of a successful outcome of the electoral process to be launched in Haiti in October and of the elections being carried out in an atmosphere in which democracy and respect for the voice of the voters transcend the violence and legitimate the mandate of the elected authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">As the Latin American heads of State reiterated at the Rio summit last November, the reconstruction and development of Haiti are a regional priority for our countries. We are therefore gratified by the region's response in support of Haiti. In Peru's case, that response includes supplying troops to MINUSTAH. In recent months, the Peruvian contingent deployed in Jacmel has been used for various operations in Port-au-Prince, Cité Soleil and other areas of Haiti where violence and gang activity are widespread. We therefore appreciate the recognition offered by the Force Commander of the conduct of our contingent, and deplore the losses incurred by MINUSTAH's military personnel, which highlight the critical and sensitive situation prevailing in Haiti. Peru has been and will remain committed to Haiti and, in response to the request of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, will send an additional contingent to double the number of troops it presently has in MINUSTAH.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">The Peruvian delegation feels that the restoration of the Transitional Government's control over civil order throughout the country is critical to Haiti's stability. There can be no substitute for that important task, and we must therefore provide the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme with the necessary momentum and, above all, resources. In the case of Haiti, however, insecurity arising from the existence of illegal armed groups requires a special political effort towards inclusion. That is why consolidating a sustainable level of security requires the restoration of the social contract and simultaneous action on various fronts, especially with respect to the country's political, institutional and economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">The political and institutional development of Haiti cannot be dissociated from economic and social development. That is why a comprehensive, long-term strategy is required to address the challenges facing the country. It is undeniably the fundamental responsibility of the Haitian Government and society to make the internal efforts necessary to laying those foundations, but it is also a fact that Haiti does not have the resources to deal with those challenges on its own. Today more than ever, Haiti needs international cooperation in terms of financial and technical support. In its own efforts, Haiti needs the resolute support of the United Nations, the donor community and the international financial institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">We trust that, in the coming weeks, the international community and Haiti's friends in America and on other continents will discharge their responsibility for helping Haitian society to restore its social contract. We cannot be divided on that issue.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Løvald</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">The deterioration of the situation in Haiti gives reason for concern. Haiti now needs both to restore security and to implement investment and aid in order to lay the foundation for the country's reconstruction and the strengthening of the rule of law. A concerted effort by the United Nations, regional organizations and the international community is essential to achieving that.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">Norway would like to take this opportunity to express its strong support for the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Valdés, and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in preparing for fair and transparent elections to take place in November. We would also like to underline the importance of the electoral assistance of the Organization of American States for Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">Lasting and sustainable peace depends on the existence of legitimate national authorities. The upcoming elections offer the possibility of a new start so that Haiti can begin addressing its multitude of challenges. Priorities right now are the restoration of security and successful elections.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">There is a strong need to promote and facilitate national reconciliation in an open and inclusive process. Haiti needs to develop a political climate and a culture of dialogue, tolerance and respect. There is no alternative to dialogue and compromise in meeting the challenges facing the country. Good governance based on democracy, respect for human rights, sound economic management and accountability must come from within.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">In recent years, Norway has been supporting and encouraging political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation. We remain committed to facilitating venues for political dialogue and consensus-building in an open and inclusive process. We believe that, in a long-term perspective, peace and prosperity can be secured only through political dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">Despite the efforts of the United Nations, regional organizations and others, the situation remains difficult and there are no signs that give reason to expect significant improvement in the near future. It is Norway's view that, in a short-term perspective, there is a lack of timely, adequate and secure financing enabling MINUSTAH to fulfil its mandate, including disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities, and that this must be addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">It is our view that, as we approach the September summit, the situation in Haiti underlines the need for a new approach to peacebuilding. We thus encourage all Member States to bear that in mind when considering the proposal of establishing a United Nations-led, consolidated peacebuilding mechanism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sealy</span> <span class="nation">Trinidad and Tobago</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the States members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) that are Members of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">Our delegations welcome the report of the Security Council mission on its visit to Haiti, which it undertook in conjunction with that of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council. The conjoint mission was the first time either of those two principal organs of the United Nations had sent political missions to Latin America and the Caribbean and clearly demonstrates, given the high level of representation in both missions, the profound interest in and concern which the international community has with respect to the grave political, economic, social and security crisis with which the people of Haiti are currently confronted. Nowhere is the intrinsic link between security and development more clearly evident than in the current Haitian situation.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">The mission's report describes in graphic detail the challenges confronting Haitian society in many spheres and at varying levels. Insecurity or the lack of personal safety continues to be a predominant feature of the Haitian landscape, caused in no small part by the actions of illegally armed groups. One can only express the hope that, through the firm resolve of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), together with the Haitian National Police, not only will there be an increased sense of security for Haitians as they go about their daily business, but that there will be such a degree of stability and security as to enable the political/electoral process, which has just begun with the registration of voters, to lead to the holding of free, fair, transparent and inclusive elections, the results of which would lead to a democratically elected Government that can command widespread and universal recognition and support.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">CARICOM delegations would therefore support the recommendations of the Security Council mission which seek to ensure that the electoral timetable is adhered to, that the required funding is provided to the Provisional Electoral Council and that MINUSTAH's military troop and civilian police strength is reinforced, as appropriate, so as to guarantee the peaceful conduct of these crucial elections, scheduled for October and November. CARICOM delegations note that the electoral timetable envisages the inauguration of a newly elected Government in Haiti on 7 February 2006, and they would be prepared to support the continued presence of MINUSTAH in Haiti after the holding of the elections and for such time as would provide that new Government with the necessary security and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">The report of the Security Council mission to Haiti (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-302.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/302</a>) addresses a number of other pressing issues, including the need for the observance of human rights. CARICOM supports the view that respect for human rights contributes to reinforcing stability and security and reiterates that the interim administration has a special responsibility in adhering to human rights, in particular respect for fundamental political and civil rights and due process. These should be addressed as a matter of urgency in order to restore the confidence of all Haitians in the law, the police and the judiciary.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">In that connection, CARICOM wishes to draw to the attention of the Council the situation of Mr. Yvon Neptune, former constitutional Prime Minister of Haiti, who, after voluntarily turning himself in to the Interim Government in June 2004, has yet to be brought to trial. That is in violation of procedures under the Haitian Constitution. CARICOM heads of State or Government, meeting in February of this year, stated that the indefinite detention of Lavalas leaders and activists -- of which the detention of Mr. Neptune is the most glaring example -- can be construed only as arbitrary detention on the basis of political affiliation. These persons must either be afforded their right of judicial process or be released forthwith. We are particularly concerned that the prolonged detention of Mr. Neptune has led to the deterioration of his health, with potentially tragic consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">CARICOM continues to stress the importance of inclusiveness in the political process in order to promote national unity and an atmosphere conducive to free and fair elections.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">The Security Council mission's report also addresses to some extent the dire socio-economic conditions facing Haiti's population, and note has been taken of the observation that Haiti is unlikely to achieve any of the Millennium Development Goals before the year 2015. CARICOM delegations consider that the international donor community must live up to its obligations and responsibilities to Haiti, a least developed country, and, in order to address the most central of all the Millennium Development Goals -- halving by 2015 the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty -- must provide it over the short, medium and long term with meaningful and substantial international cooperation assistance such as would enable the people of Haiti to improve their quality of life and would bequeath to future generations a country that is capable of supporting itself economically and of providing for its own domestic law and order, and that guarantees to its people good governance in both the economic and the political spheres. In the immediate future, however, priority attention should be devoted to helping Haiti build the necessary absorptive capacity to utilize most effectively the assistance that is being provided by the donor community.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, CARICOM delegations wish to assure the members of the Security Council that CARICOM Governments remain committed over the long term to securing the requisite political, social and economic progress for Haiti. In that regard, we would urge the international donor community and the United Nations system through its funds, programmes and agencies to collectively provide all the necessary support and assistance to Haiti, thus enabling it to rise above and overcome the tremendous challenges it is currently facing.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Spain.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">As this is the first time that I have spoken before the Security Council in May, I should like at the outset to congratulate you, Madam, and Denmark on your assumption of the presidency of the Council and to wish you every success in guiding its work. I also wish to thank you for convening this public meeting to discuss the situation in Haiti following the mission dispatched by the Security Council and led by Ambassador Sardenberg of Brazil in conjunction with the mission of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council, chaired by Ambassador Rock of Canada.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">Spain fully subscribes to the statement made by the representative of Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union. I shall therefore limit myself to a few supplementary observations.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">Spain's active commitment to stability, democratization and development in Haiti is expressed through our participation in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) with a military contingent working in close cooperation with one from Morocco and with a civilian police contingent, as well as through our activities in the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council, in whose recent mission to the country we participated. The two missions -- of the Security Council and of the Economic and Social Council -- highlighted the complementarity of those organs when they address complex crises such as the one in Haiti. We agree with the recommendations resulting from the mission, which are set out in the report before the Council (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-302.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/302</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">The elections planned for the end of the year are undoubtedly one of the most important short-term challenges for the people of Haiti and for the international community. However, they cannot, in and of themselves, solve the country's problems, which also require long-term social, economic and institutional development efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">All political parties that renounce violence must be able to participate in free, transparent and inclusive elections in which there is the greatest possible participation by the people. We believe that, during the electoral process, the presence of international observers and the strengthening of security -- the absence of which would pose higher risks for the success of the process -- would be highly appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">With a view to those objectives, the national dialogue begun on 7 April by Interim President Boniface Alexandre -- which dialogue should be supported -- should immediately serve to create an inclusive political scenario that will ultimately permit the governability of the country. The Haitian political forces have a special responsibility to ensure that the dialogue moves forward before the electoral process begins and that it continues after the installation of the new Government. The national dialogue should make it possible to define the political framework needed for the implementation of long-term development objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">The solution to Haiti's fragile situation is not purely military in nature. However, we all know that there can be no development without security. The two are interlinked and require progress in parallel. We agree with the recommendation that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations review the security situation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">In that context, we believe that a new concept of operations should be adopted for MINUSTAH through a revised model of its civilian police component, with appropriate support for its military personnel -- all of this to take place before the electoral process gets under way. We should also improve the coordination of MINUSTAH's civilian police component and strengthen its cooperation with a reformed Haitian National Police. The Mission should also be endowed with the required resources to improve its intelligence-gathering capabilities and enhance its internal coordination with respect to the civilian police.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">It is clear that MINUSTAH is playing a very important role in terms of stability and deterrence, which continues to be pivotal, even in areas where calm currently prevails, many of which have an insufficient State presence. We note with concern that there has been very little progress in terms of disarmament and that distrust continues to prevail. One short-term goal is to enhance the people's perception of the level of security, because very often people hesitate to take a step forward in terms of disarmament for fear of losing their capacity for self-defence.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme initiated in February by MINUSTAH should be carried out without delay. That requires a clear-sighted and resolute attitude on the part of the Transitional Government as well as the disbursement of the required financial assistance by the donor community.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">Furthermore, as stated in the interim report Ad Hoc Advisory Group of the Economic and Social Council, to which the representative of Canada has just referred, in order to put an end to the violence, we have to tackle the underlying socio-economic conditions. The members of the Security Council and of the Ad Hoc Group noted in the field the weakness of Haiti's institutions. Their fragility is very clear in the areas of law enforcement and administration.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa12">In that respect, reform of the judicial and penal system, as well as training in the area of human rights for administrative bodies and security forces, is indispensable. Any development activity in Haiti has to be based on rebuilding the State and making it more answerable to the people, with particular attention paid to the inland areas.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa13">Regrettably, today the people's frustration is palpable at the scant international assistance that has been provided. We must therefore all work together to remedy that situation, including through the implementation of quick-impact projects in priority areas.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa14">Environmental sustainability and capacity-building in the area of human resources, along with institutional development throughout the country, are the areas that most urgently require the use of shock tactics.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa15">What is required is a continued effort by the international community. The peacebuilding Mission undertaken by the United Nations last year, by its very nature and scope, has to be a long-term operation. We therefore believe that it would be logical to extend MINUSTAH's mandate for a 12-month period.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa16">Spain, in keeping with its position within the European Union and its participation in the Ad Hoc Advisory Group of the Economic and Social Council Group and in MINUSTAH, will continue its efforts to promote peace and development in Haiti. In order to achieve those goals, it is indispensable, we believe, that the Core Group referred to in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1542(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1542 (2004)</a> fully carry out its mandate and receive support from all institutions concerned with Haiti's progress.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa17">We are convinced that, with the Council's support, decisive actions can be taken in the coming weeks. Spain will contribute to this undertaking to the fullest extent of its capabilities.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the Permanent Observer for the International Organization of la Francophonie to the United Nations, Mr. Ridha Bouabid, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bouabid</span> <span class="non-nation">International Organization of la Francophonie</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I should like to congratulate you, Madam President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May and to thank you, on behalf of the International Organization of la Francophonie, for having convened this debate on the report of the Council's mission to Haiti, which was a founding member of la Francophonie and which is close to our hearts.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">Today's meeting is an important one for more than one reason. It is being held in the wake of the recent Security Council mission to Haiti, led by the Ambassador of Brazil. It is an opportunity to discuss the conclusions and recommendations of the mission and to identify the adjustments that will be necessary to make to the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) when the time comes to renew it at the end of the month.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">This is an especially crucial time, because we are just a few months away from the important date of the elections, whose conduct and credibility will be considered by all as one of the main pillars of the long-term stability of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">La Francophonie is committed to seeing Haiti break the cycle of confrontation and violence and usher in an era of peace and prosperity. Haitians must make the necessary effort to embark once again on the path of peace, democracy, the rule of law and sustainable development. They must be able to rely on increased support from the international community and on increased humanitarian and material resources, so as to give the best possible chance to the transition and to establish the basis for a future which will be a better one in the long term.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">It is that message of encouragement, hope and solidarity from the Francophone community that President Abdou Diouf, Secretary-General of La Francophonie, delivered to the authorities and the people of Haiti on 20 March last -- the date of the commemoration of the International Day of la Francophonie. We see in the Security Council mission to Haiti a few days later the first mission ever dispatched to that part of the world -- a reflection of the common objectives that the Council and our organization are seeking to promote in Haiti. But to ensure that those goals are achieved, we believe that special attention should be given to the following three questions.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">First, in terms of security, we cannot hope for an electoral process to be conducted normally in a tense security situation. That is why we support the request of the Interim Prime Minister of Haiti to beef up security forces during the electoral period, particularly in the region of Port-au-Prince, where the problem seems to be particularly acute. We also support his request to deploy more French-speaking civilian police in MINUSTAH, since it appears that a French-speaking presence would make the police operations more effective.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">We hope that the mission dispatched by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to assess security needs will make positive recommendations in that respect, and in particular we hope that the Council will act on those recommendations and authorize a significant increase in civilian police personnel, so that the good work done by MINUSTAH over the past few months might be further enhanced and that security conditions could be effectively improved.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">Were the Security Council to adopt that measure, la Francophonie could help to mobilize its member States to provide additional French-speaking civilian police officers, as it did last year, when MINUSTAH was established. The Secretary-General of la Francophonie is in contact with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on this subject. I would recall in passing that of the roughly 30 countries that are now providing civilian police contingents to MINUSTAH, almost half are members of the International Organization of la Francophonie.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">The second issue is compliance with the electoral timetable and the need to make every effort to ensure that the elections are truly free, fair and transparent. The international community has a crucial role to play in that respect, in particular by providing technical assistance and financial support. For our part, we shall continue to contribute to that effort by providing necessary expertise to the Electoral Council until the elections are held.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">Finally, we believe it is crucial that we all fulfil the commitments we made at the July 2004 donors conference in Washington, which endorsed the Interim Cooperation Framework. The International Organization of la Francophonie intends to keep its part of the bargain. In addition to the assistance to the Electoral Council that I have just mentioned, we intend to follow up concretely on the two missions that we dispatched to the country in recent months. The first focused on the media, given its crucial role, particularly in the electoral period. The second mission focused on the key sector of support for justice and judicial system reform; it will be followed up through a programme to be implemented with quadripartite cooperation among the Haitian Ministry of Justice, the Canadian International Development Agency, the European Union and the International Organization of la Francophonie. The programme seeks to strengthen the fight against impunity, promote the independence of the judiciary and promote a better administration of justice through, inter alia, the training of judiciary personnel and the development of legal information.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">In conclusion, I would like to echo those delegations that recalled the importance of an inclusive national dialogue for the long-term reconciliation process, those that stressed the crucial need urgently to implement a comprehensive disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme and those delegations that stressed the importance of tackling the underlying cause of Haiti's instability: poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa12">The challenges are considerable. It is a difficult job, and the stakes are high. Thus, my organization supports the Security Council's oft-reaffirmed position in favour of a long-term United Nations presence in Haiti.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mérorès</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">Allow me first, Madam, to convey my delegation's congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the current month. Allow me also to convey my delegation's congratulations to Ambassador Wang Guangya of China, under whose presidency the Security Council mission, and that of the Economic and Social Council, were conducted.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">Once again, the commitment to assist Haiti in its process of democratic transition has been most eloquently demonstrated. The Security Council's mission from 13 to 16 April -- the first Council mission to Haiti or to Latin America -- in conjunction with the mission of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council, attests to the United Nations family's great interest in the cause of Haiti. I am pleased once again to welcome that initiative. On behalf of the people and the Government of Haiti, I thank the members of the Council, in particular the head of the mission, the Ambassador of Brazil, and convey the interest and the hope created among our people with respect to the awaited outcome of the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">I take this opportunity once again to thank the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for the very difficult work it is doing in my country. The Mission's presence is essential, and its role is particularly important in terms of creating security and in implementing a variety of development projects, which are most appreciated by my people.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">I humbly salute the memory of the members of the Mission who have died in carrying out their duties. They have the gratitude of the people of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">As the Council noted during its mission to Haiti and as expressed in its report, poverty and unemployment are at the root of the serious crisis confronting the country. The Interim Government's priority remains the holding of free and democratic elections at the end of 2005. However, in addition to the elections, my Government intends to lay the foundations for the socio-economic development of a modern State, a task that requires the long-term assistance of the United Nations and the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">That is why the Interim Government endorses the recommendations of the report, which notes that Haiti is at a decisive turning point in its history. The report states that the United Nations can help Haitians achieve their goals of stability and peace, and lay the foundations for sustainable social and economic development in full respect for the sovereignty of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">In that context, I am pleased to announce a set of measures that my Government will take in the framework of the elections and the efforts already agreed to create a stable environment conducive to the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">In fact, since April, the Haitian National Police, in conjunction with MINUSTAH, has been successfully carrying out a series of operations to gain control of some leaders of armed and dangerous gangs that sought to defy the State's authority. On 7 May, the police dismantled gangs that organized the kidnapping of persons in the metropolitan area and released hostages. To combat that phenomenon, the Haitian National Police and MINUSTAH have just created a coordinated cell to combat kidnapping, and the Government reaffirms its commitment to combat all forms of insecurity.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">Simultaneously, the Government of Haiti is working to restore the State's authority throughout its territory, regaining control of police stations that previously had been illegally occupied by groups claiming to be demobilized soldiers.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">Also in the framework of preparations for the elections, it is encouraging to note that electoral registration has begun, advancing the electoral process to the next stage, following the announcement of elections, their timetable and the previously established plan for operational activities and the consultations held between the Government, on the one hand, and the Provisional Electoral Council, the Organization of American States and MINUSTAH, on the other.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa11">Similarly, mindful that national reconciliation and dialogue are essential for the long-term political process, the head of State has officially initiated a national dialogue, which we deem to be a key element of the political transition. According to the wishes of the provisional President of the Republic, this will be an open dialogue, excluding no one, addressed to all political forces and all civil society groups that have renounced violence.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa12">The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme should be mentioned in that context. The Government is firmly convinced that the programme is absolutely crucial for attaining the goals it has set, and its commitment to achieving them cannot be doubted. However, the Government is aware of the fragility of that issue and intends to manage it the most rational way.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa13">An official commission was created to implement the DDR programme. However, the funds required to carry it out exceed available government funding, and pledged contributions for those activities remain limited. Making a reality of pledges made in Washington and Cayenne is essential for making progress on that programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa14">The Interim Government wishes to reaffirm its commitment to working for the respect of human rights, mindful that the three pillars of development, security and human rights are crucial for sustainable development. The Government thus endorses the recommendations of the Secretary-General contained in his report in <a href="../pdf/A-59-2005.pdf" class="pdf">document A/59/2005</a>, entitled "In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all".</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa15">However, the Government remains alive to comments and criticism from human rights organizations and is aware of certain deficiencies in the judiciary and in the police. It is working with the international community to rebuild and strengthen State institutions. The Government is not evading the necessary reforms of the police and the judiciary; it intends to do everything it can to carry them out. I would point out the placatory policy of the Government, which in recent months has taken steps to reach out to certain dignitaries of political parties.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa16">The Government once again reiterates its desire to combat all violations of human rights and intends to adopt all necessary measures to end impunity. It is resolutely committed to guarantee the security and safety of the people, to dismantle armed gangs and reintegrate them into civilian life, to reorganize the National Police, to adopt urgent measures to combat impunity in all its forms, and to embark on judicial reform, mindful of the promotion of and respect for the rights of all of citizens.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa17">We regret the words of some who call into question our determination to complete this exercise, which will guarantee compliance with the rights of all citizens. Particularly with regard to the situation of Mr. Neptune, the Council will recall, I am sure, the explanations that were given by the President of the Republic himself -- which were very clear -- in the Palais National during the audience that he accorded to members of the Council and to members of the Economic and Social Council delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa18">With regard to the Security Council mission, I wish to reaffirm here that the Interim Government resolutely intends to organize the elections by the end of the year and definitely will hand power over to the elected President. In order to do this and to lay the foundations for the development of the country, the ongoing assistance of the international community and of MINUSTAH will remain essential. Accordingly, we hope that MINUSTAH's mandate will be renewed in due course for not less than one year, pursuant to the recommendation of the Security Council mission and previous speakers.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa19">I would like to refer to the Economic and Social Council and once again to thank it for its involvement in the long-term development process in Haiti. The mission of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group that visited the country last month, in parallel to the Security Council mission, was eloquent testimony of its great interest in the economic future of my country. I would like, on behalf of the Government and people of Haiti, to thank the members of the Group -- in particular its leader, the Ambassador of Canada -- for the very outstanding work done in so little time and for the clear interest that they all expressed in the cause of the development of Haiti. They saw at first hand the enormous challenges confronting both the Interim Government and the Government that will emerge from the forthcoming elections, and above all the very close links between peace and development. They also saw the enormous interest their mission aroused in a people that is seeking a better future and the commitment of the authorities of the Interim Government to work to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa20">The finding of the mission that Haiti is far from attaining the Millennium Development Goals without major long-term assistance from the United Nations system and the international community merits the attention of all of us. The serious deficiencies in areas such as education, infrastructure, energy, roads, agriculture and the environment, and the weakness of the administrative capacity -- these are well-known to the Interim Government, and it is precisely in order to deal with them that the Government appealed to the Economic and Social Council to assist it and future Haitian Government in the ongoing and the necessary future efforts to that end. This is definitely an enormous and daunting challenge, but it is not an impossible challenge.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa21">On the strength of the clear determination of our people to overcome the trials arising from the vicissitudes of our history, and on the strength of the unconditional support of the United Nations and the international community -- and once again the Haitian Government renews its gratitude for the help received -- Haiti remains convinced that it will emerge tempered by this crisis and that it will regain the place rightfully assigned to it by destiny.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">Let me first take this opportunity, Madam President, to join those who have extended their congratulations to you and to the delegation of Denmark for your presidency this month, which is already showing itself to be successful. I also wish to thank Ambassador Wang Guangya and our Chinese colleagues for their excellent work in the presidency last month.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">I think this has been a valuable debate, with substantive contributions and assessments by Council members and other Members of the Organization. A remarkable coincidence can be seen in the statements this morning. As a result of our debate and of the work and recommendations of the mission, the Council will be in a position to consider, in an appropriate manner, the issues relating to Haiti, including the extension of MINUSTAH's mandate at the end of this month.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">I wish to make a comment in response to a concern expressed by Ambassador Sealy of Trinidad and Tobago, speaking for the CARICOM countries. I refer to the case of Mr. Yvon Neptune, a case that is mentioned in paragraph 44 of our report. In Haiti, long detentions while pending cases are awaiting trial, are, unfortunately, the rule and not the exception. Notwithstanding that circumstance, the status of high-level authorities of the former Government should be taken into account in order, inter alia, to enhance national reconciliation while preparations for elections are under way. Therefore the mission, in its contacts with the authorities and the press while in Haiti, stressed the need to speed up such cases.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">Finally, I wish to wholeheartedly thank our colleagues for their contributions to the work of the mission and also for their words addressed to our delegation, Brazil, and to myself personally. I also thank the Secretariat for the very able support the personnel gave our mission.</p>
