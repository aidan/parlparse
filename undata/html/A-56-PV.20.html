<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Sharma" nation="Nepal" language="">
	Mr. Sharma (Nepal)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I should like to thank you very much, Mr. President, for organizing this timely debate on measures to eliminate international terrorism, on the heels of the gravest terrorist attack in human history. I take this opportunity to express our deep sympathy and condolences to the Government and people of the United States, as well as to the bereaved families, for the tragedy that befell them on 11 September 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">The terrorists aimed at America, but they assaulted our common humanity and challenged the very values and principles the United Nations and its Member States stand to defend. Nearly 6,000 people -- children, young and old, men and women -- from America and some 80 other countries died or are missing under the rubble. Furthermore, 40,000 children will die before the age of five as an economic downturn hits the developing world as a result of the strike.</div>
	<div class="p">The economic cost of the horror is equally stupendous and widespread. While the already weakening United States economy sustained a staggering $40 billion loss, thousands of people witnessed their investments, employment and dreams go up in smoke. And the tidal wave of the destruction is likely to condemn 10 million people to poverty in developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p">We all know that terrorism destabilizes our States, destroys our economies and causes our societies to decay. Before that fateful day of 11 September, however, we could not imagine the extent to which the extremists were likely to go in their evil acts. Next time it could be worse, with the use of weapons of mass destruction -- biological, chemical or even nuclear.</div>
	<div class="p">Rather than intimidating the civilized world with their fanaticism, the terrorists have strengthened our resolve to defend our values and way of life. They have brought countries and peoples together in a broad coalition, united across race, region and religion. General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1">resolution 56/1</a> and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) embody our resolve. We now must act on them.</div>
	<div class="p">Nepal has firsthand experience of violence -- that unleashed by the so-called Maoist insurgency, which seeks to destroy democracy and freedom and to establish a totalitarian republic. The six-year violence has claimed more than 1,800 lives, disrupted our development process and destabilized our society.</div>
	<div class="p">Nepal strongly condemns terrorism in all its manifestations, and is committed to acting against it. We believe that each State has the right to defend itself against terrorist threats and to bring the perpetrators to justice. Nepal pledges its full cooperation to the United States Government in its campaign against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">A war against terror must be wider, deeper and stronger. It will not be easy or short. We will have to wage it on diplomatic, economic, political and military fronts to isolate terrorists, thwart their plots and eliminate their threats. We must starve them of their funds and track their communication links; we should frustrate cooperation among various terrorist groups, drug traffickers and other organized criminals -- cooperation which the terrorists use to raise finances, gain information, acquire weapons and execute their deadly designs. We should deny them shelter and sanctuary, deprive them of rest and refuge and ostracize their sponsors. We must take decisive action in the short run and be prepared for a long haul.</div>
	<div class="p">It would be folly to be captive to the impulse for revenge and retreat. Unless we fight to the finish, more virulent seeds of extremism will be sown in days ahead.</div>
	<div class="p">The method and manner in which States are pursuing cooperation to build a broad alliance, to investigate the suspected terrorist network for evidence and to cut their financial umbilical cord has encouraged Nepal. We hope that the cardinal principles of justice and fairness, the values that terrorists despise and civilized societies cherish, will be observed when action is taken, since these values set democratic societies apart from clandestine criminal networks.</div>
	<div class="p">The crime of a handful of culprits does not constitute the culpability of an entire community or culture. As casualties among innocent people are likely to tear down the coalition and generate a disastrous backlash, military targets should be selected carefully, and action should be surgical and precise. We need to debunk the terrorists' mystique and unmask their outrageous propaganda in order to expose their preposterous claims of crusade or cause.</div>
	<div class="p">The war on terror will have to be waged with equal vigour on the development and peace fronts as well. It will not be won until we remove dehumanizing poverty, ignorance and exclusion, and resolve conflicts that leave youth in despair and offer terrorists a pool of willing young recruits and supporters. We will have to create stakes for everyone in the existing global order and within its rules.</div>
	<div class="p">Victory will be impossible without committed and willing international cooperation. Countries that have the will but not the wealth to carry out the fight against this menace should receive cooperation and support from those who can afford it. And the United Nations can and should be pivotal in gathering and galvanizing global cooperation against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">In fact, the world body already has a dozen instruments to fight international terrorism. In addition, there are seven regional conventions, including one in South Asia. We must invoke and implement them, accede to them if we have not done so and strengthen them if necessary. And we must conclude a comprehensive and cogent convention against terrorism. When we agree on a broad picture, details should not prevent progress.</div>
	<div class="p">The slaughter of 11 September made an unequivocal statement: no one is immune from terrorist threats, and they can be horrendous beyond imagination. It has also reinforced the notion of the world's being a global village, where the fire of discontent in one corner can spread through the entire village. We must therefore work in partnership both to defeat terrorism and to prevent it from ever again raising its ugly head, by removing deprivation, discrimination and deadly disputes where terrorism thrives.</div>
	<div class="p">This is a challenge that will put to the test our will to act together out of enlightened self-interest, our willingness to reorder our priorities and our commitment to unity. It is a daunting task, but it will be equally rewarding for all of us.</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="2-10">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Orellana" nation="Honduras" language="Spanish">
	Mr. Orellana (Honduras)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Honduras is proud to be the coordinator of the Central American Integration System (SICA), and it is in this capacity that I appear before the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me, Mr. President, to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of this fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to offer you the support of my Mission in your delicate task.</div>
	<div class="p">The world witnessed with horror the terrorist attack of 11 September, and now no one doubts that everyone is within the reach of such a criminal action. In the list of victims we find, along with United States citizens, a great many people from Central America, as well as nationals of other countries -- people whose fervent dream it was to be part of the American dream, who were generously welcomed by this great nation.</div>
	<div class="p">To the families of those who perished in this inhuman attack, our condolences and sympathy. To the Government of the United States, to the authorities of the city and State of New York, and to the people of New York, we extend our brotherly and sincere support at this difficult time and our recognition of their extraordinary crisis management organization.</div>
	<div class="p">But the attack is also aimed at our most cherished values, those that sustain the system of life in modern society. That is why this has a worldwide dimension. But our common enemy is terrorism. Therefore, the decisions to be adopted must be precise and congruent -- that is, they must be specifically targeted against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The Central American countries, aware of the magnitude of these inhuman actions, acted immediately in response to the tragedy. The President pro tempore of SICA, President Carlos Roberto Flores of the Republic of Honduras, invited the Presidents of the other Central American republics to a summit meeting in El Zamorano, Honduras, where the Declaration entitled "Central America united against terrorism" was adopted. This document was presented as a letter to the Secretary-General on 20 September and published under the symbol <a href="../pdf/A-56-392">A/56/392</a>. Certainly, by now it has been circulated to the Assembly. The document firmly condemns acts of terrorism, no matter what their form, and considers them crimes against humanity and a threat to international peace and security. That is why the Declaration states that Central America endorses the Security Council resolution adopted on 12 September.</div>
	<div class="p">Among other measures, the Presidents of the countries of Central America decided the following: first, to improve and streamline the mechanisms for exchange of information concerning possible terrorist actions, among themselves and with the United States and other regional and multilateral bodies. Secondly, they decided to reinforce security along the borders and at the ports and airports of the region, as well as to step up control of migratory movements to prevent any movement of persons linked to terrorism. Thirdly, they decided to coordinate actions so that Central American territory will not be used by terrorist groups of any origin or ideology. Fourthly, they decided to promote the implementation of the necessary standards so that these crimes against humanity will be judged and punished as such by establishing adequate mechanisms to expedite extradition and to deliver these criminals to the States that so request; and fifthly, they decided to ensure the full entry into force of the relevant regional and international instruments.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, sectoral meetings have already been held to coordinate follow-up to this political declaration, such as the recently held meeting of the Central American Security Commission.</div>
	<div class="p">Central America's response has been quick and forceful. We will spare no effort to join in solidarity with the decisions adopted by this world forum and to participate in the actions to be undertaken, because support for the international community in its fight against terrorism must be unanimous and unlimited.</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="3-7">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Nteturuye" nation="Burundi" language="French">
	Mr. Nteturuye (Burundi)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The pictures of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on the fateful morning of 11 September 2001 shocked the entire human community. Barbarism and infamy found their best expression in the terrorist attacks of that day, to such an extent that television viewers around the world asked themselves if what they were watching on the screen was reality or fiction. The diabolical forces had indeed just hit New York, a world capital, a capital of all civilization, our beloved city.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly debate on international terrorism gives me the opportunity to join my own voice to that of the President of Burundi, speaking on behalf of the Government and the people of Burundi, and to the voices of the Mayor of the city of Bujumbura, of Rudolph Giuliani and of the Mayor of the city of Washington, D.C., to offer my sincere condolences to the American people and to the families of the victims of the tragedy of 11 September 2001. All the Burundi people join the American people and all the peoples of the world in mourning the victims of the tragedy and in attempting to understand the reason for such human madness.</div>
	<div class="p">The terrorist attacks of 11 September act against peace and international security. The Mayor of the city of New York emphasized that; the Secretary-General did also.</div>
	<div class="p">Hence the relevance of this joint reflection within our world Organization, whose primary mission is, according to the Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter, to "save succeeding generations from the scourge of war" and to "maintain international peace and security" by taking "effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of peace".</div>
	<div class="p">Prevent and suppress: this is what the international community must do, not only rhetorically or abstractly, but also concretely, daily, without evasion or ambiguity. The United Nations provides a privileged forum for action and coordination.</div>
	<div class="p">The world must be convinced that it is one, that the people who compose it are linked by a common destiny, share the same aspirations and must be comforted by the same hopes. That is why Burundi welcomes the speed and the enthusiasm with which the countries of the world have formed a united front against terrorism, a new scourge that has joined the scourges of poverty and disease.</div>
	<div class="p">The authors of the actions of 11 September must answer for their acts before justice, and their networks must be dismantled. The American Government has the right to punish the guilty, and it has Burundi's support, provided that the enemy is well targeted and the operation does not cause the death of innocent civilians.</div>
	<div class="p">The Security Council and the General Assembly condemned the terrorist attack that very day. Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is a real blueprint for the immediate combat of terrorism. International cooperation is called upon to function fully and immediately.</div>
	<div class="p">But that will not be sufficient if all countries do not understand terrorism in the same way and if deep reflection is not initiated to try to crack the shell of this new evil of modern times, in order to better eradicate it.</div>
	<div class="p">Various delegations have expressed the wish that this debate would not dwell indefinitely on the definition of terrorism and that this task would be left to experts in international humanitarian law. While we understand this stance in view of the urgency of the situation and the criminal shock of 11 September, my delegation believes that the world coalition against terrorism will not be truly effective unless all the actors identify the cause of evil and attack its roots, instead of beginning by treating the symptoms.</div>
	<div class="p">Indeed, terrorism was not born on 11 September. It has existed for a long time, and it kills thousands of innocent people throughout the world every day. It often seems that what is considered a terrorist act by some is tolerated or is even seen by others as "liberating violence". This situation is very dangerous for the struggle that we must carry out together.</div>
	<div class="p">In its paragraph 2, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-158">resolution 55/158</a>, adopted by the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly on 30 January 2001</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"<i>Reiterates</i> that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them."</div>
	<div class="p">The Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, adopted in Algeria on 14 July 1999, defines in its first article a terrorist act as any act or threat of act that can endanger life, physical integrity, the freedom of a person or of a group of persons, and is committed with the intention of intimidating, provoking a situation of terror; forcing, pressuring or leading Governments, agencies, institutions, populations or groups of populations to undertake any initiative, or to abstain from adopting or giving up a given policy, or to adopt or renounce any particular position, or to follow certain principles; or is intended to disturb the normal functioning of public services, the provision of essential services to populations and to create a crisis situation among populations; or is intended to create a general insurrection within a given State party.</div>
	<div class="p">In its third article, the same Convention specifies that struggles waged by peoples in accordance with the principles of international law for liberation or self-determination, including armed struggle against colonialism, occupation, aggression and domination by foreign forces, are not considered terrorist acts.</div>
	<div class="p">This approach is shared by the Ad Hoc Committee established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a> and the Working Group of the Sixth Committee, as a careful reading of the report (<a href="../pdf/A-56-37">A/56/37</a>) of the Ad Hoc Committee shows.</div>
	<div class="p">In his introductory statement to our debate, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, underscored that we need not only legal precision in the definition of terrorism, but also moral clarity. He said:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"There can be no acceptance of those who would seek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent civilian life, regardless of cause or grievance. ...</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Even in situations of armed conflict, the targeting of innocent civilians is illegal, as well as morally unacceptable." (<i><a href="../pdf/A-56-PV.12">A/56/PV.12</a></i>)</div>
	<div class="p">In other words, even war has rules that must be followed. That is why the hateful attacks against the innocent populations of New York, Washington and Pennsylvania are acts of terrorism that must be unreservedly condemned by the entire international community.</div>
	<div class="p">The people of Burundi feel all the more solidarity with the people of the United States in their pain, because for eight years it, too, has been victim to terrorism and acts of genocide committed by armed groups supported from abroad. The mobilization and enthusiasm following the attack of 11 September lead the people of Burundi to hope that the international community will finally understand that blind violence caused by armed groups for so-called political ends must be considered as terrorism and fought against as such within the framework of this world coalition.</div>
	<div class="p">For how can one justify a deadly attack against students in their dormitories by assailants that say they are defending democracy? How are we to describe the gradual decimation by disease, hunger and hopelessness of hundreds of unfortunate, rejected women, children and old people, survivors of the tragedy of 1993, who are confined in camps for displaced persons? How are we to describe fanatics who dismember babies and tear open pregnant women while singing "Alleluia" and reciting verses from the Bible? How can we tolerate irrational fatal attacks against buses full of passengers -- nationals as well as foreigners? What are we to say about attacks against international airlines that serve our national capital? Why is the international community procrastinating when thousands of assailants, in coalition with genocidal Rwandan fighters, as the report annexed to document S/1998/777 attests, infiltrate into Burundi and commit their criminal, genocidal acts, gladly boasting of them in the media of countries that have seen the birth of modern civilization and where the criminals have received asylum?</div>
	<div class="p">Let us not delude ourselves. War and violence, unfortunately, will not soon cease in our world, despite the collective realization of the danger of terrorism. One of the weaknesses of international action is hypocrisy, double standards dictated by contradictory interests.</div>
	<div class="p">In Burundi, all the violence which I have just described has not kept the Burundi people from sitting down at the negotiating table to attempt to define the evils that corrode their society and agree measures to ward them off. A well known sociological precept teaches us that man is born good, but society makes him bad. The dialogue continues, therefore, despite the opposition of those who believe that the authors of the daily crimes have since October 1993 committed genocide in Burundi.</div>
	<div class="p">The political accord that negotiators signed a year ago concluded that the conflict in Burundi is essentially political, with a very strong tribal overtone. There must, then, be a political solution, but at the same time, there must be a defence against the criminals who attack innocent civilian populations and have refused to join the camp of those that want peace, thereby showing their true face.</div>
	<div class="p">After all, the people of Burundi lived together in complete harmony before the inoculation of the divisive germ of colonialism, which developed into a genocidal ideology responsible for the holocaust in Burundi and Rwanda. Peaceful coexistence is still possible. The threat to universal values in this region of Africa is also a threat to peace and international security. That is why it is a universal duty to fight mercilessly against genocidal assailants and terrorists, wherever they may be from.</div>
	<div class="p">Everything must be clear for the world coalition, at the level of legal instruments for the struggle against terrorism and international crime and at the level of drug trafficking and the illegal arms trade. There must be the same firm commitment to fight poverty, misery, disease, ignorance and the other scourges that can explain fanaticism and hopelessness, especially among young people, without, however, justifying the resulting irrational violence.</div>
	<div class="p">Burundi is committed to signing, ratifying or adhering to all international conventions in the struggle against terrorism as soon as possible, and supports the convening of a high-level conference to define a joint response to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Burundi will also implement the relevant provisions of the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, as well as the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, to which it is already a party. Finally, Burundi will soon adapt its national laws to international conventions concerning the struggle against terrorism, being convinced that the time has come for the world to adopt precise measures against this danger for present and future generations.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation hopes that the work under way to arrive at a comprehensive convention against terrorism will be quickly concluded in order to complement the legal arsenal now available. The world must be firm and organized, with countries standing together, to carry out an effective struggle against international terrorism, the common enemy of us all.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="6-2">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Beyendeza" nation="Uganda" language="">
	Mr. Beyendeza (Uganda)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I congratulate you, Sir, and your country on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I also salute your initiative, supported by the General Assembly, to give priority to the consideration of measures to eliminate international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation fully aligns itself with the remarks made earlier by the Permanent Representatives of Tanzania and Kenya on joint regional efforts being made by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to deal with the problem of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">On Tuesday, 11 September 2001, the United States of America suffered the worst terrorist attack in history, as the terrorists struck targets in Washington, D.C., and New York, causing the tragic loss of thousands of innocent victims from the United States and over 80 other nations around the globe.</div>
	<div class="p">The President of Uganda, Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, the Government and the people of Uganda have already sent their heartfelt condolences and sympathy to President George Bush, the Government and the people of the United States of America. The barbaric action against innocent victims fills the people of Uganda with revulsion and indignation, and must not go unpunished. At this time of grief, our thoughts and prayers go to the victims, their relatives, friends and all those others who have been touched in one way or another by these tragic events.</div>
	<div class="p">No political, economic or religious reasons can justify the terrorists' use of indiscriminate violence against innocent people. Terrorism as a strategy is unacceptable, erroneous and ethically indefensible as a means of fighting even for a just cause. It is erroneous and indefensible because it targets people who may not be enemies. Indeed, many victims of the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September may have been sympathetic, neutral or simply indifferent to the very causes to which the terrorists wished to lay claim. It is unacceptable because such acts create terror in every society, endanger lives and undermine the well-being of individuals and families by disrupting economies, and pose a threat to international peace and security. Uganda therefore unequivocally condemns as criminal and unjustifiable all acts, methods and practices of terrorism, regardless of where they are committed or by whom.</div>
	<div class="p">For the last 15 years the people of Uganda have been facing terrorism carried out by the fundamentalist Lord's Resistance Army, in the northern parts of Uganda, and by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), in the southern parts of Uganda. Both the Lord's Resistance Army and the Allied Democratic Forces are groups that have hitherto been supported by the Sudan. The method of terror employed by the Lord's Resistance Army is to maim innocent children and women, cutting off body parts, and to kidnap survivors, taking them to their bases outside Uganda. The ADF's method has been characterised by the use of terrorist bombs placed in buses, taxis and busy shopping areas in Kampala and other towns in Uganda.</div>
	<div class="p">However, Uganda is particularly encouraged by the statement by the representative of the Sudan to the Assembly on 2 October that the Sudan will no longer allow its territory to be a haven for any terrorist groups or individuals, and that it is now ready to match words with deeds. We therefore expect that commitment to be followed by concrete steps to stop the Lord's Resistance Army and ADF terrorist attacks on Uganda.</div>
	<div class="p">Those terrorist attacks have had a very negative effect on our country and our economy. It is estimated, for example, that the Ugandan economy would have by far surpassed the current average gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.5 per cent had it not been for the sustained campaign of terrorism inflicted on the Ugandan people for one and a half decades.</div>
	<div class="blockquote"><i>Mr Balzan (Malta), Vice-President, took the Chair.</i></div>
	<div class="p">In his address to Parliament in Kampala two days after the incident in New York, our Minister of State for Foreign Affairs outlined Uganda's three-tier coordinated strategy at the national, regional and global levels in support of a strong international response to terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">At the national level, the laws of Uganda make it an offence for anyone to engage in, or carry out, acts of terrorism. Similarly, anyone who aids, finances, harbours or renders support in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism commits an offence. All these offences carry life imprisonment as a penalty. Uganda will also be taking urgent measures to implement the Security Council resolution against terrorism, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Ugandan Parliament has been urged to act quickly and resolutely to enact domestic measures to implement international conventions and plug the loopholes in existing laws to deal with sophisticated terrorist methods and their financing mechanisms, and to create an effective and sustained deterrence to terrorism in Uganda.</div>
	<div class="p">The 11 September events caused tragedy not only for the United States of America, but also for the other 85 nations whose citizens perished in the World Trade Center. In a broader sense, therefore, the terrorist attack on that day was an attack on the international community. The United Nations must take the necessary measures to eliminate terrorism as a threat to international peace and security. The United Nations must use its unique position to build a truly multilateral coalition that will create a legitimate global framework for a well coordinated and sustained fight against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community has already concluded 12 international conventions designed to strengthen the legal framework for international cooperation in combating terrorism. Uganda has already signed and ratified the aviation conventions and protocols against terrorism and, as a matter of priority, Uganda is determined to work with the rest of the international community to become a party to the rest of the conventions.</div>
	<div class="p">Uganda calls upon the international community to carefully adopt strategies to fight terrorism through effective implementation of United Nations anti-terrorism conventions, and welcomes Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> as a new and concrete measure to counter the new challenges from the ever-changing face of terrorism guided by criminal individuals, organizations and States.</div>
	<div class="p">Uganda further calls on the United Nations to: move rapidly to strengthen and finalize the draft convention on the suppression of nuclear terrorism and a comprehensive convention on international terrorism; declare terrorism a crime against humanity and establish an international mechanism to punish those responsible for carrying out or assisting terrorist activities; and mobilize the necessary global resources to enable the developing countries, and especially the least developed countries, to design and build national and regional mechanisms and capacities to implement United Nations conventions and resolutions against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">As we confront the scourge of terrorism, the United Nations must continue to address conditions that give rise to hatred, depravity, extremism and fundamentalism. Indeed, the United Nations should seek to achieve the millennium targets, including addressing, among other things, the causes of conflict, ignorance, disease and poverty.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that terrorism is a crime against humanity. Terrorism is morally and ethically indefensible. Under no circumstances must we seek to justify the killing of innocent people for any political cause. Terrorism is an international problem that requires a coordinated, multisectoral and multidimensional response at the national, regional and global levels. Let us make it clear that the Members of the United Nations have the courage, the technology and the political will to take collective, appropriate, prompt and adequate measures in response to the scourge of terrorism. Let us send a strong message to the terrorists, their supporters and their sympathizers that the United Nations can and will act decisively against terrorism.</div>

	Mr. Vohidov (Uzbekistan)

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The people of the Republic of Uzbekistan grieves with the people of the United States in the aftermath of the inhuman acts of terror perpetrated on 11 September in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. In a letter addressed to the President of the United States, George W. Bush, the President of Uzbekistan, Islam A. Karimov, condemned those barbaric acts and stressed the importance of international efforts to combat the terrible scourge of terrorism and his willingness to join in such efforts.</div>
	<div class="p">This unprecedented act of terrorist aggression poses a cruel challenge to all mankind. The number of victims is unprecedented: more than 6,000 people from 60 countries died, including people from Uzbekistan. Unfortunately, Uzbekistan knows from bitter experience how horrendous terrorism is. The explosions that echoed on 16 February 1999 in our capital of Tashkent -- carried out by the same forces responsible for the events of 11 September -- shed particularly stark light on the important need to enable our State to combat this threat. The Government and the Parliament are carrying out needed reform, including legislative reform, to help provide security for our people, our society and our State, to protect our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to maintain law and order and national concord.</div>
	<div class="p">International terrorism, extremism, aggressive nationalism and separatism are dangerous detonators of bombshells against international peace, security and stability. We are witnessing a strengthening of the horrendous link between international terrorism and transnational organized crime, the trade in drugs and weapons, and money-laundering.</div>
	<div class="p">The defiant actions of international terrorist organizations suggest that they may possess and be willing to use nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The consequences of terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction are unimaginable.</div>
	<div class="p">In last year's Millennium Declaration, heads of State or Government expressed their determination to take coordinated action to combat international terrorism. There has been significant progress in formulating international legal instruments to combat international terrorism. Uzbekistan is a full party to all 12 current international anti-terrorism conventions and protocols. But in the light of the current growing threat and challenge posed by international terrorism, it is becoming vital for the General Assembly to work speedily towards the adoption of the two international instruments now under discussion: a comprehensive convention to combat international terrorism, and a draft convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Today, the facts show that to fight terrorism it is not enough merely to formulate and adopt international instruments. We believe that to achieve effective results in the fight against terrorism we must set up a global system of cooperation within the United Nations. Here, one fact stands out: items on combating international terrorism are now on the agenda of the Security Council. There is no doubt that Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> was an important milestone on the road to such a global system; it proposed the establishment of an international mechanism to monitor implementation by all States of United Nations anti-terrorism decisions. We support that Security Council resolution and hope that the resulting mechanism will be effective.</div>
	<div class="p">But we are certain that we must supplement that by enhancing the capacity of the United Nations to combat international terrorism, by strengthening and developing existing structures within the United Nations system. Here, we believe that the Security Council should be actively supported by a specialized United Nations body that would provide information and analytical and technical support for the implementation of Council anti-terrorism resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p">At the fifty-third session of the General Assembly, in 1998, we proposed the establishment within the United Nations system of a committee for the prevention of terrorist activities and for combating international terrorism. That idea has been further developed in the light of the urgent need for the international community to step up its campaign against the growing threat of international terrorism. Twice -- at the Istanbul summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and at the Millennium Summit -- the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Islam A. Karimov, offered an initiative to establish an international centre to combat terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">In its statement of 13 September 2001, following the events of 11 September, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan submitted to the Secretary-General a proposal to take effective, urgent measures to create such a centre. The need to do so was noted also in the Final Document of the International Conference of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, entitled "Enhancing Security and Stability in Central Asia: An Integrated Approach to Counter Drugs, Organized Crime and Terrorism", which took place in Tashkent on 19 to 20 October 2000. A large group of States expressed their support for that initiative. However, it has not yet been practically implemented.</div>
	<div class="p">The main task of the proposed centre would be to provide technical and consultative services to States and to international and regional organizations on the implementation of the provisions of international instruments and decisions of the United Nations in combating both the phenomenon of international terrorism and the forces that support, finance, facilitate and organize it.</div>
	<div class="p">We see this centre as an international structure, under the auspices of the United Nations, that would compile and disseminate among States Members of the Organization and other interested States, as well as other international and regional organizations, information and analytical material on actions taken in the area of international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to the report of the Secretary-General dated 26 July 2000, entitled "Measures to eliminate international terrorism", in which concern is expressed about a lack of human and financial resources in the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention in Vienna. This definitely makes it more difficult, to put it mildly, to implement its mandate.</div>
	<div class="p">Given the desire to find a more rational and expeditious way to step up cooperation and coordination within the United Nations system in the task of preventing terrorism, we believe that it would be a good idea to transform the Terrorism Prevention Branch into an international centre to combat terrorism, as part of the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, similar to the existing Centre for Crime Prevention.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to note that this proposal to strengthen and enhance the status of the existing anti-terrorist structure within the Secretariat has been supported in the statements made by a number of States during this plenary meeting of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">We are convinced that only by pooling our efforts can we successfully combat international terrorism. This will require the elaboration of coordinated global measures and possibly a global plan of action. In this context, we support the initiative of the Secretary-General to convene at an early date a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations to devise a plan for joint organized action by the international community to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are convinced that such a conference would facilitate the constructive consideration and adoption of urgent strategies and measures to eliminate international terrorism.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="9-7">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Aliyev" nation="Azerbaijan" language="">
	Mr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The Republic of Azerbaijan strongly condemns the heinous crimes committed against innocent civilians on 11 September. These terrorist acts represent a direct challenge not only to the people of the United States but to the entire civilized world, and they constitute barbaric assaults on human decency, freedom and democracy.</div>
	<div class="p">Azerbaijan, together with other nations throughout the world, mourns the victims of these attacks and expresses its solidarity with the people of the United States.</div>
	<div class="p">In his statement of 12 September 2001, President Heydar Aliyev stressed:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The horrible acts of terror that were committed in New York and Washington deeply shocked and saddened the Azerbaijani people. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, which humankind entered with high expectations, terrorism has emerged, in an unprecedented manner, as a global crime that recognizes no borders and is contrary to all human values. While the United States is the target today, such a tragedy could potentially befall all nations and peoples. The people of Azerbaijan, who have themselves experienced the terrifying and painful consequences of terrorism, understand the suffering of the friendly American people and share in their immeasurable grief."</div>
	<div class="p">Azerbaijan has repeatedly and unequivocally condemned, in the strongest possible terms, international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, for whatever purpose and by whomever perpetrated.</div>
	<div class="p">In conducting joint actions and operations against terrorists, Member States should unite on the basis of principles rather than on the basis of their temporary or narrow national interests.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, Azerbaijan would like to underline the following principles.</div>
	<div class="p">First, Member States should unequivocally and unambiguously condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as well as any support or recognition of terrorism or failure to condemn it directly.</div>
	<div class="p">Second, terrorism is a transnational menace that threatens the lives of peoples and undermines the security, territorial integrity, unity and sovereignty of States.</div>
	<div class="p">Third, in the long run, and as an ultimate goal, the international community should not only fight against terrorist organizations and individuals, but also should do its utmost to eliminate the causes of terrorism, which are mostly of a political nature.</div>
	<div class="p">Fourth, nothing can justify terrorism and nothing can be used as a pretext to engage in it.</div>
	<div class="p">Fifth, the international community should fight against those who have chosen terror as a means to achieve their political goals.</div>
	<div class="p">Sixth, terrorism is adopted and widely practised by separatist regimes and illegal entities. Such groups, using areas under their control, are engaged in and profiting from illicit drug trafficking, the illicit arms trade, trafficking in human beings, money-laundering and other kinds of criminal and illegal economic activities. The money obtained is being used for the financing of terrorism. Therefore, there is a vital need for the international community to consolidate and direct its efforts to eliminate aggressive separatism and other forms of extremism.</div>
	<div class="p">Seventh, the fight against each and every terrorist organization, regardless of the scope of its activities, should be waged on a global scale. Purposeful activity must be carried out consistently on the part of the international community to flush out and combat terrorist organizations, groups and persons who have chosen terror as a tool for achieving their goal. To this end, the United Nations has to take the lead in elaborating a programme of action against international terrorism and in compiling a comprehensive list of terrorist organizations.</div>
	<div class="p">The phenomenon of terrorism has to be considered beyond its religious and cultural context. We all are well aware of the numerous acts of terrorism witnessed in many parts in the world which clearly prove this.</div>
	<div class="p">Eighth, as a primary task, there is an urgent need for consolidated efforts to prevent the training, assistance to and financing of terrorist organizations and groups in the territories of any given State, particularly giving terrorists refuge and protection.</div>
	<div class="p">Azerbaijan has maintained its firm position against international terrorism. By joining the global anti-terrorist coalition, my country reconfirmed its readiness to do its utmost and to contribute to the efforts of the international community to uproot this evil. In this regard, Azerbaijan fully supports General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1">resolution 56/1</a> and Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001). In their context, I am pleased to inform this body that today, here at United Nations Headquarters, Azerbaijan signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">I will now speak on behalf of the States of the Georgia Uzbekistan Ukraine Azerbaijan Moldova Group (GUUAM). From the very inception of the GUUAM, the proper addressing of terrorism has always been the top priority of this grouping. It is worth mentioning that combating international terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking is one of the main objectives of the GUUAM Charter, signed by the Presidents of those States at their summit, held in July 2001 in Yalta, Ukraine, and contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-992">A/55/992</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">In their joint statement regarding the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the GUUAM States unanimously stressed that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"a challenge was posed not only to the United States of America, but to the entire world community. The GUUAM States firmly condemn the actions of the terrorists and advocate that the forces which support terrorist acts should be subjected to the severe punishment which they deserve.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The events of 11 September demonstrated with merciless clarity the need to establish conditions in the system of international relations which would exclude the possibility of a repetition of such tragedies. The GUUAM States are prepared to participate actively in the consolidation of the efforts of the international community in the struggle against international terrorism." (<i><a href="../pdf/A-46-405">A/46/405</a></i>)</div>
	<div class="p">As the Secretary-General mentioned in his opening statement on 1 October,</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The task now is to build on that wave of human solidarity to ensure that the momentum is not lost and to develop a broad, comprehensive and above all sustained strategy to combat terrorism and eradicate it from our world." (<i><a href="../pdf/A-56-PV.12">A/56/PV.12</a></i>)</div>
	<div class="p">As an item for consideration, the GUUAM States would like to reiterate their view that there is a need for a proper international anti-terrorist institution with the primary task of complementing the individual efforts of States in combating international terrorism and of assisting them in implementing relevant legal instruments in the most efficient manner. We hope that the General Assembly will take up this issue in due time.</div>

	Mr. Alimov (Tajikistan)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Not a single disaster of any magnitude that has been wrought on this planet by the cataclysms of nature; not a single internal armed conflict of the kind that, every year, grinds hundreds of human lives and fates in its millstones; not a single one of the shocks that have occurred on the international financial markets in recent decades could have elicited such a powerful and united reaction from the world community as did the horrendous terrorist acts that took place on 11 September, leading to enormous loss of life, destruction and harm to New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania.</div>
	<div class="p">The unprecedented terrorist act of aggression suffered by the United States and the deaths of entirely innocent people from more than 60 countries could not fail to arouse the enraged indignation of all people of good will and the harshest condemnation of the instigators and organizers of this appalling act of violence against mankind.</div>
	<div class="p">The people of Tajikistan were acquainted in the recent past with all of the horrors of civil war and have often felt the cruel assaults of international terrorists. We learned of the tragedy of the American people with pain in our hearts.</div>
	<div class="p">President Emomali Rakhmonov, in conveying the sincere condolences of the Tajik people to President George Bush, all the victims and the bereaved families, expressed our complete solidarity with the people of the United States and our willingness to engage in close cooperation with the United States Government and other States in actions to combat and eradicate international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Tajikistan decisively condemns and rejects terrorism in all its manifestations. We believe that every terrorist act is completely unjustified; it is a cruel, ugly crime against mankind and a threat to international peace and security. Tajikistan will do its utmost to support efforts to undertake and carry through measures to hold the organizers and perpetrators of these terrible acts to account before the law, in accordance with the norms of international law.</div>
	<div class="p">Our Government has a deep understanding of the danger posed to the entire civilized world and to mankind by international terrorism. It is clear to all today that we can put an end to that phenomenon, which is alien to human civilization, and overcome this perfidious enemy and clandestine monster only if we pool our efforts.</div>
	<div class="p">The President of Tajikistan has repeatedly urged the community of nations from this very rostrum to pool its efforts in combating the world terrorism underground and to establish a global system to counter those who dream of turning back the clock, seek to intimidate mankind and want to stop our forward development. My country is a party to the Treaty on Cooperation among States Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Combating Terrorism and makes a significant contribution, within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, to the emerging regional structure to counter international terrorism. We are also participating actively in the international coalition now being formed to combat international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Tajikistan believes that a united response to the forces of evil must demonstrate the loyalty of the community of nations to the basic principles of multilateralism and humanitarian ethics. We must be consistent and sincere in our struggle against the terrorism international. Political hypocrisy and self-isolation will pander to the terrorists and lead to new catastrophes and human suffering.</div>
	<div class="p">In this context, the unconditional implementation of the measures provided for in Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is of key importance. We hope that the Committee established by the Security Council will become an effective and active mechanism for international monitoring of compliance by all States with United Nations decisions on combating terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Tajikistan commends the Security Council for taking a targeted and specific approach to the problem of international terrorism. It has laid out a principled position and programme of action in this extremely important area. It is no less important in this context that the General Assembly elaborate a common international legal platform to counter this challenge through the speedy adoption of a comprehensive convention to combat international terrorism, as well as a convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">While seeking answers to the question of the underlying causes of this terrible phenomenon of terrorism, we must continue to strengthen the basis of our anti-terrorist activities. The United Nations has universally recognized experience in coordinating the efforts of Member States in this area, and it must play a key role in setting up, under United Nations auspices, a global system to counter the large-scale threat posed by international terrorism. Of course, much time and effort will be required for that. But the lofty goal of completely eradicating this vicious phenomenon will, we hope, justify all of our expectations.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="12-2">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Wurth" nation="Luxembourg" language="French">
	Mr. Wurth (Luxembourg)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Speaking from this rostrum on 24 September, I expressed, on behalf of my Government and compatriots, the condolences and sympathy of the people of Luxembourg for the attacks that took place on 11 September. It is now up to this universal Organization to shoulder its responsibility for isolating and fighting against terrorism at the global level, as well as to undertake a huge information and education campaign. These crimes require a three-fold response: a common expression of rejection; greater awareness of our common heritage; and the definition of common security measures.</div>
	<div class="p">First, there is a need for rejection. The product of a nihilistic fanaticism, these murders represent a repudiation of the peoples of the world. There can be no indulgence for such acts; that would be unthinkable. The tragic events of 11 September have already changed our lives. Countless voices from the vast majority of countries, from both political leaders and ordinary citizens, have condemned terrorism and are calling for action to eliminate it. These voices have reaffirmed the unity of the values of humanity and civilization that we all share.</div>
	<div class="p">The barbarous acts that we witnessed are the result of blind adherence to a vision of the world inspired by hate and scorn. The authors of those acts have no respect for people. They twist the values of religion to deny the convergence of cultures and civilizations. Their inability to convince and to share with others -- a trait that is inherent to all those who commit acts of violence -- contrasts with the might of the values of cooperation and democracy, which draw their strength from tolerance, respect and freedom. That strength is intact; in fact, it is stronger than ever. The twin towers of the World Trade Center are no longer visible. But their image is stronger than ever. That image will come to embody for us the hope for a world that is fairer, more tolerant and more fraternal.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, the international community will arrive at a greater awareness of the ties that bind us together. The desire for justice, which is innate in us, will help to provide us with the insight we need if we are to identify the true challenges. The necessary security measures will be put in place, but the problems resulting from poverty -- problems faced by men and women, young and old, with which they will continue to struggle -- will be brought home to us in more concrete terms. The recent tragic events will surely lead to a sharper awareness of our commonality and a renewed resolution to reject that which divides us.</div>
	<div class="p">The States Members of the United Nations have heard the appeal of the Secretary-General: the struggle against the scourges of our times -- conflict, ignorance, poverty and disease -- will intensify. The world will show that it can prevail and create a society that is more just, charitable, authentic and resilient. This concerted response must find its expression in both international and national law. If the idea of a crime against humanity is to make any sense, it cannot ignore the events of 11 September. At the national level, the construction of stable States, based on democratic legitimacy and law, will provide a solid foundation for lasting development and for the struggle against terrorism and hatred. The lesson that we can now learn from those events is that large-scale terrorism is a phenomenon that transcends boundaries and therefore requires a global response.</div>
	<div class="p">The United States of America introduced proposals in this connection, and the Security Council adopted them. It is fortunate that the greatest Power places the defence of its interests within the framework of a common effort to which all countries of the world are party. The recent attacks have shown how vulnerable modern society is in the face of the determination of well-organized groups. Given the nature of the threat, which might strike anywhere and at any time, both the immediate and the long-term response must be collective. This universal Organization is the indispensable focal point for the construction of a partnership to combat this scourge, as well as for action to root out hatred. It is our duty to ensure that the common interest prevails over division. The United States of America can count on more than the passing solidarity of the other nations, and they can expect full cooperation in the construction of a more stable and safer world.</div>
	<div class="p">The necessary security measures will be undertaken. This universal Organization reacted promptly after 11 September. In the wake of the attacks, the Secretary-General spoke on our behalf with dignity and sobriety, and we are deeply grateful to him for that. The General Assembly and the Security Council adopted resolutions within 36 hours of the events and, speaking with one voice, called for international cooperation to bring to justice those who were responsible for or complicit in those terrorist acts. The Security Council adopted a further resolution, and we are now considering ways to strengthen international instruments so as to prevent such acts in the future.</div>
	<div class="p">During the course of many recent ministerial-level meetings, the European Union emphasized that the struggle against terrorism requires a response at all levels -- national, regional and international. On 21 September, the European Council, meeting at the level of heads of State or Government, reaffirmed the legitimacy of a response and the urgency of taking joint action. The solidarity of Europe with the United States, and its determination to cooperate within a broad international coalition, are assured. The Permanent Representative of Belgium, whose country will hold the rotating presidency of the European Union until the end of the year, also spoke on our behalf when, from this rostrum, he provided details about the measures decided upon in Europe.</div>
	<div class="p">Effective international legal cooperation will be an important component of the struggle against crime in general and against terrorist networks in particular. Luxembourg is fully involved in that effort.</div>
	<div class="p">Without mentioning terrorism as such, terrorist acts are considered and punished by the provisions of the Luxembourg penal code, including those on crimes against State security, on violations of legislation dealing with arms and munitions, on the taking of hostages and on voluntary and involuntary assault and battery. The penal code criminalizes the constitution of associations of criminals and criminal organizations, as well as participation in their activities. Financing of these criminal activities is considered an act of participation or complicity.</div>
	<div class="p">We must underscore that the authors and accomplices of terrorist or criminal acts can never be protected by banking confidentiality. In fact, the law expressly provides that confidentiality ceases in the penal area and in court. All professionals in the financial sector are legally obliged to cooperate fully with the authorities in charge of law enforcement, who, in turn, cooperate with their counterparts abroad. The law on money-laundering regulates cooperation on the part of the financial sector with the competent authorities. This legislation contains an obligation to verify the identity of actors and the origin of funds. It requires mandatory notification to the legal authorities of all facts that might indicate the existence of a crime in relation to funds. Crimes and offences committed within the framework of a criminal organization or an association of criminals constitute a major violation of the laws against money-laundering.</div>
	<div class="p">The legislation of Luxembourg also provides for very strict conditions for access to the financial sector, specifically as regards the identity and moral character of stockholders and executives of financial institutions.</div>
	<div class="p">Since the decision of the United States President on 24 September to freeze the assets of a certain number of persons and organizations suspected of having links to terrorism, the authorities of Luxembourg have forbidden banks and professionals in the financial sector from undertaking transactions with persons and organizations so involved and have ordered them to report all useful information in this area to the monitoring authorities and the legal authorities. The blocking of bank assets of these organizations and persons has been ordered. The Government of Luxembourg has expressed to the United States once again its determination to cooperate closely to guarantee a prompt exchange of useful information in connection with the struggle against the financing of terrorism. After the verifications carried out proactively and in concert with the American authorities, no real link between the financial sector and terrorists or their financiers have been proven to date.</div>
	<div class="p">The 12 international conventions directed against international terrorism must be implemented, and their implementation must be immediate. The necessary ratification procedures, which are sometimes difficult, reinforce our dedication to the international rules defined jointly. On 20 September Luxembourg signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and will try to ratify it as soon as possible. Other conventions have been signed at the regional level. On 26 September 2001, Luxembourg joined the European Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime.</div>
	<div class="p">Our will to cooperate with our partners in the struggle against terrorism in general and terrorism financing in particular is also documented by a veritable legal and juridical arsenal in place for many years, and which is in the process of being adapted by implementing commitments undertaken with the European Union and at the international level.</div>
	<div class="p">The authorities of my country are firmly resolved to participate fully in the action of the international community against terrorism; they will make their contribution to ensure that joint action by the international community will be crowned as soon as possible by convincing results.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me to convey our congratulations to the President on his assuming the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to wish him every success in his important tasks. He has already shown at the beginning of his presidency remarkable speed of action and efficiency in the face of the tragic events that have affected the plans for the fifty-sixth General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">We also place on record our appreciation to Mr. Harri Holkeri for his effective leadership as President of the last General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Speaking about acts of terrorism, none of us is likely to forget the terrorist attacks of 11 September in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, which caused tremendous casualties in lives and assets. In the wake of these tragic events, on 12 September 2001, on behalf of the Government and people of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mr. Khamtay Siphandone, President of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, sent a message of condolence to the President of the United States of America, expressing his profound sorrow to the United States Government and the families of the victims, reaffirming our consistent policy to cooperate with the international community in the struggle against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Any terrorist attack, wherever and by whomever it is committed, must be seen not only as an assault against innocent people, but also as a threat to the stability of nations and to international peace and security. It affects the very basis of societies and impedes the full enjoyment of basic human rights and the fundamental freedoms of people. Indeed, the consequences of terrorist attacks are unspeakable. In this vein, the Lao People's Democratic Republic joins other nations in condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and supports the implementation of General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1">resolution 56/1</a>, which calls for international cooperation in the fight against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The challenge we are facing now assumes a worldwide dimension. It is, therefore, important to ensure that our response to it should be organized in a way that brings justice and strengthens international peace and security based on general principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. In this fight, the United Nations should play a crucial role and address the issue more effectively at its current session and beyond.</div>
	<div class="p">In light of the increasingly sophisticated and extensive network of organized terrorist acts, the international community more than ever before needs concerted action, and this should be done through the establishment of an effective global framework and the development of a broad and comprehensive strategy. In this context, we welcome the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism under General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-60">resolution 49/60</a> of 1994, Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the existing conventions on international terrorism, including two international conventions, one for the suppression of terrorist bombing and the other for the suppression of the financing of terrorism. The adoption of these important instruments is clear testimony to this endeavour.</div>
	<div class="p">We also applaud the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee to reinforce the legal regime for countering international terrorism and welcome the Indian proposed draft for a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. We hope that, in order to meet the challenge before us, this draft convention, now under negotiation, can soon be finalized, clearly laying down an effective mechanism whereby a State party can exercise jurisdiction over terrorist offences, ensuring that the alleged offender will be brought to justice and not escape punishment, and enhancing international cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p">The early adoption and entry into force of this convention will generate momentum for the international community in its fight against terrorism and provide an important framework for national and international actions geared to combat this evil. We will continue to work closely and positively with all other delegations to ensure its early adoption.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community has never expected that acts of terrorism would be carried out so deliberately, so inhumanly and so destructively. One country alone, whether rich or powerful, cannot fight effectively against this scourge. The whole world must unite in its effort and work together in order to defeat it. For its part, the Lao People's Democratic Republic stands ready and will do its utmost to contribute to this fight against terrorism in order to ensure that succeeding generations can live without fear in a peaceful and safe world.</div>

	<div class="p">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the 14 members States of the Caribbean Community that are members of the United Nations: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.</div>
	<div class="p">The Caribbean Community joins in solidarity with all member States in condemning the vicious and diabolical terrorist acts on New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, on 11 September 2001. The terror of those acts has resonated throughout the international community, as many foreign nationals, including some of our own from the Caribbean, are counted among the missing and the dead. These were not only assaults on the people of the United States of America. These were attacks on all civil society and humankind.</div>
	<div class="p">While we have only begun to address the grief and sorrow for the loss of lives suffered in those attacks, some of us have been shocked into realization and others sadly are reminded of the macabre nature of terrorism. Terrorism breeds within societies and exploits the infrastructure of democracy, freedom and tolerance. It releases its wrath upon the innocent unknowing, intending to infiltrate those societies and their infrastructure and thus perpetuating economic and humanitarian crises.</div>
	<div class="p">We are all vulnerable to international terrorism in whatever form and regardless of its immediate target. Together we must take concerted action to respond vigorously to this threat to the international community and the fundamental values of democracy, peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community has advanced a united approach in the struggle against international terrorism. We recall Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1368 (2001) and General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1">resolution 56/1</a>, as well as the Organization of American States (OAS) resolution on "strengthening hemispheric cooperation to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism" and the OAS Declaration of Solidarity, both of 21 September 2001. The Caribbean Community reaffirms its support for these resolutions and declaration and endeavours to implement them.</div>
	<div class="p">In this context, we must continue to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to respond to the international community's need not only to bring to justice the perpetrators and the sponsors of terrorism, but also to put an end to such activities through international cooperation. Accordingly, we must establish preventive mechanisms against terrorism and strive for the full implementation and observation of existing international legal instruments aimed at the prevention and eradication of terrorism and related activities. Our strategies should be comprehensive and multifaceted, with an overarching goal to study and eliminate the causes and sources of terrorism, whether political, social or economic.</div>
	<div class="p">We fully support the work being undertaken by the Ad Hoc Committee on terrorism to draft a comprehensive convention against terrorism. We urge the earliest conclusion of its work so that the international community can move forward expeditiously to address this scourge effectively. In the meantime, we in the Caribbean will continue to play our parts in the effort to stamp out international criminal activity, including illegal traffic in small arms and drugs and money-laundering. Indeed, many CARICOM States were among those that signed the Convention against transnational organized crime last week.</div>
	<div class="p">We have only begun to experience the broader effects of terrorism on the conduct of our lives and on the social and economic well-being of our individual Member States. It is now more important than ever that we work to ensure that fear and paralysis, on which terrorism thrives, does not circumscribe our decisions and actions. Let us all heed the call to seek to restore normalcy to our daily activities. The Caribbean community pledges its support to a united front to combat terrorism in all its aspects and to cooperate in a global effort to restore to our people and the international community renewed confidence in international peace, security and freedom.</div>

	<div class="p">Once again the report by the Secretary-General has underscored an urgent problem that needs decisive action by the international community to combat it -- the danger posed by international terrorism. The report clearly indicates the pervasive nature of international terrorism. Innocent people all over the world have become victims of this scourge. No country is immune to it. The danger posed by terrorism to all peoples of the world has never been more evident. The need for international cooperation to rid mankind of this scourge has never been more urgent. The heinous acts of terrorism perpetrated on 11 September, is a powerful reminder and a wake-up call for all of us. Those mindless acts killed over 6000 people from 80 countries.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation would once again like to convey our condolences to the United States and the countries that have suffered from these acts of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorist acts are acts of barbarism. We fully share the view that these acts are attacks against civilization itself. Terrorism victimizes innocent civilians. It makes no distinction as to whether they are women, children or the elderly. It undermines national stability. International terrorism has gained magnitude over the years and now poses a threat to international peace and security. Places of transportation become targets of terrorism. Railroads and highways are mined, killing innocent commuters. Embassies find themselves becoming targets of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Myanmar has also suffered from these heinous acts. We became victims of international terrorism when a powerful bomb exploded at our Martyr Mausoleum, in an attempt to assassinate a visiting Head of State on Myanmar soil. Myanmar stands totally against terrorism in all forms and manifestations. Our criminal code, capital punishment for high crimes and other special laws form a solid legal basis to deter and combat terrorism. We are also vigorously enforcing them.</div>
	<div class="p">However, terrorism is a global phenomenon. We need a joint organized response of the international community. I am heartened that the recent terrorist acts have resulted in swift and effective measures by the United Nations. This Assembly has passed a resolution, and the Security Council has passed two resolutions to combat this global menace.</div>
	<div class="p">International terrorism is a threat to peace and security. Therefore, the United Nations should play a leading role in combating it. To deal with the changing circumstances, we must also strengthen the capacity of the United Nations and international agencies dealing with terrorist matters, such as the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the Centre for International Crime Prevention, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Interpol.</div>
	<div class="p">Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> set out detailed measures, within the Charter, to combat international terrorism effectively. It specifically calls for Member States to cooperate in suppressing the financing of terrorism, in criminal investigations and in the exchange of information on possible terrorist acts. It will no longer be possible for terrorists to take advantage of humanitarian concerns and operate under the guise of refugees.</div>
	<div class="p">There can be no excuse for terrorism. It must not be condoned on any grounds whatsoever. We recognize, however, that poverty breeds discontent and alienation. Poverty alleviation could be an effective measure in our efforts to combat terrorism. Here, it is pertinent to recall that our leaders in their Millennium Declaration resolved to halve the number of poor by 2015. In our fight against terrorism we must address the issue of development.</div>
	<div class="p">My country has always opposed and will always oppose terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are firm in our resolve to fight this menace through closer cooperation with the United Nations and hand in hand with all other countries.</div>

	Mr. Ouane (Mali)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me first to convey to the President heartfelt congratulations in his election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I would like to take this opportunity to assure him of the full support of my delegation in the performance of his duties. Allow me also to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his report of 3 July 2001 contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-56-160">A/56/160</a>, which takes stock of progress made in various areas relating to this item.</div>
	<div class="p">Today's discussion is a timely one, since it is occurring just a few weeks after the bloody attacks that plunged the United States into grief on 11 September, causing a great loss of life among people of many nationalities.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to recall here that the Government of the Republic of Mali, in a statement of 13 September 2001, strongly condemned these heinous acts and expressed solidarity to the people and Government of the United States. A minute of silence was observed in the memory of all victims of the 11 September attacks during the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the independence of Mali.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition to being tragic, the events of 11 September 2001 remind us of the fragility of the international system in the face of the threat to international peace and security posed by international terrorism. These events also remind us of the burning need to make a comprehensive, concerted and sustained effort to deal with it.</div>
	<div class="p">In that regard, my delegation welcomes the outstanding work done by the Ad Hoc Committee established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a> to elaborate a comprehensive convention on terrorism and a convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism, and to consider the idea of convening an international conference on terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Convinced that the fight against terrorism is a long-term struggle, Mali calls for greater international cooperation within the framework of a global concerted strategy. That strategy, which must be under the auspices of the United Nations, means, of course, signing, ratifying and acceding to existing instruments. It also requires that members of the international community with the means to do so should help developing countries to strengthen their individual capacities to combat terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Likewise, we welcome the adoption of Security Council of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, on 28 September 2001, which puts the United Nations at the forefront of the struggle against terrorism. The resolution represents an important stage in the international community's growing awareness of the need to combat terrorism, as it highlights the urgent need for States to cooperate and requires them, in particular, to put an end to financial and logistical assistance to terrorist networks and groups from countries harbouring terrorists.</div>
	<div class="p">Moreover, my delegation fully support all measures to strengthen the Secretariat's capacity to combat terrorism, in particular in the areas of information gathering, analysis and providing support to developing countries. Similarly, my country fully supports the proposal to convene a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations to devise an organized and concerted response to international terrorism in all of its forms and manifestations.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to conclude my statement as I began it, by reiterating Mali's strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Mali, which is party to many international and regional instruments to fight terrorism, will continue its struggle against terrorism with determination, while respecting the rule of law and the rules of international law. In taking part in today's deliberations, my delegation hopes that this debate will lead to a unanimous condemnation of terrorism and to the taking of specific measures and commitments to meet the challenge posed by terrorism to the international community.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Ms. Thunyani" nation="Malawi" language="">
	Ms. Thunyani (Malawi)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Let me begin by congratulating the President most warmly on his election as President of the General Assembly. I pledge Malawi's support and cooperation to him as we all work together to find sustainable solutions to the numerous and multifaceted challenges facing humankind.</div>
	<div class="p">As this is the first time that Malawi takes the floor since the tragic acts of terrorism against the United States, I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Government and people of Malawi, to convey our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the United States and, in particular, to the families, dependants and friends of all the innocent victims of that profoundly inexplicable tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them all. Malawi condemns in no uncertain terms such inexcusable and senseless acts of terror, and would like to add its voice to the chorus of calls for urgent steps to hunt down, bring to justice and punish all those responsible in one way or another for those dastardly acts of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The extremely sad events of 11 September on the soil of the United States will go down in the annals of human history as one of the most callous and insensitive acts of barbarism that any human being can perpetrate against another. They mark a very bad start for the new millennium and dim our shared hopes and aspirations for a stable world in which everyone's divine right to personal security and freedom to pursue their chosen social, economic, cultural and religious practices is guaranteed.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorist acts do not at all justify whatever cause they purport to serve, and therefore deserve to be punished by whatever means available to the international community of nations. Terrorism, as evidenced in the recent uncalled for attacks against the free and peace-loving people of our host country, stands out as the single biggest challenge to our common humanity. It poses a real and present threat to our very survival and clearly intends to deprive human kind for a long time to come of its most highly prized treasure, namely, the quality of peace, security and understanding among nations. Those are the key underpinnings of sustainable human progress.</div>
	<div class="p">As it is now evident that no country or nation is immune to the devastating and destructive effects of terrorism, it has become all the more urgent and imperative for the international community to make resolute, concrete and collaborative efforts in support of existing and newly conceived measures to combat and eliminate terrorism, which is a threat to every positive human endeavour. There is a need for every nation to make terrorism its number one enemy and to devote every human, intellectual and material resource to the global effort to stem its tide.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is a serious challenge to the values systems that the civilized world stands for, and a threat to what humanity strives to achieve, namely, socio-economic liberalism and political plurality, the rule of law and international peace, and stability and understanding for the universal common good. Every concerted effort must therefore be made to eradicate this deadly scourge before it brings present and future generations under its bondage.</div>
	<div class="p">In that regard, I would like to express my delegation's grateful appreciation to both the General Assembly and the Security Council for their immediate condemnation of those terrorist attacks responsible for a colossal loss of life and the costly destruction of strategic infrastructure in the cities affected. I also applaud all the national Governments, regional and international organizations and civil society world-wide for supporting the mobilization of the widest possible global coalition against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Given that international terrorism is fast becoming more sophisticated, ingenious and inventive in its forms, manifestations and methods of operation, certainly no single country can fight it on its own. It is therefore incumbent upon the United Nations to take up the mantle of mobilizing and mandating an effective global campaign against this scourge. That calls for quick and resolute concrete action to strengthen international cooperation and to muster global political will to move beyond the usual rhetorical pledges of support, which frustrate progress on numerous agreed global programmes.</div>
	<div class="p">In that connection, I join delegations that have already spoken in support of calls to inject new momentum into the existing body of international treaties against terrorism so as to reinforce the global campaign against that scourge. Further, my delegation supports the call upon the Secretary-General to see to it that all States Members of the Organization participate actively through adherence to and efficient implementation of existing anti-terrorist legal instruments, including the 1996 Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism. Also important are other key conventions that have emerged and those that continue to be under formulation in the Sixth Committee, such as the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the draft convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">In the current international climate, with its heightened sense of insecurity, which has serious adverse implications for global socio-economic activities, it behoves delegations to the Sixth Committee to set aside differences that could stifle progress in their work and to show flexibility on their respective national positions so as to complete the formulation of the draft comprehensive convention sponsored by India last year on measures to eliminate international terrorism. That instrument would be all-encompassing and would provide a broader and better framework for all the existing conventions designed to counter terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish in conclusion to reiterate my Government's unequivocal condemnation of the irrational exploitation of any cause to advance the misguided extremist designs that have such wide-ranging destructive consequences for the world. I also reaffirm Malawi's total support for any United Nations-mandated hunt for the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks against the United States, and any subsequent continued drive against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Abelian" nation="Armenia" language="">
	Mr. Abelian (Armenia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I would like first to join those who from this rostrum have expressed their condolences to the Government and the people of the United States on the unprecedented loss of human life during the 11 September terrorist attacks in New York City and in Washington, D.C. We also extend our condolences and sympathy to those other Member States whose citizens lost their lives in the World Trade Center or aboard the hijacked aircraft. Armenia strongly condemns those crimes against all peaceful democratic nations and against the very idea of peaceful coexistence and a humane world order. The implications of the tragedy do not stop with the United States; they impact the entire world community. The perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of this outrage must be held accountable and must be brought to justice by all available means.</div>
	<div class="p">Unfortunately, the first resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its present session had to deal with the tragic events of 11 September. But at the same time, that short document is unique testimony to the determination of the world community to fight and eradicate the evil of terrorism. It is a short but strong message, which, to use the words of the Secretary-General,</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"reaffirms, with all our strength, our common humanity and the values that we share. We shall not allow them to be overthrown". (<i><a href="../pdf/A-56-PV.7">A/56/PV.7</a></i>)</div>
	<div class="p">We would like to commend the Secretary-General for his readiness to engage the whole United Nations system in the fight against international terrorism, and we assure him that the Republic of Armenia will support and contribute to all actions undertaken by the United Nations in that regard.</div>
	<div class="p">Armenia welcomes Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, unanimously adopted by the Council last week. It is a significant document which provides us with an effective anti-terrorist mechanism and defines the obligations of every country in the global war against that evil. We declare our readiness to abide by all provisions of that resolution, as well as to contribute to all anti-terrorist measures outlined in it.</div>
	<div class="p">The fact that international terrorists still find safe harbour in some countries makes the fight against them particularly difficult. It is widely known that in some countries terrorist cells are disguised as non-governmental organizations or charitable funds, and that in most cases the national authorities turn a blind eye to their activities, trying to use them for their own national interests.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations, which has considerable experience in monitoring the human rights situation around the world, could also include international terrorism in the same list of priorities. The United Nations can play a very positive role encouraging Member States to exchange operational information about the terrorists and their networks. The existing United Nations mechanisms in the fields of the illicit traffic in small arms, drug control, nuclear proliferation and other areas should acquire clearly pronounced anti-terrorist accents. Particular effort should be made to prevent terrorists from getting access to weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, biological or chemical. We cannot ignore the possibility that some terrorist networks are already capable of creating their own biological and chemical weapons and facilities. It is imperative that all Member States increase their cooperation in the fight against terrorism and abide by the principles of all the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">It is regrettable that we have to bring forward the issue of international terrorism in a year that has been proclaimed by the General Assembly as the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations. One can assume that evil actions of such proportions are capable of discrediting the idea of dialogue, reviving instead the ill-fated predictions of a clash among civilizations. The lesson that we must learn today is clear: political action and military operations can bring to justice the persons responsible for terrorist attacks, but they cannot shake the foundations of the ideas motivating them and poisoning their minds with hatred and anger. That is where initiatives such as the dialogue among civilizations can prove effective. But the dialogue should not limit itself to high podiums and scientific conferences; it should find immediate and effective ways to reach out to ordinary people in the street, who are far too often influenced by extreme nationalists and religious fanatics.</div>
	<div class="p">Armenia is celebrating the 1,700th anniversary of its adoption of Christianity as a State religion. For 17 centuries we have adhered to a system of values deeply rooted in that religion of love and forgiveness. But we reject the narrow-mindedness of those who claim that only one religion nourishes the ideas of freedom and democracy. In any religion we can find the ideals of great humanist values. In our view, the United Nations must spare no effort to prevent the emerging danger of villainizing entire nations and religions. No religion is evil. No religion justifies killing innocent people. But any religion can become a deadly weapon if utilized and manipulated where entire communities are struck by poverty, disease, illiteracy and bitter hopelessness.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations should redouble its efforts in the fields of economic development and poverty eradication, since these are the strategic battlefields in the war against terrorism. Donor countries can contribute to the success of that war not only by sending military force to the areas of concern, but also by providing more generous financial assistance to the poorest, directly or through United Nations agencies.</div>
	<div class="p">In the famous Dead Sea scrolls, written more than 2,000 years ago, there is a story about the final battle in the future between the "sons of light" and the "sons of darkness". That battle seems to have begun. Its outcome depends solely on our combined efforts and determination.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Slade" nation="Samoa" language="">
	Mr. Slade (Samoa)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Mr. Vice-President, let me say what an honour it is to be at the rostrum while you are presiding over the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Samoa joins the rest of the world in its strong and unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist attacks of 11 September in New York; Washington, D.C.; and Pennsylvania. On behalf of my Government, I want to convey to the people of the United States our sense of horror and sorrow and to say that we feel most deeply their pain.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me also to express our deep admiration for the leadership of, and for the magnificent example and courage shown by, the American people. What we have seen of the national response in our host city in particular is proof beyond doubt of the extraordinary strength of this great democracy and the indomitable spirit of its people.</div>
	<div class="p">This was a most monstrous crime and act of premeditated evil. Thousands of innocent people were murdered, people trapped in buildings, people given absolutely no warning. To their families and friends -- and we note that citizens of many other countries represented in this Hall were lost -- we extend our warm and heartfelt condolences.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is a direct and most serious threat to democracy, to the free exercise of human rights and to economic and social development. This has never been clearer than in the aftermath of these terrible attacks against the United States.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism threatens fundamental rights because it is blind to, and the very antithesis of, human rights and fundamental freedoms and what is decent in society. As demonstrated time and again, terrorism has no respect for social order or for human life and property. The particular difficulty for law enforcement agencies is that terrorism takes not one but different forms. What makes it especially dangerous today is the fanaticism that drives it, the choice of increasingly dangerous and sophisticated weaponry, and what appears to be a calculated preference for dramatic and lethal devastation.</div>
	<div class="p">The horrific events of 11 September have served to highlight not only the need for a concerted and effective international response but have also drawn attention to the inadequacy of the traditional forms of law enforcement in combating it.</div>
	<div class="p">As others have sought to emphasize, this was an assault not just on the United States of America but on all States. It is so because it is a blow against the very principles this Organization stands for: international order, peace, human rights and freedoms, and the rule of law. It is, in truth, an attack on shared global values, an attack against all humanity.</div>
	<div class="p">That is why this is a defining moment for the United Nations. There needs to be an effective response from the international community. It must a response of clear and demonstrated solidarity, one that we believe the United Nations is uniquely placed to build and to advance.</div>
	<div class="p">More than ever before we need the clear commitment of every Member State to concrete actions against those responsible -- actions that need to be taken now and for the long term. In doing so, we need to keep clear the distinction between the individual perpetrators and the innocent civilians, between those who commit these atrocities and those who may simply share their religious beliefs, ethnicity or national origin.</div>
	<div class="p">We need to bear in mind that the fight against terrorism cannot be separated from the task of preventing organized crime, preventing the spread of small arms and other weapons, and containing and ending conflict. We need also to ensure that the conditions of poverty and despair that breed ignorance, hatred, violence and extremism are properly and effectively addressed. We need above all to remain resolute in upholding the rule of law and the principles that underpin the rule of law.</div>
	<div class="p">The clear affirmation of these principles and of the norms of international humanitarian law will help deny to the perpetrators of these crimes whatever they seek to gain from violence and destruction.</div>
	<div class="p">The view of my Government is that there is no room for moral equivocation. The deliberate taking of innocent civilian life, regardless of cause or grievance, is without justification in law and is morally unacceptable.</div>
	<div class="p">In this connection, we consider it essential to renew efforts to promote the rapid entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. A functioning International Criminal Court for the prosecution of terrorist acts amounting to crimes against humanity, as we regard the attacks on the United States to be, would provide a vital component in the international armoury against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations and its agencies have developed a wide range of international legal instruments that enable the international community to take action to eradicate terrorism, including the extradition and prosecution of offenders and the suppression of money-laundering.</div>
	<div class="p">Twelve global conventions and protocols as well as numerous declarations have been adopted. The Secretary-General has now led the call to all Member States to ratify and to implement all counter-terrorism instruments. It is a call we fully support. We support also early and concerted efforts to finalize the draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism and to draw up a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Such efforts will be in line with the strong condemnation issued from the General Assembly on 12 September and the Assembly's call for urgent action to enhance international cooperation to prevent and eradicate acts of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">In our view, it would be a fitting conclusion to this weeklong debate for the Assembly to issue a clear reaffirmation of urgent action, making clear the specific steps to be taken.</div>
	<div class="p">Samoa applauds the action taken by the Security Council. Rightly, the Council has declared the terrorist attacks in the United States a threat to international peace and security. The Council's unanimous and momentous <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, adopted last Friday, building swiftly on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1368(2001)">resolution 1368 (2001)</a>, sets out in greater detail what needs to be done. We appreciate in particular the decision to establish a committee to monitor implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001)">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. These resolutions combine to give the clearest signal of the international community's determination to take concrete action against the financing, training and movement of terrorists and the need for all States to cooperate in any campaign against them. We believe they provide the necessary basis to secure the broadest possible international support and cooperation for the global campaign against terrorism.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Since this is the first time my delegation is taking the floor during this session of the General Assembly, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Seung-soo Han on his well-deserved election. I offer my support in our endeavour to ensure the successful outcome of this debate.</div>
	<div class="p">In the context within which we are meeting, mere words here may pale into insignificance. Like that of all speakers, our statement is delivered against the background of a brutal attack against our host country. I wish to express once more the deepest sympathy of His Majesty's Government and the people of Brunei Darussalam to the people of the United States, to the Mayor and people of New York and to all countries whose nationals were among the victims of the terrorist attacks committed in this city. Brunei Darussalam joins other Members of the United Nations in strongly condemning all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as unjustifiable, wherever and by whomever committed.</div>
	<div class="p">The 11 September incidents showed that no country, big or small, is safe from terrorist attacks. Terrorism has significant effects on the stability of nations and adverse consequences for social and economic development. Such indiscriminate acts disrespect human life and dignity and deny peace and harmony as professed by all religions. It is therefore important for the international community to work together towards preventing and eliminating all forms of terrorism by engaging in closer cooperation and coordination among States. This calls for a comprehensive, pragmatic and balanced approach. The use of force should only be a last resort and should take into account the ensuing humanitarian effects, which may give rise to another further vicious cycle of violence.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, my delegation welcomes and supports the statement made by the Secretary-General that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"This Organization is the natural forum in which to build such a universal coalition. It alone can give global legitimacy to the long-term struggle against terrorism." (<i><a href="../pdf/A-56-PV.7">A/56/PV.7</a></i>)</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, my delegation agrees with the Secretary-General that the response should be through the reaffirmation of the rule of law at the international and national levels.</div>
	<div class="p">The fact that all of us are here today to participate in this debate is an indication of the gravity of this issue and of our firm commitment to addressing this issue. We agree with the general sentiment expressed during this debate that some sense of urgency should be injected into this issue.</div>
	<div class="p">For the past several years, the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-201">resolution 51/201</a> has been considering the issue of ways to eliminate terrorism. In this respect, it is our hope that the Ad Hoc Committee will make further progress in its work on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism. In our view, such a convention would give a proper framework to our efforts to combat terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">As an indication of our commitment, Brunei Darussalam has already acceded to six conventions related to terrorism and is in the final stages of acceding to the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. We support the leading role of the United Nations in taking effective measures to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts. At the national level, Brunei Darussalam has already enacted and implemented measures through the Money Laundering Order and the Criminal Conduct Order. Moreover, meaningful and enforceable regulations of the trust, company administration, insurance and banking industries were legislated and entered into force last year. Thus, we feel that Brunei Darussalam has already taken tentative steps to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist activities.</div>

	Mr. Nesho (Albania)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The terrorist attack of 11 September against the people of the United States, committed by a criminal organization and barbarians who killed thousands of innocent people, was an attack against the entire civilized world, freedom and democracy. Albania strongly condemns this criminal act, unprecedented in the history of the world, which constitutes a threat to international peace and security, and demands that its perpetrators be immediately brought to justice. We owe this to the innocent victims, to the freedom and democracy that were attacked and to the victory of progressive forces against evil-doers and of all nations that love freedom and democracy.</div>
	<div class="p">The Albanian nation has expressed its deepest condolences for the loss of life and its solidarity with the United States of America and believes that nothing in the world can change the freedom-loving spirit of the American people and their great leadership, indispensable to building a free and democratic world.</div>
	<div class="p">In a statement of 14 September, Mr. Ilir Meta, the Prime Minister of Albania, stated:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"In the just fight of the civilized world against terrorism and the criminal forces of darkness, Albania stands with the United States and our allies of the European Union by putting at their disposal not only its territory and military bases, but also all the necessary infrastructure and human resources."</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is a threat to international peace and security and, as such, should be fought with all the means, determination and cooperation of all countries. All our nations should stand united and with a high sense of responsibility to declare an uncompromising and multifaceted war against terrorism. Albania fully supports the action of the international community against terrorism and stands ready to make every contribution that will be needed.</div>
	<div class="p">Albania believes that the United Nations has every opportunity and all the necessary resources to play a leading and coordinating role in the effort of the international community to eradicate the scourge of international terrorism. In this framework, Albania is in favour of adopting a comprehensive international convention against terrorism. Furthermore, Albania strongly supports Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), which clearly demonstrate that we should join our efforts, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to cut off the financing of terrorist organizations, to collect and exchange the necessary information in order to prevent future terrorist attacks, to deny safe haven to terrorists and to destroy their bases.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is a scourge that takes innocent lives, threatens the values of humanity, human rights and freedom and impedes development and world progress. The fight against terrorism should rise above the individual interests of States. Terrorism cannot be justified by differences in social development or cultural and social disparities. It can in no way be confused with the legitimate struggle of a people for freedom and self-determination. Equality and respect for democratic rights, furthermore, cannot be used to justify the intransigent stance of some countries in not respecting the rights of citizens in multi-ethnic societies and the principles and love of democracy therein.</div>
	<div class="p">Albania, a democratic country that aspires only to integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, not only is working to ratify all the international instruments against terrorism, but also has adopted an entire range of legislation and is continuing its fight against illegal trafficking and organized crime that can serve as a support for terrorist acts. The legal provisions of Albanian criminal law condemn terrorist activity and, on the basis of this legislation, there has been established very good and fruitful cooperation against illegal trafficking between Albanian justice and police authorities and their neighbouring counterparts in the countries of the European Union and in the United States of America.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, we have speeded up the legal procedures to facilitate Albania's accession to the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In addition, as a Balkan country, Albania welcomes and is ready to provide assistance to any regional or European initiatives to eradicate terrorism and terrorist organizations.</div>
	<div class="p">On 11 September 2001, terrorists attacked the United States of America, one of the main founders of the United Nations, an Organization that gathered together all of the countries of the world to defend peace and freedom. We -- all the States Members of the United Nations -- must act together in fighting terrorism. Acting in the service of freedom and for the future of civilization, we must form a broad, long-term coalition to achieve our mission. Otherwise, we will be trapped by the dark forces of irrationality, primitivism and regression, living in fear of violence and criminal acts.</div>
	<div class="p">As the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, The Honourable Tony Blair, said just a few days ago,</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"There is no compromise possible with such people, no meeting of minds, no point of understanding with such terror. Just a choice: defeat it, or be defeated by it. And defeat it we must."</div>
	<div class="p">We believe that our victory in this long fight will further increase the prestige and the role of the United Nations in the world and bring the Organization closer to the city of New York, our host city, as well as contribute to its speedy recovery.</div>

	Mr. Farhdi (Afghanistan)

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The recent dramatic and terrible events started in the United States at about 9 a.m. on 11 September. However, just two days earlier, on 9 September, oceans away in Afghanistan, two terrorists of Arab origin, posing as journalists, assassinated the greatest military leader of free Afghanistan, Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud. The diabolic assassination plot was later unravelled and shown to be the prelude to what we all bitterly witnessed in the United States thereafter, as the assassins were all but confirmed to have been sent by a sole mastermind: Osama bin Laden.</div>
	<div class="p">International terrorists knew that Afghanistan would be the focus of military reprisals, and thus targeted the most valiant and towering leader of the anti-Taliban and anti-bin Laden fighters, as he was within their immediate reach.</div>
	<div class="p">There are as many as 12 internationally binding conventions or protocols on combating terrorism, as well as General Assembly resolutions on the prevention and suppression of terrorism, particularly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-60">resolution 49/60</a> and its annex, adopted by consensus in December 1994, on measures to eliminate terrorism. Yet some countries have defiantly resorted to terrorism as a means of achieving their politico-military agenda; Pakistan exemplifies them best. Referring to the Pakistani military intelligence -- the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) -- the world-renowned expert on Afghan affairs, Mr. Anthony Davis, of <i>Jane's Defence Weekly</i>, perhaps defined the situation best. In his analysis of 26 September, he wrote:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"How far the [Pakistani] ISI's field officers will wish to cooperate in the destruction of a force [the Taliban] they helped create and sustained, is uncertain."</div>
	<div class="p">Let me say what we have said time and again: Pakistan's policies vis--vis Afghanistan, dating from 1992, have been dead wrong all along. Those policies have transformed most of the territory of Afghanistan into a nucleus of global terrorist plans. They provided a free hand to the Pakistani clergy whom General Musharraf himself only now -- he did not do so before -- calls "religious extremists" that support the Taliban. The Taliban still provide shelter to Osama bin Laden, their hero of jihad. Ironically, the truth is that he is the arch-enemy of genuine Islam. Islam demands moderation and prohibits terrorism. Killing innocents is not only un-Islamic but goes against Islam.</div>
	<div class="p">Pakistan is now harvesting a dangerously negative by-product of its hegemonic Afghan policy. Pakistan's pursuit of a subservient regime in Kabul with the aim of securing "strategic depth" has ended in a real "strategic ditch", as today the Pashtuns of Afghanistan see dreadful perils in Pakistani Afghan policy.</div>
	<div class="p">The recent willy-nilly volte-face by Pakistan's military clique, which took place under strong pressure from the international community, in no way exonerates Pakistan's ISI from the crimes against humanity committed in Afghanistan in alliance with Osama and the Taliban mercenaries. Pakistan's ISI is solely responsible for creating, organizing and instigating terrorist activities in Afghanistan and for recruiting people to take part in them.</div>
	<div class="p">The religious schools in Pakistan -- the madrasahs -- which are closely linked to the ISI, educate and indoctrinate terrorists, seeking to enforce Pakistan's expansionist designs in the region.</div>
	<div class="p">In his reports on the situation in Afghanistan over the past two years, the Secretary-General has highlighted the presence and the role of foreign fighters in Afghanistan, particularly those of Pakistan and Osama bin Laden. The terrorist camps that have been created in Afghanistan are training centres where Arab and Pakistani fighters are trained by professional ISI military instructors. They are trained not only to kill Afghans, but to carry out missions in Kashmir and other countries, with the aim of waging a war according Pakistani designs.</div>
	<div class="p">The Islamic State of Afghanistan considers each of the components of the Pakistani-ISI-Taliban-bin-Laden evil triangle equally responsible for the many crimes committed against the people of Afghanistan and peoples beyond.</div>
	<div class="p">The criminal charges against the evil alliance put an equal burden of responsibility on each of its components. The Pakistani Government, especially the ISI policy makers and high-ranking military officers who have been behind the dangerous Talibanization of the region and the forging of alliances between bin Laden, the Taliban and extremist religious groups of Pakistan, are to be considered as criminals. Furthermore, those countries, individuals and mercantilist circles that have contributed to the creation of this monster in the region must be held accountable for their acts and deeds.</div>
	<div class="p">The armed resistance to the Taliban and bin Laden was not invented as a result of the events of 11 September in the United States. The United Front of the Islamic State of Afghanistan has had to fight the Taliban and bin Laden for the past six years. Also we have had to resist thousands of armed Pakistani fighters called "volunteers", known as the Pakistani Taliban.</div>
	<div class="p">Pakistan officially recognized the Taliban puppet regime, which was forged by Pakistan itself. Today some 8,000 armed Pakistanis, still called "volunteers", who are sent by the ISI, are still fighting all over Afghanistan alongside the Taliban and bin Laden. This was how northern cities like Maimana, Mazar-I-Sharif, Kunduz and, only last year, Taluqan, were invaded by the Taliban. The Pakistani ISI also transited into Afghanistan thousands of Arab youths to serve bin Laden.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">Let the following points be clear to the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">First, the Taliban mercenaries did not participate in Afghanistan's war of independence against the Red Army from 1979 to 1989. At that time, many of them were children in the Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, the Taliban do not represent the Afghan nation, nor do they represent the Pashtuns of Afghanistan. Rather, they have been imposed on Afghanistan by a foreign country.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, the Taliban's beliefs and thoughts require Afghanistan to return to the Middle Ages. Everyone knows about their harsh behaviour towards women and their hatred for women's education.</div>
	<div class="p">Let the following matters also be known to the Assembly and the world at large.</div>
	<div class="p">First, there is no absolute ethnic majority in Afghanistan. Ethnic groups are relative minorities.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, even the Pashtuns and the Tajiks each constitute less than one third of the Afghan population. This is the stark and irrefutable reality on the ground of present-day Afghanistan.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, the Hazaras, the Uzbeks, the Turkmen and the Baluchs also constitute major ethnic communities. There are many other ethnic groups.</div>
	<div class="p">Fourthly, however, all the Afghans are extremely patriotic. They do not tolerate foreign domination, even if it is disguised as religion.</div>
	<div class="p">Fifthly, the current Afghan patriotic resistance, thus comprising all ethnic groups in Afghanistan, can never be suppressed by any demagogy or divisive intrigue.</div>
	<div class="p">Sixthly, no political system can be maintained in Afghanistan unless it is broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully representative, as called for by numerous United Nations resolutions. An independent, peaceful and stable Afghanistan would inevitably serve the legitimate interests of all neighbouring countries, including Pakistan.</div>
	<div class="p">Seventhly, Pakistan has constantly advised the rest of the world to "engage" with the Taliban. This has proved to be like trying to milk a bull. Let us ask: Is any country of the world satisfied with the links it may have established with the Taliban? In fact, the Taliban mercenaries believe that non-Taliban and foreigners can never be right unless they act according to their wishes.</div>
	<div class="p">Eighthly, and finally, there is no good or bad Taliban that one can draw a distinction between. Once the Taliban are defeated, nobody will be happy to be called Taliban.</div>
	<div class="p">The Islamic State of Afghanistan fully shares the views expressed in the Assembly that the struggle against terrorism requires broad global cooperation. We believe that global efforts need to be coordinated and put into practice under the auspices of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">The Islamic State of Afghanistan stands steadfastly committed and ready to join the international community in its endeavour for the prevention and suppression of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to conclude by launching an appeal to all member nations to genuinely help the weary people of Afghanistan in their long, uphill battle against terrorism. Our people have been hit hard by terrorism throughout the dark years of the Pakistani-ISI-Osama-bin-Laden mercenaries' reign of terror. Afghanistan has been a victim and a hostage to international terrorism until now and is still tightly besieged by it.</div>
