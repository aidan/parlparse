	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council is appalled by the horrific death of members of the Russian diplomatic mission in Iraq who had been kidnapped by a terrorist group and later ruthlessly and in cold blood executed by their captors.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council in the strongest possible terms condemns this crime committed by the terrorists and conveys its deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased and to the people and Government of the Russian Federation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council confirms that no cause can justify such acts of terror as this crime and previous attacks on foreign diplomats committed by the terrorists, and reaffirms its utmost determination to combat terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council urges all States, in accordance with their obligation under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, to cooperate actively in efforts to find and bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these barbaric acts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council also calls on the international community to support the Government of Iraq in exercising its responsibility in providing protection to the diplomatic community in Iraq, United Nations staff and other foreign civilian personnel working in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council also underlines the importance of continuing the efforts of the Government of Iraq and the Multinational Force in combating terrorism and improving security in Iraq in line with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1546(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1546 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1637(2005).pdf" class="pdf">1637 (2005)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates the importance of efforts to promote national reconciliation, dialogue and inclusion in ensuring peace, security and stability in Iraq, and in that context commends the Iraqi Government for initiating the Reconciliation and National Dialogue Plan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council reaffirms the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-29.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/29</a>.</p>
