	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">At the outset of this meeting, I should like, on behalf of the Security Council, to extend deep sympathy to the Government and people of the United States of America in connection with the terrible tragedy it has experienced as a result of the plane crash in Croatia yesterday, which claimed the lives of 33 persons, including that of the Secretary of Commerce, the Honourable Mr. Ronald H. Brown. I request the representative of the United States of America to convey to his Government and to the bereaved families our deep condolences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">In saying this, I am merely repeating publicly and officially what we all said in the consultations room, especially as their visit was a mission relating to the very subject of the statement the Council will issue at this meeting: the transition from war to economic reconstruction, from a break in relations to the building of peace and the creation of a better future for the people. I say to the representative of the United States that we deeply regret this terrible tragedy that has befallen us.</p>

I am sure I speak for all members of the Security Council in expressing appreciation to Ambassador Legwaila for the great diplomatic skill with which he conducted the Council's business last month.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Again, I echo words spoken in the consultations room in praising Ambassador Legwaila for his sense of humour and for the humanity with which he addressed subjects that were sometimes complex. I also thank the Botswana Mission for the constant and exceptional utility of its contribution.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1996-210.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/210</a>*, which contains the report of the Secretary-General pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1035(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1035 (1995)</a>, and <a href="../pdf/S-1996-190.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/190</a>, containing the text of a letter dated 13 March 1996 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the report of the High Representative for the Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the following other documents: <a href="../pdf/S-1996-215.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/215</a>, letter dated 22 March 1996 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, conveying a communication from the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to which is attached the fourth report on the operations of the Implementation Force (IFOR); and <a href="../pdf/S-1996-220.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/220</a>, letter dated 26 March 1996 from the representatives of France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America addressed to the Secretary-General, transmitting the text of the Final Document of the Contact Group Ministerial Meeting, dated 23 March 1996.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa04">Members of the Council have received photocopies of a letter dated 4 April 1996 from the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, which will be issued as <a href="../pdf/S-1996-242.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/242</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa05">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General of 29 March 1996 (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-210.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/210</a>*) submitted pursuant to its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1035(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1035 (1995)</a> of 21 December 1995, and the report of the High Representative for the Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed to the letter from the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council of 13 March 1996 (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-190.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/190</a>). The Council welcomes both reports.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa07">"The Security Council notes that, on the whole, the implementation of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Annexes thereto (collectively the Peace Agreement, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-999.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/999</a>, annex) is proceeding according to the timetable established by this Agreement. It also notes, in general, satisfactory compliance with the military aspects of the Peace Agreement as confirmed in the most recent report to the Council on IFOR operations (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-215.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/215</a>, annex and appendix) and stresses that now the main emphasis in implementation efforts by the international community and the Bosnian parties themselves should shift to the civil aspects of the Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa08">"The Security Council stresses that the responsibility for implementing the Peace Agreement rests primarily with the parties to that Agreement. It demands that they fully implement the Peace Agreement, and demonstrate a genuine commitment to confidence and security building measures, regional arms control, reconciliation and the building of a common future. In that context, it demands that the parties comply fully, unconditionally and without any further delay with their commitments regarding the release of prisoners, implementation of the constitutional framework, withdrawal of foreign forces, ensuring freedom of movement, cooperation with the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, return of refugees, and respect for human rights and international humanitarian law. It calls upon the authorities concerned with the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to move forward vigorously on measures to strengthen that Federation and, to that end, to implement in full the Sarajevo Agreement concluded on 30 March 1996 (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-244.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/244</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa09">"The Security Council is particularly concerned at the failure to date by all parties to comply fully with the provisions of the Peace Agreement concerning the release of prisoners, in spite of the repeated commitments by the parties to do so. The Council stresses that the obligation to release the prisoners is unconditional. Failure to do so constitutes a serious case of non-compliance. In this context the Council affirms its support for the conclusions of the Contact Group Ministerial Meeting of 23 March 1996 (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-220.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/220</a>) and notes the readiness of the High Representative to propose measures to be taken against any party that fails to comply.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa10">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the High Representative, who is in charge of monitoring the implementation of the Peace Agreement and mobilizing and, as appropriate, giving guidance to, and coordinating the activities of, the civilian organizations and agencies involved, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1031(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1031 (1995)</a>. It also expresses its full support for the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH), and other international institutions and organizations involved in the implementation of the Peace Agreement. It affirms that the implementation of the Peace Agreement must be strict, just, and impartial.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa11">"The Security Council expresses its strong support for the UNMIBH's International Police Task Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UN-IPTF). It notes that an effective United Nations civilian police operation is vital to the implementation of the Peace Agreement and encourages the UN-IPTF to implement its mandate as actively as possible, consistent with Annex 11 of the Peace Agreement as referred to in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1035(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1035 (1995)</a>. The Council, bearing in mind the agreement of the parties in Annex 11 of the Peace Agreement not to impede the movement of the UN-IPTF personnel or in any way hinder, obstruct or delay UN-IPTF personnel in the performance of their responsibilities, calls upon the parties to allow UN-IPTF personnel immediate and complete access to any site, person, activity, proceeding, record, or other item or event in Bosnia and Herzegovina as the UN-IPTF may request. It notes with appreciation the participation of Member States in the staffing of the UN-IPTF and urges those Member States which have agreed to provide civilian police to dispatch expeditiously fully qualified personnel to enable the UN-IPTF to reach full deployment by mid-April. It encourages the UN-IPTF to accelerate the deployment of police monitors, consistent with maintaining their high quality. The Council also expresses its strong support for the Mine Action Centre of UNMIBH and encourages States to contribute to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa12">"The Security Council recognizes that economic reconstruction and rehabilitation throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina are key factors for the overall success of the peace implementation process, reconciliation and reintegration. These tasks require the political will of and consistent efforts by the Bosnian parties as well as substantial international assistance. The Council urges that priority be given to projects aimed at facilitating the process of reconciliation and the economic reintegration of the whole country. It notes with appreciation the resources that have already been made available in this respect. It calls upon States and international institutions to honour fully their commitments regarding economic and financial assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council recalls the relationship, as described in the London Conference, between the fulfilment by the parties of their commitments in the Peace Agreement and the readiness of the international community to commit financial resources for reconstruction and development. It affirms that it is the parties themselves that have the most important role in re-establishing the economy of their country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa13">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern over recent developments in the Sarajevo area which caused thousands of Bosnian Serb civilians to leave their homes. The Council calls on the parties to make greater efforts towards reconciliation and the reconstitution of a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic Sarajevo, as a city of Bosniacs, Serbs, Croats, and others, and as the capital and seat of the future common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It further calls on the parties to put in place additional measures to ensure security, freedom of movement and conditions for the return of people affected in Sarajevo and all other transferred areas. The Council calls on the parties to reverse the trend of population movements and partition efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina along ethnic lines.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa14">"The Security Council pays tribute to all those who have given their lives in the cause of peace in the former Yugoslavia and expresses its condolences to their families, including to the family of the Secretary of Commerce of the United States of America.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa15">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General and the High Representative to continue to keep the Council regularly informed on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and on the implementation of the Peace Agreement."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa16">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1996-15.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1996/15</a>.</p>
