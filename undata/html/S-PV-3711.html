	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Council will now proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the General Assembly, the draft of which has been prepared by the Secretariat. I wish to note that, in accordance with the decision taken in June 1993, the Council's report is being considered in a public meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the draft report of the Security Council to the General Assembly for the period 16 June 1995 to 15 June 1996, as circulated by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 5 November 1996, and corrigendum. I should like to express appreciation to the Secretariat for the work it has undertaken in preparing this factual report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I now call on the Director of the Security Council Affairs Division of the Secretariat to make an explanatory statement.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Bali</span> <span class="non-nation">Director of the Security Council Affairs Division</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">The draft annual report of the Security Council for the period 16 June 1995 to 15 June 1996, to be submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations in pursuance of paragraph 3 of Article 24 and paragraph 1 of Article 15 of the United Nations Charter, has been prepared by the Secretariat in line with the revised format agreed upon by the Security Council in 1974 and further revised in 1985, 1993, 1994 and 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">The present format of the draft report before the Council provides a useful guide to the activities of the Council in a concise manner. As requested by the Security Council and as in the case of the last report, it contains in its introduction more information about the work of each of the sanctions committees than previously.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">The draft report was circulated by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 5 November 1996 to the current members of the Security Council and also to the five members whose terms of office expired on 31 December 1995 -- that is, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Nigeria, Oman and Rwanda -- for review and comments, if any.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">A corrigendum prepared by the Secretariat has been circulated to the members of the Council. It sets out corrections of a technical nature and in one case -- that is, with respect to Chapter 25 -- adds a new paragraph to the draft report.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">May I take it that the draft report is adopted by the Council?</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">This decision will be reflected in a note by the President of the Security Council, to be issued as <a href="../pdf/S-1996-935.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/935</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">The Security Council has thus concluded its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
