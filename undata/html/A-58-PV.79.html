<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Anguiano Rodríguez</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">It is an honour for the delegation of Mexico to introduce, on behalf of the sponsors, the draft resolution on the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), which is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.30-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/L.30/Rev.1</a>. In addition to the countries listed in the version of the draft resolution that we are introducing today, Japan has joined the list of sponsors.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">With the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace, on 29 December 1996, the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca put an end to more than three decades of armed conflict in Guatemala. The Agreement was the result of a six-year negotiation process sponsored by the United Nations. Since that time, at the request of the parties, the United Nations, through MINUGUA, has played a fundamental role in the peace process: verifying compliance with the commitments arising from the Agreement. That role has been widely recognized by the parties to the agreements and by Guatemalan society as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">The draft resolution that we are introducing today takes note of the reports submitted under this item. In particular, it responds to the request of the Government of Guatemala and of that country's civil society that the Mission's mandate be extended for one more year, until the end of 2004, so that it can accompany the peace process during the first year of the mandate of the Government that will assume its duties in January.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">Among the draft resolution's new elements, I should like to highlight the appeal to those who will be elected on 28 December to support the peace agreements as State accords and to incorporate them into their governmental plans, in conformity with the commitment undertaken by the main political parties in July 2003. Also included is a reference to the meeting of the Consultative Group for Guatemala held in May 2003, in which all participants agreed that the peace agreements should remain the essential road map for Guatemala's development. In addition, there is a reference to the recent agreement to establish an office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala. That will lend continuity to the verification work carried out by MINUGUA, once the Mission's mandate has been completed.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">As already indicated, with the adoption of this draft resolution, the Assembly will authorize a final renewal of the Mission's mandate from 1 January to 31 December 2004, in conformity with the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's report. In addition, we request the Secretary-General to submit to the fifty-ninth session of the Assembly a report on the implementation of the resolution and a final report on the Mission's work.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa06">I wish to indicate an editorial correction to the English version of the draft resolution under consideration. So that it is consistent with the English version recorded on behalf of the sponsors, in operative paragraphs 2 and 12 of the text, the words "with satisfaction" after the word "welcomes" must be deleted.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa07">Guatemala is now in a time of political transition in which the international community's support, through the Mission, remains very important. We trust that the political forces and Guatemalan society as a whole will maintain their commitment to the peace agreements and will commit themselves to completing the tasks remaining in the implementation of those agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa08">In this, which will be the final extension of the mandate of the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala, we hope that draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.30-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/58/L.30/Rev.1</a> will have the Assembly's unanimous support.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Omura</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa01">The Japanese delegation would like to provide an explanation regarding my Government's support of the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.30-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/L.30/Rev.1</a>, entitled "United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala". Japan believes that continued support for and strengthening of cooperation with the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) are critical for the enhancement of cooperation relations with Guatemala and with the Central American region as a whole, and has decided to sponsor this draft resolution to extend its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">At the same time, my delegation would like to stress that, while the extension of this Mission will not immediately result in an increase in the United Nations budget, we are generally quite concerned about the budget's continuing expansion. It is essential that, from this point forward, MINUGUA strive to accelerate its activities and to bring its final mandate to a conclusion expeditiously through closer coordination with the United Nations Development Programme and with other relevant organs of the United Nations system that are conducting activities on the ground.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tekin</span> <span class="nation">Turkey</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa01">Turkey will vote against the draft resolution entitled "Oceans and the law of the sea", contained in <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.19.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/L.19</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa02">The reason for my delegation's negative vote is that some of the elements contained in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea that had prevented Turkey from approving the Convention are once again retained in this year's draft resolution. Turkey supports the international efforts to establish a regime of the sea that is based on the principle of equity and that can be acceptable to all States. However, the Convention does not make adequate provision for special geographical situations and, as a consequence, is not able to establish an acceptable balance between conflicting interests. Furthermore, the Convention makes no provision for registering reservations on specific clauses.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa03">Although we agree with the Convention in its general intent and most of its provisions, we are unable to become a party to it because of those serious shortcomings. That being the case, we cannot support the draft resolution, which calls upon States to become parties to the Convention on the Law of the Sea and to harmonize their national legislation with its provisions.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa02">The delegation of Venezuela wishes once again to place on record its commitment to supporting, as it has always done in the past, efforts to promote coordination and cooperation with respect to oceans and the law of the sea. However, the difficulties that have prevented my country from becoming a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea remain unchanged and in effect, despite the fact that the Convention entered into force more than two decades ago. Its standards therefore do not apply to Venezuela, since my country is not a party to that international instrument.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa03">That is why my delegation wishes once again to place on record the fact that, for the reasons I have just noted, certain aspects of the draft resolution on the Convention on the Law of the Sea, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.19.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/L.19</a> under agenda item 52 (a), will compel us to abstain in the imminent voting.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Alarcón</span> <span class="nation">Costa Rica</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">With respect to the resolution on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations that has just been adopted, I would like to thank all delegations that participated, with generosity and in good faith, in the negotiations leading to the more appropriate distribution of the assessments.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">As all delegations know, the methodology adopted in 2000 for application over the following three years, created significant distortions that were detrimental to certain countries, particularly developing countries. Unfortunately, the methodology that is in place does not produce fair or equitable results. Costa Rica, together with 14 other nations, experienced an increase in its assessment of more than 50 per cent. The negotiations on the scale of assessments made it possible to reduce the negative impact of the methodology, thanks to the voluntary increase agreed to by the Russian Federation, as well as to bilateral agreements between some of the worst-affected States and others that were interested in resolving this unjust situation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">Costa Rica would like to thank the Government and the people of Spain for their solidarity and generosity. Thanks to them, the increase in my country's assessment during the forthcoming period will be more reasonable -- although it will still be significant. My delegation will never forget the noble and visionary initiative of the Spanish people.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">The difficulties we faced this year in negotiating the scale of assessments made it clear that we need to undertake an in-depth review of the methodology leading to a sound, fair and equitable calculation that is independent of political considerations. My delegation is prepared to start working to ensure that in 2006 we can adopt a new and better methodology. Likewise, we must provide the Committee on Contributions with clear technical, non-political criteria so as to enable it to evaluate the situation of each of the Member States with greater objectivity and with justice.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ramlal</span> <span class="nation">Trinidad and Tobago</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa01">During my delegation's statement during the meeting of the Fifth Committee on 15 October on agenda item 124, "Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations", we emphasized four issues, which we viewed as critical to our deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa02">First, we made clear our unswerving commitment to abide by the agreements contained in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-5.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/5</a> B, of 23 December 2000, which, among other things, fixed the elements of the scale methodology for two trienniums, namely, 2001-2003 and 2004-2006. Secondly, we emphasized the need for greater political commitment on the part of all Member States to pay their assessed contributions in full, on time and without conditions. Thirdly, we also emphasized the need for the General Assembly to extend sympathetic understanding to those who may be temporarily unable to meet their financial obligations because of genuine economic difficulties. Fourthly, we stressed that, consistent with the technical and political considerations inherent in the scale of assessments, due consideration would be given by the Assembly to ensuring adherence to the fundamental principles and processes which have guided the Assembly over the past 50 years in its deliberations on the scale of assessments.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa03">One of these long-standing principles has been the evolutionary nature of the scale methodology and the related need to ensure that there are no substantial increases in the individual rates of assessments of Member States over successive scale periods. Accordingly, in the context of negotiations on the draft resolution on the scale of assessments, Trinidad and Tobago sought to ensure full adherence to all the agreements contained in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-5.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/5</a> B, as well as to those principles which have guided the Assembly on this agenda item. We are pleased to have been a part of a consensus resolution on this important agenda item. We would also like to take this opportunity to place on record our appreciation to those delegations whose goodwill facilitated a decision on this agenda item, particularly the Government of Spain.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Goycochea</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa01">My delegation went along with the adoption without a vote of the draft resolution on the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, despite our reservations about a number of its provisions. Although my delegation understands that a budget resolution should not become an extensive policy document, we believe that it should include a number of provisions that put financial decisions in context. Therefore, we think a resolution text such as this, negotiated under exceptional circumstances, is inherently exceptional and should not be a precedent for future resolutions. That is without prejudice to the merits of the resolution just adopted, which are recognized by all delegations. In that context, my delegation would like to thank the Deputy Permanent Representative of Pakistan for his extraordinary efforts to arrive at this outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa02">My delegation notes that the resolution once again imposes budgetary cuts on the amount of resources requested by the Secretary-General. We believe that everyone's commitment to the Organization should include unrestricted support for reform measures and should be reflected in consistent and unconditional support for the budgetary requests that enable the Organization to function smoothly. That would be more coherent.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa03">The Cuban delegation is also concerned that the draft resolution has been used to promote certain reform decisions in the absence of specific decisions on the part of the relevant legislative bodies. It is in that context that we express serious reservations about the approval of the four posts requested by the Secretary-General in <a href="../pdf/A-58-569.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/569</a> for section 24, "Human rights", related to the implementation of measures 3 and 4 of his reform plan. Although Cuba accepted the establishment of those posts, showing great flexibility, we have serious questions about them, in that their establishment constitutes a violation of paragraphs 8 and 9 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-300.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 57/300</a>. We shall carry out the necessary follow-up on this issue once the relevant legislative bodies have indicated their position.</p>

In accordance with Article 17 of the Charter of the United Nations, Member States are not responsible for expenses related to such treaty body activities. However, in the context of our overall deliberations on the 2004-2005 budget and in keeping with our position that -- in accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 41/213</a> -- the budget should be adopted by consensus, the United States has not blocked provision for several allocations from the contingency fund, but we shall continue to oppose such expenditures.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa01">It is now my pleasure to speak the words that, I am confident, we all want to hear: we have concluded our work for the first part of the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Given the challenges we faced at the beginning and throughout the session, what we have been able to achieve together and the ambitious agenda we have set for ourselves for the remainder of the session, I believe it is safe to say that this session thus far has been nothing short of extraordinary.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa02">We started this session with a most dynamic and substantive general debate. The overall policy direction provided by the record number of heads of State or Government and other high-level participants in the general debate underpinned and stimulated the work of the Main Committees and of subsidiary bodies. Therefore, we were better prepared to address the myriad critical issues on our agenda, including HIV/AIDS, financing for development, humanitarian assistance, an enhanced role for the General Committee and the revitalization of the General Assembly itself.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa03">I was personally very optimistic at the beginning of this session that we were ready to move decisively to advance the process of revitalizing the General Assembly. I was ever conscious of the impact that a revitalized Assembly could have on the status of the United Nations in the global community. I am pleased that my reading of the readiness of Member States to move in that direction was right and that we have begun, with the adoption of a consensus resolution, a process for strengthening and revitalizing the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa04">On all the issues it has addressed thus far in this session, the General Assembly has put its shoulders to the wheel to accomplish the tasks at hand. We all know that it was not easy, and in fact at times it was exceptionally difficult. But each of our steps forward spoke volumes about our determination to reach accommodation, even when the challenges seemed intractable. I believe we have thus earned the right to be highly satisfied with our accomplishments.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa05">In particular, I am deeply appreciative of the support you have all provided in completing our work and the support you have given to me personally. In so doing, you have lightened my significant task. What we have accomplished redounds to the benefit of the General Assembly, of the United Nations and, consequently, of the various national constituencies that make up our global community.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa06">I want especially to express my heartfelt thanks to Permanent Representatives, delegates, chairpersons and members of regional and interest groups, and facilitators for the tremendous cooperation and support they have given me during this first part of the session. I look forward to their continued cooperation and support in the remainder of the session.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa07">The support of the Secretariat is integral to our collective effort to accomplish the goals and objectives of the General Assembly. I am especially indebted to the Under-Secretary-General and officers of the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management, who have spared no effort in assisting me and my Cabinet in every aspect of our work.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa08">The forthcoming period will be a demanding one, filled with challenge and great opportunity. We have laid out a very demanding agenda for what remains to be done during the rest of the session. On revitalization alone, our consensus resolution commits us to take up four key issues: the scheduling of future General Assembly sessions, including the work of the Main Committees and subsidiary and related bodies; the rationalization of the Assembly's agenda; the biennialization, triennialization, clustering and elimination of items; and the rationalization of the working methods of the Main Committees. As members are well aware, revitalization is but one of the myriad issues to which we must turn our attention. Others, including planning and preparation for the major events of 2005, will also have to be taken up with the greatest of resolve.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa09">I have some good news: we will resume in January 2004. Technically speaking, that is next year, and we have all earned the right to rest, relaxation and recreation in the interim. I also have some not-so-good news: January 2004 is but a mere nine days away. Notwithstanding that fact, I hope that we will all be back in January, energized and, indeed, revitalized and ready to contribute to the fullest to the implementation of the courses of action on which we have agreed.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa10">On that note, I wish all delegations and their families a wonderful holiday season and a successful and very happy New Year.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk07-pa11">I am now pleased to declare this part of the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly closed. I will ask members of the Assembly to join me in standing and giving ourselves a round of applause.</p>
