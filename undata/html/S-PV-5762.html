<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2007-576.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2007/576</a>, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on developments in Guinea-Bissau and on the activities of the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council, recalling its previous statements on Guinea-Bissau, and having considered the latest report of the Secretary-General on developments in Guinea-Bissau and on the activities of the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau (<a href="../pdf/S-2007-576.pdf" class="pdf">S/2007/576</a>), reaffirms its support for the continuing efforts to consolidate peace in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council notes with deep concern the threat posed by drug and human trafficking which can undermine the important gains made with respect to rule of law and to democratic and transparent governance. The Council further notes that the danger posed by drug trafficking in Guinea-Bissau could have negative implications towards the region as well as other regions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council is especially concerned over the security and safety of Bissau-Guinean officials involved in combating drug trafficking and organized crime. The Security Council therefore calls upon the Government with appropriate support from the international community to take concerted action to safeguard the safety and security of those officials who are involved in combating these activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the decision by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to convene later this year a regional conference on combating drug trafficking, aimed at developing a regional plan of action to deal with this challenge. The Security Council calls for urgent consideration of how the United Nations system might improve its support for Guinea-Bissau's fight against international drug trafficking and organized crime. The Security Council recognizes the importance of containing and reversing the threat of drug trafficking to the peace consolidation process in Guinea-Bissau. The Security Council further recognizes in particular the important role of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The Council requests the Secretary-General to report on this matter as soon as practicable. The Council further welcomes the initiative to hold an international conference in Lisbon, Portugal on drug trafficking in Guinea-Bissau in December 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council also expresses its concern with the fragility of the democratization process in Guinea-Bissau as well as persistent economic and social crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council welcomes the scheduled convening of legislative elections in 2008 and calls on all segments of Bissau-Guinean society to ensure that the elections take place in a peaceful and orderly fashion. The Council further appeals to the international community to provide the necessary logistical and technical support to ensure the effective and timely organization of the polls.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council further welcomes the improved dialogue between the Government of Guinea-Bissau and the Bretton Wood institutions and urges the Government to continue to implement its commitments in the areas of fiscal responsibility, reforms of the justice sector and good governance. The Council also welcomes the assistance provided to Guinea-Bissau by bilateral and multilateral partners, in particular the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the European Union and the World Bank, and encourages their enhanced constructive involvement in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council encourages the authorities of Guinea-Bissau to carry out their commitment concerning security sector reform. The Council also takes note of the announcement made by the European Union and ECOWAS to make resources available in support of security sector reform.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council recognizes the importance of a holistic approach in resolving the complex and multidimensional situation facing Guinea-Bissau and requests the Secretary-General to present proposals on how best the United Nations could provide effective assistance in an integrated and holistic manner to national efforts in order to contribute to the sustainable stabilization of Guinea-Bissau.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council takes note of the letter from the Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau requesting that Guinea-Bissau be placed on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission and expresses its intent to consider the request as a matter of priority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council reaffirms that peace and stability in Guinea-Bissau are critical for peace and security in the West African subregion. The Council recognizes the importance of the regional dimension in the resolution of the problems faced by Guinea-Bissau and in this regard welcomes the role being played by the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) in the peacebuilding process in Guinea-Bissau.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">"The Security Council recognizes and commends the important role played by the Representative of the Secretary-General and the staff of the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNOGBIS), as well as the United Nations country team, towards helping consolidate peace, democracy and the rule of law, and expresses its appreciation for the activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">"The Security Council will keep the situation in Guinea-Bissau under active review."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-38.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/38</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
