	Mr. Hoey (Ireland)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa01">I have the honour to make this statement on behalf of the European Union. The following associated countries -- Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Slovenia -- align themselves with this statement. Iceland and Liechtenstein also align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa02">The European Union is pleased to have been able to support the adoption of this draft decision by the General Assembly, taking note of the report of the High-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session and extending the work of the High-level Group into the fifty-first session. The European Union has consistently made clear that it attaches the highest importance to the work of the High-level Group and to its efforts to achieve a comprehensive, consensus solution to the financial difficulties confronting the Organization. At this stage, the European Union would like to pay special tribute to the Co-Vice-Chairs of the Group, Ambassador Annette des Iles of Trinidad and Tobago and Ambassador Ernst Sucharipa of Austria, for their tireless and dedicated efforts in furthering the work of the Group and trying to bring it to a successful conclusion.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa03">In welcoming the decision to extend the work of the High-level Group into the fifty-first session, the European Union also has to express its regret that, after almost two years of work, it has still not proved possible for the Group to agree upon any concrete measures for ameliorating the financial situation of the Organization -- this despite the clear urgency of the situation. At the end of August Member States owed $2.9 billion in unpaid assessed contributions to the Organization, while, at the same time, troop contributors, including member States of the European Union, which are collectively the largest financial contributor to the United Nations regular and peacekeeping budgets, and those who are associated with this statement, were owed more than $1 billion. The failure to achieve any substantial progress during the fiftieth session is disappointing compared with the widespread recognition at the fiftieth anniversary Special Commemorative Meeting of the General Assembly of the urgent need for Member States to reach an agreement which will secure a sound financial basis for the Organization and strengthen the United Nations capacity to fulfil its vital tasks.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa04">At the same time, the European Union is encouraged by the exchange of ideas and presentation of proposals on behalf of the vast majority of Member States which characterized the work of the High-level Group during the fiftieth session. The European Union believes that considerable common ground is now evident on many of the key issues confronting the Group. In our view, the stage has now been set for a productive and, indeed, decisive stage of the High-level Group's work, with Member States working to reach agreement on those key elements which must form the basis for comprehensive financial reform.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa05">I would now like very briefly to recall the main elements of the proposal put forward by the European Union last January for tackling the financial situation. We believe that the solution to the financial crisis must include various closely interlinked elements -- first and foremost, a commitment by all those in arrears to pay what they owe and in future to honour their financial obligations on time, in full and without conditions. The European Union has already indicated that in expecting those concerned to clear their arrears, some account should be taken of those Member States with genuine payment difficulties.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa06">Secondly, a system of incentives and disincentives should be implemented to ensure that Member States in future observe their legal obligation to make payments in full, on time and without conditions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa07">The third element of any solution must be a reform of the scale of assessments in order to produce a scale whose calculation is simpler, fairer and more transparent and which better reflects the principle of "capacity to pay". For the European Union, that principle must remain the primary measure of the level of each Member State's contribution to the United Nations. Any reform of the scale must aim at ensuring as close a relationship as possible between Member States' contributions and their actual capacity to pay, and at the same time give adequate consideration to the needs of countries with low per capita income. In parallel with financial reform, the European Union believes it is necessary to carry out a general streamlining of the United Nations system in order to make it more efficient and cost-effective.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa08">The European Union also wishes to reiterate that to resolve the United Nations financial difficulties what is required is a balanced and comprehensive package in which all aspects of the problem are adequately addressed. The European Union believes that its proposals remain the best basis for a negotiated solution that can command the support of all Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa09">The European Union stands ready to continue participating constructively in the work of the High-level Group and looks forward to an early resumption of its activities during the fifty-first session. In this regard, we have already indicated that we think it could be useful to hold, at an appropriate time, an orientation debate on the financial situation of the United Nations in plenary meeting of the General Assembly, in order to give a political impulse to the resumption of the High-level Group's work in January 1997.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa10">In conclusion, we would urge all Member States to build both on the progress achieved to date in the High-level Working Group and on the commitment evident at the fiftieth-anniversary Special Commemorative Meeting of the General Assembly, with a view to intensifying efforts to arrive at a comprehensive agreement during the course of the fifty-first session. Only in this way will we be able to safeguard the financial future and well-being of this Organization as we approach the new millennium.</div>

</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk06-pa01">On behalf of my delegation, Sir, I congratulate you sincerely on the terrific job you have done as President of the General Assembly. Under your skilful leadership, the Organization, which is going through times that are not of the best, has gained a significant credit of trust on the part of Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk06-pa02">The delegation of Ukraine credits you, as Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation On and Increase In the Membership of the Security Council and Related Matters, along with your brave co-Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador Breitenstein of Finland and Ambassador Jayanama of Thailand, with the first real success in the work of our Working Group. This year, our delegations, after long months of sometimes heated discussions, have reached a convergence of views on the content of the Group's discussions during the fiftieth session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk06-pa03">While evaluating the work of the Group positively, my delegation was among the last to drop its opposition to the content of the report. In our view, the conclusion of the Group as presented in paragraph 23 lacks impartiality and balance, reflecting only one part of the truth and not mentioning the other. The delegation of Ukraine is deeply concerned by the fact that logic and common sense are still rare guests during the discussions of our Group. My delegation strongly believes that deliberate attempts not to take notice of the legitimate interests of all Member States from all regions and groups can be, and are, detrimental to the goal of our exercise.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk06-pa04">As far as paragraph 23 of document <a href="../pdf/A-50-47.pdf">A/50/47</a> is concerned, my delegation decided to drop its objections in the spirit of compromise, having had a positive response to the Eastern European group interpretation on the part of other countries. At the same time, the delegation of Ukraine will continue to insist during the future work of the Working Group on explicit recognition of the significant increase in the number of members of the Eastern European regional group in the context of the expansion of the Security Council and the overall equitable geographical distribution of all regions in that important body.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk06-pa05">My delegation also wishes to recall that it will be in a position to support the reform of the Security Council, specifically its expansion, only if the representation of all regional groups, including the Eastern European group, is increased.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk06-pa06">My delegation would like to assure you, Sir, and your successor that it will be the last to cease its attempts to lead the Working Group to the successful end of its work.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa01">I have the honour to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Group of 77 and China regarding the adoption by the Assembly at its fiftieth session of the report of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa02">In this regard, allow me to make the following comments. As indicated in the report contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-50-45.pdf">A/50/45</a>, the Working Group on an Agenda for Development recommends that the work of elaborating the document on the Agenda should continue during the fifty-first session of the General Assembly, with the understanding that all efforts should be focused on concluding this exercise during the coming session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa03">The Group of 77 and China would like to express its support for this decision and its commitment to work actively and constructively in the coming sessions of the Working Group. However, we wish to reiterate that it is important that the quality and substance of the document must not be sacrificed because of deadline pressure. Otherwise, we run the risk that the goal of the negotiating process will be to meet the deadlines set rather than to develop a document that can make a substantial and real contribution to an Agenda for Development and to the promotion of effective international cooperation for development. At the same time, it is fitting to appeal to our counterparts in the developed countries to adopt a more open, flexible and cooperative approach to the concerns and aspirations of the developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa04">When this decision is adopted, several months will remain before the Working Group on an Agenda for Development meets again. This time should serve as a period for reflection and substantive analysis of the present state of negotiations and of the substantive basis of the document, in the light of the status of the text at the end of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. We should remember that the development process of our peoples cannot be halted; it demands a serious, comprehensive and permanent solution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa05">In this regard, allow me to make the following recommendations, which are intended as suggestions for consideration during this inter-sessional period of the Working Group on an Agenda for Development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa06">In the first place, it would be of great importance during this inter-sessional period to consider the possibility that the document on an Agenda for Development could benefit from a significant analysis by and substantive inputs from the South Centre, the regional commissions, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Secretariat, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and other institutions and agencies of the United Nations system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa07">Secondly, once a reasonable amount of time for reflection has elapsed and these inputs have been received, the creation of a core group by the presidency of the General Assembly could be considered in order to analyse these contributions and to prepare additional texts and new bases for negotiation to be examined at the next session of the Working Group, all with a view to strengthening both the substantive content of the document and the negotiating process. It is our view, given the political erosion in the elaboration of the Agenda for Development and the lack of a serious commitment to obtaining consensus language in the negotiations, that this important contribution of ideas and new perspectives regarding work and negotiation would be of value.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa08">Another important issue that needs to be addressed seriously is the possible future functions of the Working Group once an Agenda for Development is elaborated and adopted. It is the view of the Group of 77 and China that this important forum should remain open, and under no circumstance should the Working Group not be employed as a mechanism for follow-up, review and assessment of the implementation of the Agenda and the fulfilment of the commitments agreed therein. We consider this viewpoint of fundamental importance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa09">The reasons are clear. We cannot imagine the United Nations without an Agenda for Development. For the Group of 77 and China it would be unacceptable for the United Nations -- the only international Organization with universal membership, with a broad political mandate and an unequalled capacity to analyse, to call meetings and to take decisions, and with its large number of programmes and associated agencies in the social, economic, humanitarian and peacekeeping fields -- not to have, at the same time, a comprehensive and integrated programme of action for the development of the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa10">If the question of development and international cooperation were to be eliminated from the agenda of the United Nations, or if its importance and consideration were to be reduced or limited, this global Organization would lose a major part of its <i>raison d'être </i>and would lose sight of its objective of contributing to the solution of problems of vital importance to the international community. In this regard, the position of the Group of 77 and China is clear and decisive. Since its establishment in 1945, the United Nations has evolved not only in the firm determination, to maintain international peace and security, but also with the primary and fundamental objective of promoting the necessary conditions for the social and economic development of the world's less-advanced people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa11">Unfortunately, the Working Group established with the objective of elaborating an Agenda for Development has not been able to complete its work during the fiftieth session of the General Assembly or finalize the negotiations on a substantive document that not only addresses the legitimate aspirations and needs of the developing countries, but also gives consideration to the integrated follow-up of the agreements and programmes of action agreed upon at the highest political level at the international conferences and summits held under the auspices of the United Nations in the 1990s. In those agreements and programmes of action lies the real programme of work of the United Nations in such essential fields as the environment, natural disaster reduction, population, human rights, the rights of women and children, human settlements, and the future of cities and social development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa12">The Group of 77 and China will not yield in its commitment to adopting an Agenda for Development. We reiterate to the Assembly our unwavering commitment to keeping the issue of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of our countries on the negotiating table and on the agenda of the United Nations, as a priority issue as important as the issues of peace and international security. We shall never tire of expressing our view that economic and social development are essential elements without which peace and international security cannot be guaranteed, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa13">In this context, and with a very clear view of the conceptual framework and the importance of these negotiations, the Group of 77 and China is confident that we will be able to reach a successful conclusion of the deliberations on the adoption of an Agenda for Development at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa14">I do not wish to conclude without expressing our sincere and deep appreciation to the Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group on an Agenda for Development, His Excellency Mr. René Valéry Mongbé, Permanent Representative of Benin, and His Excellency Mr. Peter Osvald, Permanent Representative of Sweden to the United Nations. The Working Group had the honour and privilege of benefiting from the leadership and constant willingness to work of these two distinguished and esteemed diplomats. We recognize that much of the progress achieved was undoubtedly due to their personal commitment and to their invaluable initiative.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa15">The Group of 77 and China would also like to express its gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, Permanent Representative of Guyana to the United Nations, for his important contribution to the process of elaborating an Agenda for Development in his capacity as President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session, and for convening the world hearings on an Agenda for Development in 1994.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa16">Our sincere appreciation also goes to you, Mr. President, for your dedication and constant interest in the development of negotiations in the Working Group and, in general, for your leadership in promoting concrete results in the areas of reform and restructuring of the United Nations. We are indebted to you for your efforts and dedication, and I am especially pleased to express my appreciation here in one of the last meetings of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa17">Finally, I would like to express my deep and personal appreciation to all the members of the Group of 77 and China for their constant and invaluable support and advice during the long and complex negotiating sessions of this fiftieth session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk08-pa18">Together, and in unity, we shall continue the fight during the fifty-first session of the General Assembly until an Agenda for Development is finally adopted in the United Nations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa04">However, the European Union would also like to take this opportunity to express its serious regret that we have not yet reached agreement on an Agenda for Development. The concept of an Agenda for Development first saw the light of day in the Secretary-General's annual report on the work of the Organization presented in September 1992. Since then, we have addressed the matter several times in the Assembly, both by resolution and by decision, and in no fewer than seven very intensive negotiating sessions at the working group level.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa05">From the outset, the European Union has regarded these negotiations as providing an important and very welcome opportunity to build</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg006-bk01-pa06">"a new and adjusted framework for a new and improved partnership in development cooperation".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Dramatic and rapid changes are taking place in the field of international development cooperation -- especially with the increase in globalization, liberalization and interdependence -- which are having a direct impact on the societies of each Member State of the Organization, both developing and developed. In the view of the European Union, an Agenda for Development should address these issues in a global context to our mutual benefit and in a manner involving the Organization in the most relevant and effective manner. For this reason the European Union has to date played, and will continue to play, an active and leading role in all discussions and negotiations. In particular, the European Union has submitted several major proposals on negotiations in an Agenda for Development and has recently provided a range of amendments to the Vice-Chairmen's revised chapter III synthesis document of 17 May. The European Union wishes to reaffirm its commitment to arriving at an agreed Agenda for Development and to continuing its cooperation with all other delegations until this objective is achieved.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa08">Finally, with a view to concluding these negotiations successfully, the European Union firmly believes that they should take place within the discipline of an agreed deadline. The European Union therefore regrets that it was not possible to agree on such a deadline in the context of the decision before us. We hope nevertheless that our work can be finalized during the fifty-first session.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa02">The European Union wishes to thank you, Mr. President, as well as the two Co-Vice-Chairmen, for the skilful manner in which the Group's work has been guided and for your considerable efforts, which have resulted in the production of the report of the Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System, referred to in the draft decision to be adopted by the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa03">We believe that the report offers a good description of the proceedings of the Working Group over the past year and we are encouraged by what has been achieved to date. The Working Group's discussions have been thorough and constructive. The European Union welcomes the fact that much common ground is already apparent on many of the items which were discussed by the Working Group over the past year.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa04">We are pleased that the latest conference room paper, contained in document WGUNS/CRP.12, is attached as annex II to the report. We understand that this conference room paper will be the starting point for the renewed discussions which are to take place during the fifty-first session of the General Assembly. We recognize, of course, that there are difficulties still to be overcome in achieving a consensus on some of the important issues covered in annex II. Such questions, for which time was not available in the current session, have still to be dealt with; and there may be others. On the basis of the work so far, however, we are confident that the Working Group will maintain the required momentum and sense of purpose necessary to achieving a successful outcome.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk06-pa05">In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to assure you, Sir, of the European Union's commitment to continuing its cooperation with all delegations in order to carry forward the very useful progress which has been achieved by this Working Group to date. We attach great importance to the issues which the Group is considering and we look forward to seeing our deliberations yield concrete results in the forthcoming General Assembly session.</div>
