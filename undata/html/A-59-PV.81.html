	<div class="p">I wish on behalf of the Group of African States to express our profound sadness following the death of the President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency Mr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, on 5 February 2005. Allow me, on behalf of the Group, to convey our heartfelt condolences to the members of his family, to the people of Togo and to the friends of Togo on this immense loss. We share in their pain; we share in their sorrow.</div>
	<div class="p">President Eyadema will be greatly missed, not only by the people of Togo but also by those of the West African region and of the entire African continent. I pay tribute to his commitment to peace and stability in Togo, and especially to his very active role in conflict resolution in West Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">In memory of the late President Eyadema, the African Group appeals to the authorities in Togo to respect the legislation on succession in conformity with the constitution and to return the country to constitutional rule, in the interest of the Togolese people. We urge the people of Togo to exercise restraint and to organize elections without further delay. The African Group is convinced that the salvation of the country lies in respect for the constitution, the rule of law and free and fair elections.</div>
	<div class="p">I also take this opportunity to express the African Group's condolences following the accidental death of the Prime Minister of Georgia, His Excellency Mr. Zurab Zhvania. The late Prime Minister's death has robbed Georgia of a visionary leader who was the driving force behind the economic reforms which are under way in that country. I pay special tribute to his leadership and to his commitment to his people and to his country. We join the people of Georgia in mourning his death. He will be sorely missed by the people of Georgia.</div>
	<div class="p">The African Group expresses shock and dismay following the assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri. We condemn the perpetrators of that heinous act. The assassination of that great man puts at risk the peace and stability that Lebanon has enjoyed for the past 15 years. We pay tribute to Mr. Hariri for his dedication, for his commitment and for his leadership role in that country's reconstruction in the 1990s.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, I would like personally to pay tribute to a great friend and a dear colleague, the late Ambassador Sami Kronfol. Not only was he a great ambassador and a man of charisma and character, but he touched the lives of many in one way or another.</div>
	<div class="p">In tribute to the three men who have left us, we commit and rededicate ourselves to follow the good they have done. With respect to what has not been done, we look forward to all of us walking hand in hand to achieve their dreams.</div>

	<div class="p">On behalf of the Group of Asian States, which I have the honour to chair this month, I would like to convey our most heartfelt condolences to the family and to the people on the much lamented death of the President of the Togolese Republic, Gnassingbé Eyadema, who passed away on 5 February 2005.</div>
	<div class="p">The death of President Eyadema is a great loss for the States of West Africa and the African continent. He was one of the oldest rulers of Africa, having led Togo since 1967. During his tenure he worked to promote Togo's relations with other African States and the rest of the world and spared no effort to serve his country and to strengthen its position among African nations. He devoted his efforts to strengthening relations with members of the international community. We sincerely hope that the Togolese will take every measure possible to preserve stability and security within their country. We call upon all parties in the country to continue the policy of dialogue and responsibility to promote the values of peace and solidarity among themselves.</div>
	<div class="p">I also have the honour to convey, on behalf of the Asian Group, my deepest condolences to the Government and people of Georgia on the sad and sudden death of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania, who was only 41 years old. The sudden passing of the Prime Minister has caused all of us a deep sense of grief and sadness. Mr. Zhvania worked tirelessly for the progress of his country through the adoption of economic reforms to promote the role of Georgia and to strengthen its relations with the international community. Within a short period of flexible administration of Georgia's economy he managed to expand his country's relations with international financial institutions. The loss of Mr. Zhvania is a great loss for Georgia and the rest of the world.</div>
	<div class="p">I also wish to express the Asian Group's condolences to the family of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr. Rafik Hariri, and to the Government and people of Lebanon in this great loss, which has shocked us all. Prime Minister Hariri tried hard to reconstruct modern Lebanon. He was a great nationalist and a good example to be followed. He was a formidable politician and a moderate politician, a friend of all. It is a great loss for Lebanon, the Arab nation and the whole world. May God bless his soul.</div>
	<div class="p">I also have the honour to convey, on behalf of the Asian Group, our deepest condolences on the passing of brother Ambassador Sami Kronfol, Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations, to the Government and people of Lebanon and to our brothers in the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations on his much lamented death. We were all touched by his sudden passing away. He was a good friend to all of us. In the course of his work in the United Nations he forged many friendships. He was a brilliant diplomat, dedicated and talented, who served his country and its causes with the utmost dedication. The United Nations family has lost one of its most cherished diplomats, who will always be remembered for his friendly company. May the soul of Mr. Kronfol rest in peace.</div>

	<div class="p">It is my sad duty to convey to the Government and the people of Togo our most sincere condolences on the death of their leader, Mr. Gnassingbé Eyadema. The late President was one of the eminent world leaders who devote their lives to their people and to the achievement of the objectives of development and progress.</div>
	<div class="p">President Eyadema was one of the African leaders who made every effort to bring peace and progress to Africa and to develop relations between the countries of Africa and the entire world. We are convinced that the people of Togo will overcome this painful loss and continue the construction and development of Togo and that they will strengthen their role at the regional and international levels.</div>
	<div class="p">The death, in his prime, of the Prime Minister of Georgia was a huge loss to his people and to the international community. His death has left us with great sadness, as he worked tirelessly for the progress of his people and towards consolidating relations with the international community. In addition, he was able to strengthen the economic situation in Georgia. We express our profound condolences to his family and to the people of Georgia.</div>
	<div class="p">Lebanon has suffered a huge loss. A few days ago, terrorism, carried out by criminals, killed one of the symbols and leaders of Lebanon, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. His cruel death is not only a loss for Lebanon, but also a huge loss for all Arab countries. His policies were aimed at consolidating relations between Lebanon and the other members of the Arab Group. That was among the essential causes to which he devoted his efforts throughout a life marked by great accomplishments, including ending the civil war in Lebanon and rebuilding the country. We shall all feel the loss, in particular, my country, which loved him and which had strong ties of cooperation with him. On behalf of the Arab Group, I express our most sincere condolences to Lebanon and its fraternal people, as well as to Mr. Hariri's family. We hope that our brethren in Lebanon will continue the progress for which he worked.</div>
	<div class="p">On behalf of the Arab Group, we also express our condolences upon the loss of the Permanent Representative of Lebanon, Mr. Sami Kronfol. We have all worked with Ambassador Kronfol, who represented his country in an outstanding manner and who defended its cause in the United Nations and elsewhere. We could all sense his profound commitment and the sincerity of his efforts in all his activities. His time at the United Nations was brief, but he left a profound imprint reflecting the capabilities of Lebanese diplomacy. He always defended his country, his region and the world. With the passing of Mr. Kronfol, our loss is enormous. We have lost his outstanding professional capacities. He was highly intellectual, and was an expert in history, philosophy and science. I wish everyone could have had the opportunity to know this man, and to know his heart and its riches. We express our sincere condolences to the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations, to the Government of Lebanon and, above all, to Ambassador Kronfol's family. May God have mercy upon him.</div>

	<div class="p">It is with profound grief and great sorrow that we speak on behalf of the Government and the people of Togo during the General Assembly's tribute to the memory of President Gnassingbé Eyadema of Togo, Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania of Georgia and Ambassador Sami Kronfol of Lebanon, all of whom have left us.</div>
	<div class="p">First of all, we wish to express our heartfelt thanks to the President of the General Assembly, to the Secretary-General and to all Member States for their sincere expressions of condolence and their sympathy upon the cruel loss that struck the Togolese people with the passing of President Eyadema on 5 February 2005. Togo greatly appreciates the compassion shown by the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">As we all know, President Eyadema devoted his whole life to working tirelessly and relentlessly in the quest for peace, security and sustainable development. His many notable contributions to the restoration and promotion of peace wherever it was in danger -- particularly in Africa -- are well known. They proceeded from the late President's unfailing commitment to dialogue and consultation, which alone make it possible to resolve disputes -- whatever they may be -- in a sustainable manner.</div>
	<div class="p">A great architect of peace and dialogue, President Eyadema was also a fervent promoter of development: the best way to lift the peoples of our countries out of misery and poverty. Thus, he was at the forefront of the creation, in 1975, of the Economic Community of West African States, which -- as the Assembly is aware -- has set about in a remarkable way to resolve the crises and conflicts that unfortunately continue to shake the subregion.</div>
	<div class="p">In that context, President Eyadema appealed to the international community, at the Millennium Summit, held here in September 2000, to devote sustained attention to African States so that they could have the opportunity to make significant progress in the new global economy. Today, the initiatives that are materializing for the African continent -- particularly the British initiative of a "Marshall Plan" for Africa; the establishment of an African peace force, which was proposed at the summit of the Organization of African Unity held in Tunis in 1994; and many others -- can only serve to confirm the wisdom of the late President's views.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, we should like to express once again our most heartfelt condolences and deep sympathy to the Governments and the peoples of Georgia and Lebanon, who, like Togo, have lost one of their illustrious sons. We also wish to pay tribute to the memory of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, His Excellency Mr. Rafik Hariri, who was tragically assassinated yesterday.</div>
	<div class="p">May the eminent personalities whose memories we honour today rest in peace.</div>

The sorrow of the peoples of Togo and Lebanon is very close to the hearts of the Georgian people today, and we fully share their grief.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me also express, on behalf of the Government and the people of Georgia, sincere gratitude for the condolences and sympathy offered in connection with the tragic death of His Excellency Mr. Zurab Zhvania, Prime Minister of Georgia. Mr. Zhvania was not just a Prime Minister, but also a highly capable and important politician who had contributed immensely to the democratic development of my country for more than a decade, since its recent independence. He was truly an architect of modern-day Georgia. Even more, his leadership and vision made all friends of Georgia hopeful for the country's future as a democratic and prosperous nation.</div>
	<div class="p">The loss of Mr. Zhvania is irreparable for Georgia; a leader of such calibre does not emerge every day. Nevertheless, we are determined to continue on the path outlined in his vision for a democratic Georgia in order to make Mr. Zhvania's ideals a reality. That will be the best possible tribute to the memory of an outstanding statesman.</div>

Document <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/684">A/59/684</a> contains the curriculum vitae of the candidate nominated by national groups.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected.</div>
	<div class="p">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General Assembly are all 191 Member States. Accordingly, for the present election, 96 votes constitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly will now proceed to a secret ballot. If in the first ballot no candidate obtains an absolute majority, it will be necessary to proceed to further ballots until a candidate has obtained the required majority. Pursuant to the decision taken by the General Assembly at its 915th meeting, held on 16 November 1960, those ballots shall be unrestricted.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to the procedures I have just outlined?</div>

	<div class="p">As a result of the independent voting in the Security Council and in the General Assembly, Mr. Ronny Abraham has obtained an absolute majority in both bodies.
