	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1996-354.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/354</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 16 May 1996 from the Permanent Representative of Tajikistan to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the text of a letter dated 14 May 1996 from the President of the Republic of Tajikistan addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council condemns the recent violations of the Tehran cease-fire agreement of 17 September 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1102.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1102</a>, annex I), in particular the planned and organized offensive by the armed Tajik opposition in the Tavildara region. It strongly deplores the loss of life of civilians and of members of the CIS Collective Peace-keeping Forces as a result of acts of violence. It affirms that such acts are totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its grave concern that all such actions further aggravate the already serious humanitarian situation in Tajikistan. It demands the immediate cessation of the offensive actions and acts of violence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Tajikistan and to the inviolability of its borders.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council emphasizes its support for the extension of the cease-fire agreement for the whole duration of the inter-Tajik talks, and notes that the Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan (IRMT) has agreed to extend the cease-fire, albeit only for a further three months. It calls upon the parties to demonstrate their commitment to peace by strict compliance with the cease-fire and other obligations which they have assumed, as well as with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. It also reminds the parties that the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) is subject to the proviso that the cease-fire agreement remains in force and that the parties continue to be committed to an effective cease-fire, to national reconciliation and to the promotion of democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council commends the personnel of UNMOT for their contribution under difficult circumstances. It expresses its concern at the restrictions placed upon UNMOT by the parties and calls upon them, in particular the Government of Tajikistan, to ensure the safety and freedom of movement of the personnel of the United Nations and other international organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council calls upon both parties to resolve their differences over the functioning of the Joint Commission, including the issue of security guarantees for Commission members, and to recommence the operations of the Commission as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council is concerned that the worsening humanitarian situation makes it all the more urgent to obtain the required resources and calls upon Member States and others concerned to respond promptly in support of the humanitarian relief efforts of the United Nations and other international organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council invites the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to continue their efforts aimed at the earliest possible resumption of the inter-Tajik talks and calls upon the countries and regional organizations acting as observers at those talks to render all possible support to those efforts."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1996-25.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1996/25</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
