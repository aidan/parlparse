	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in the course of the Council's prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-375.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/375</a>, and the text of a letter dated 25 March 1994 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-361.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/361</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">&quot;The Security Council has received the Secretary-General's report on the observation by ONUSAL of the elections in El Salvador on 20 March 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-375.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/375</a>). It has also received the Secretary-General's letter of 28 March 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-361.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/361</a>) drawing to the attention of the Security Council his continuing concerns regarding problems in the implementation of the Peace Accords in El Salvador.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">&quot;The Security Council congratulates the people of El Salvador on the peaceful and historic elections</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">held on 20 March 1994. It notes that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General stated on 21 March 1994 that in general the elections on 20 March 1994 took place under appropriate conditions in terms of freedom, competitiveness and security and that, despite serious flaws regarding organization and transparency, the elections can be considered acceptable. The Security Council calls upon those concerned to take the necessary measures, as recommended by the Secretary-General, to correct those shortcomings which appeared in the first round and thus to guarantee a genuine and indisputable expression of the will of the people in the second round of the presidential elections on 24 April 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">&quot;The Security Council calls for the full implementation of the Peace Accords. It shares the concerns expressed by the Secretary-General that progress is still required regarding the implementation of the points highlighted in his letter of 28 March 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-361.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/361</a>), particularly in relation to public security, including the deployment of the new National Civil Police (PNC) and the phasing out of the National Police (PN); the reintegration into society through transfers of land and other programmes of estranged groups, including former combatants; and the constitutional reforms recommended by the Commission on the Truth, especially as they relate to the reform of the judiciary. The Security Council urges those concerned to make every effort to ensure that further delays in those areas are avoided and distortions corrected, so that the process can gain momentum, the provisions of the Peace Accords be duly implemented and the goals of the peace process be fully achieved.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-15.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/15</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
