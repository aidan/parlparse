The Council condemns that act of terrorism in the strongest possible terms. The members of the Council express their sympathy and condolences to the victims and their families and to the Government of the Russian Federation. On behalf of the Council, I should like to request the representative of the Russian Federation to convey those sentiments to his Government and people.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">On behalf of the Council, I extend a warm welcome to Ms. Ana Pessoa Pinto, Senior Minister and Minister in the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste and Head of Mission.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2004/333</a>, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a briefing by Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste and Head of Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">Before giving him the floor, I wish to welcome the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sharma, to the Security Council, where, as we all know, he has many friends.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">Special Representative of the Secretary-General Sharma has effectively overseen and managed a complex operation that has adjusted and adapted responsively to the changing situations on the ground and has successfully launched important peacekeeping innovations such as the United Nations executive role in policing and the provision of civilian advisers to the Government. Here in New York, the Security Council has benefited from an excellent flow of information and analyses from his office that has allowed us to follow closely developments within Timor-Leste and to make decisions as required.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">It is a pleasure to receive Mr. Kamalesh Sharma within this Chamber, which is tempered only by our regret that, as we understand, this will be our last opportunity to welcome him in this capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">On behalf of the members of the Council, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, for his contributions and to wish him every success in future.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">I give the floor to Mr. Sharma.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sharma</span> <span class="non-nation">Special Representative of the Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I wish to thank you, Sir, for your very kind words. I appreciate them very much. It is a pleasure for me that our consideration of this item is taking place under your presidency.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">I have the honour, as you have said, Sir, to present my final statement as Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste before the Security Council. I would like at the outset to thank members of the Council, who have been throughout appreciative and encouraging of our efforts towards assisting in the stability and self-reliance of Timor-Leste. This has been a great support for the entire team of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), whose contribution and commitment in implementing the Council's mandate I would also like to acknowledge here with deep appreciation. The contribution of some of them will carry on in the additional year of the consolidation phase, which proposal is before the Council, before the exceptional association of the United Nations with the newly independent State of Timor-Leste in the form of peacekeeping missions draws to a close. I am confident that, should the Council endorse the proposal, the team will show the necessary dedication during that phase and will give to my successor the support I have received.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">It is the plain truth that a United Nations mission cannot show consistently positive results unless there is close, constructive and continuous consultation and exchange based on trust with the leadership of the country. My experience has been notable and heartening in this respect, and I would like to place on record my grateful appreciation to the Government of Timor-Leste for the cooperative and forward-looking orientation and the spirit of joint striving which characterized our efforts. They constitute, I believe, a model of collaboration. Most importantly, of course, my gratitude goes to President Xanana Gusmão, Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, and President of the National Parliament Francisco Guterres "Lu-Olo" and Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta. Over two years, I maintained a pattern of weekly meetings with the Prime Minister and had very frequent meetings with the other leaders. They were at all times ready to receive me and offer their full cooperation and advice in furthering the mandate charged to us by the Council. In a complex and ambitious mandate, it is inevitable that there would be rough passages as well as smooth ones. We brought understanding to each other's tasks in negotiating the way ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">It is particularly appropriate that, as an exceptional gesture, we have Senior Minister Ana Pessoa participating in this meeting of the Council, which will be the last one under the current mandate. I have no doubt that the Council will profit greatly from the personal presence of Minister Ana Pessoa, and I would also like to thank her for the effort she has undertaken to participate in the meeting today.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">I would like to acknowledge with satisfaction the fact that the engagement of peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste is widely described as having been a successful one. I myself characterize the outcomes and result as encouraging. That is not because I have any reservations on the success of our engagement, but because we know from the experience of the last half century that for success to be embedded and durable, unremitting effort and belief in the highest values of democratic and participative governance have to be demonstrated over a long period. All too often, what had appeared a success story has turned sour. Success is a retrospective judgement that -- when we look back after decades and take satisfaction at the fact of a foundation so solidly laid, and a positive and enlightened direction of policy based on the rule of law and principles of transparency and accountability so firmly adhered to -- the national accomplishment can be regarded as irreversible and as a lasting achievement by the political class and the people.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">To ensure that outcome, which can be obtained only after much tenacity and effort, the primary imperative in a new nation is the dedication of the leadership to building and respecting institutions that reflect those values. In the formative years of an independent nation, it is essential that the leadership pursue a vision -- and advocate and advance principles in its political and administrative conduct and practices -- which will bear the judgement of history and succeeding generations. The scrutiny and evaluation of the direction and example given by the first leaders of any nation never slackens, as their example has to stand the test of time.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">The quality of governance and of the institutions of the State can be progressively built upon only if the foundations are strong. That is a responsibility of truly historic proportions which the first leaders carry on their shoulders, and it is appropriate that they should already see their actions and contributions in that historical perspective and not be guided only by fleeting or convenient considerations of the moment. That entails care to safeguard the means of policy and not only the ends. I believe this is a test which the first leadership of Timor-Leste is equipped to discharge to the lasting benefit of present and succeeding generations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">While enlightened leadership is the leading ingredient in the social and political success of a State, it is equally true that -- particularly in the context of a progressively interdependent world and the explosive rise in the expectations of all peoples -- the quality as well as the empathy of the engagement of the outside world, as development partners, particularly by countries of the neighbourhood and the economically better-endowed partners, are equally crucial. We have to ensure the strength of supportive partnerships. It is hoped that the nascent State of Timor-Leste, burdened by the trauma of history and among the States with the highest levels of poverty and the most depressed social indicators in the world, will benefit from the understanding and supportiveness of the outside world, which will assist it on the path to stability, increasing prosperity and the enhancement of the quality of life and choices for its people. This is a challenge which we cannot fail to meet. No lasting political or social gain can accrue without economic growth and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">The main developments of interest in the preceding half year have been reflected in report before the Council (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>), and I can therefore -- no doubt to everyone's relief -- compress what I have to say on the various elements of the mandate pertaining to external and internal security and support for public administration.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">The national police -- the Policia Nacional de Timor-Leste (PNTL) -- now bears responsibility for policing in all 13 districts and for a vast majority of headquarter functions. As stated in the report, we are confident about transferring executive responsibility for policing to Timor-Leste at a minute past midnight on 19 May. The contribution of Police Commissioner Sandra Peisley has been my strength in the performance of the mandated task of maintaining law and order and developing the PNTL as an effective force. While the Council should be reasonably satisfied with the development of PNTL capacities so far, the creation of a professional, apolitical, accountable and responsive police service, with well-established traditions of integrity and a mindset of service to the community, will take longer. The recent approval by the Council of Ministers of an Organic Law on the PNTL, the Organic Law on the Ministry of Interior and a disciplinary code for the PNTL are the essential first steps in that direction. I remain convinced that the Government of Timor-Leste will ensure effective utilization of the mentoring capacities to be provided by the 157 police officers proposed during the consolidation phase of UNMISET, in conjunction with other long-term bilateral and multilateral programmes for police development.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa11">The military component of UNMISET has continued to be downsized according to the revised schedule that was approved in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1473 (2003)</a>. Its presence over the past two years of UNMISET has been a factor promoting stability and the consolidation of a still fragile peace. On this occasion, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the three Force Commanders, General Winai Phattiyakul, General Tan Huck Gim and General Khairuddin Mat Yusof. Their dedication to their task, their ability to motivate the UNMISET military component and their advice and support to me have also been a great strength.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa12">At this time, I wish to draw the attention of the Council to the very useful and necessary work that the engineers in UNMISET's military component have been doing in maintaining the major arteries of the road system in Timor-Leste, which I have previously acknowledged. Without continued international support for that task, the capacity for rapid response to post-UNMISET security challenges would be rapidly degraded all over the country. It would also pose a host of challenges for continued economic development and would threaten fragmentation of essential social functions. Bilateral and multilateral assistance will play a crucial role in meeting that challenge.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa13">The efforts of both Indonesia and Timor-Leste to find a solution to the transitional issues, particularly those related to refugees and the demarcation of the land border, have been detailed in the report before the Council. I would like to place on record my deep appreciation of the accessibility and the encouragement from the leadership of Indonesia which I have enjoyed in the pursuit of the task of assisting on those transitional issues, which are part of UNMISET's mandate. It is to be expected that not all aspects of a developing bilateral relationship would be amenable to speedy resolution within a couple of years of the emergence of Timor-Leste as an independent State. However, I believe that considerable advances have been made in many directions, that structures of constructive cooperation have been created and employed and that the political signals at the highest levels from both States have been conducive to constructing a relationship of friendship, goodwill and cooperation, unburdened by history. We can look forward with high expectations to the future course of the relationship.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa14">Reports -- though unconfirmed -- of criminal elements, many of them armed, both inside and outside Timor-Leste, continue to be received. However, Indonesia's commitment to controlling such elements is encouraging, as are the continuing efforts of Timor-Leste to develop the capabilities of its security agencies to deal with such criminal elements, including through the establishment of a Rapid Deployment Service of the PNTL, which will operate in rural border areas. UNMISET would continue to cooperate with the Government of Timor-Leste in building the capacities of the specialized units of the PNTL, including the training of the rapid deployment service during the consolidation phase.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa15">Through its institution- and capacity-building activities, UNMISET has contributed significantly to the viability and political stability of the State institutions of Timor-Leste, including through mentoring and coaching Timorese counterparts, assistance in the preparation of legal frameworks, formalizing related rules and regulations and institutionalization of operational procedures.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa16">The innovative and pioneering experiment sanctioned by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1410 (2002)</a> revealed that the requirements for human and institutional capacity development were far more demanding than originally envisaged, requiring the presence of most critically important advisor positions beyond May 2004. A robust exit strategy to ensure sustainability will be the major challenge during the consolidation phase of the mission. Likewise, the assistance provided through the serious crimes programme of UNMISET offers crucial reinforcement to the Council's commitment that perpetrators of such crimes shall be brought to justice. It also helps to strengthen Timorese capacities in the justice sector.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa17">A healthy and functioning justice sector in Timor-Leste is crucial for the overall functioning of the democratic institutions and thus is fundamental in ensuring good governance. The recruitment of international judges to fill the current gaps would therefore be accorded priority attention. However, the sustainability of the justice sector can be achieved only through the direct support of bilateral and multilateral development partners. This must be not only an immediate priority, but also a much needed long-term strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa18">Social peace, security and stability are, of course, a prerequisite for sustainable gains in areas of governance and economic development. Enhanced transparency and accountability in governance provide a healthy tone to the political culture and also contribute to better and more effective utilization of external assistance. Through the Provedor, or ombudsman, Act and workshops in this area, in addition to the office of the Inspector General, the Government has signalled its commitment to these principles. Similarly, enhanced cooperation between the wider United Nations system of agencies, funds and programmes and international financial institutions, as well as bilateral actors and civil society, in support of national programmes would contribute towards a holistic approach. In that regard, I would like once again to acknowledge the sterling support given to me by Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Resident Coordinator Sukehiro Hasegawa.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa19">Being acutely conscious of the need for a smooth downsizing of the Mission, we had established a committee in good time to ensure that all elements for a proper handover to the Government, or other applicable means of disposal of assets, were in place. Since I last addressed the Council in October 2003, considerable progress has been made in the orderly downsizing of the Mission. Planning for what would have been the final repatriation of the peacekeeping force (PKF), the United Nations police and the substantive elements of the civilian staff had reached an advanced stage before it was overtaken by the planning for the much smaller follow-on mission now proposed. Much of the earlier work, however, remains relevant. The permanent PKF presences in Suai and Oecussi were withdrawn, and United Nations and contingent-owned equipment assets in those locations were largely recovered or donated to the Government of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa20">In keeping with our policy of handing back to the Government fully functional facilities where this is possible, two United Nations-owned facilities in Suai -- the former Sector West Headquarters and the PKF Forward Surgical Team hospital, complete with medical equipment -- were donated to the Government in December 2003. The Government has to meet the challenge of meeting the operational requirements. During liquidation, environmental considerations have been respected.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa21">The drawdown of United Nations police and the progressive handover of policing responsibility to the PNTL have been accompanied by the donation of United Nations-owned equipment in police stations. UNMISET continues to provide essential telephone services down to substation level, where Timor Telecom cannot provide this service, and provisionally full operation of the police VHF radio network. It appears that without some significant development in local capability, UNMISET will have little choice but to continue this support well into the period of the proposed follow-on mission.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa22">I am pleased to report that the downsizing of the national staff has not caused us any appreciable difficulty, largely due to the efforts of the Division of Administration, particularly its Director, Philip Cooper, to improve their job skills and to accord recognition through certificates of the experience gained by them while employed by the United Nations. Training courses have been run in software programmes -- Word, Excel, Access, Power Point -- computer hardware, web design, language training in English and Portuguese, office administration, small business development, proposal writing, formal documentation and the establishment of cooperatives and microfinance.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa23">These initiatives have been appreciated by the national staff. The return of the national staff's pension contributions within one month of the end of their contracts by the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund has also contributed positively to the morale of those staff. Expanding and new missions of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations have absorbed most of the international staff who have sought continued employment with the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa24">Before I conclude, let me express my deep thanks to the Secretariat, particularly Jean-Marie Guéhenno, Hédi Annabi, Julian Harston and the efficient desk officers assisting us in our work in the field, as well as their colleagues in other specialized units of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other departments of the Secretariat. Their availability, guidance and unfailing support have left an indelible impression on me.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Before opening the floor, I would like to say that, in accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I would like to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with longer statements are kindly requested to circulate a full text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when addressing the Council in this Chamber.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Konuzin</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">We are grateful to you, Sir, for expressing solidarity with Russia on behalf of the Security Council in connection with the terrorist attack on my country. I shall convey your words of sympathy to the Russian Federation and all the victims of the tragedy.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">Our Organization was established immediately after a most cruel and devastating war that brought mankind untold grief. Millions upon millions died and my own country suffered enormous loss of life. Yesterday was 9 May, a day sacred to the citizens of Russia and all peoples of the Soviet Union. On the very anniversary of victory in the great war for the fatherland, when countries in the anti-Hitler coalition and all people of good will commemorated the end of the Second World War, a monstrous terrorist act was committed in the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation. In Grozny, during the celebrations commemorating the crushing of fascism, a terrorist explosion killed the legally elected President of Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov. Others died and many, including children, were wounded.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">This crime was committed at a time when the Chechen Republic was gradually intensifying its efforts to restore a peaceful way of life. Refugees were returning home, the economy was recovering and political activity was increasing. It was precisely that -- the normalization of the situation in the Republic -- that drew the fury of terrorists who are blinded by hatred for all mankind and who are doomed to oblivion. Today, in every mosque in Chechnya, they are praying for the victims of this act of terrorism and cursing the murderers.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">The bloody trail of terrorism can be seen throughout the world: Russia, the United States, Indonesia, Spain, Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. International terrorism, the black plague of the twenty-first century, can be countered only if we work together and form the united front of an international anti-terrorist coalition. Russia will participate in that struggle. Victory will be ours.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">My delegation has prepared a draft presidential statement in connection with the terrorist attack in Grozny. May I ask you, Sir, to convene consultations following this meeting in order to consider it?</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">I now turn to the item on the Security Council's agenda today. We are grateful for the Secretary-General's report on Timor-Leste, containing detailed information on developments in that country. We believe that it accurately reflects both the achievements of and the main problems facing Timor-Leste. We agree with the report's conclusion concerning the need to extend the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) beyond 20 May for an additional 12-month consolidation phase, in a reduced size and with a modified mandate. We support the Secretary-General's suggestions for the parameters of an extended UNMISET, including the new recommendation for the establishment of an international response unit of 125 gendarmerie.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">We are grateful to Brazil for having prepared a draft resolution on the basis of the Secretary-General's recommendations and we are prepared to participate constructively towards its adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">We welcome the further stabilization in Timor-Leste and commend the Timor authorities on their success in developing the basic State institutions. We note the progress achieved in legislation with a view to the adoption of several important laws and regulations governing the activities of individual public bodies, determining procedures for local elections and regulating various aspects of social and political life in the country. We expect that Timor-Leste will soon adopt key laws on the national police and defence, which are essential to establishing a truly independent force to provide internal and external security for the country.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">We welcome the establishment of the National Electoral Commission, the first test of which will be the preparation of local elections in the last quarter of this year. We share the view that external assistance will be necessary to the successful holding of the elections and we urge the donor community to provide Timor-Leste with the support it needs for the preparation and convening of those elections.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">We welcome the ongoing development of Timorese-Indonesian relations. The two countries have expressed their desire to establish genuine good-neighbourly and mutually beneficial relations, which provides grounds for hope that there will soon be a settlement of pending matters, including the important issue of demarcating and monitoring the common border. Timor-Leste's economic development will also benefit from positive movement in bilateral talks with Australia on developing and allocating underwater petroleum resources.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">In conclusion, we thank Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for East Timor, and the entire UNMISET staff for their real contribution to a settlement on the island.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lucas</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I want to convey the condolences of the Angolan delegation to the Russian Government and to the families of the victims of yesterday's terrorist bomb attack in Grozny, Chechnya.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">We are grateful for the convening of this meeting on the situation in Timor-Leste. We welcome and thank Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for presenting the report on the activities of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET).</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">We welcome the participation in this meeting of the Security Council of Mrs. Ana Pessoa Pinto, Minister of State and Minister in the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of Timor-Leste. We also express our agreement with the statement that the representative of Brazil will deliver on behalf of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">We are gratified by the contents of the report portraying remarkable achievements by the Timorese people in building their country in such a short period of time. It is our belief that those achievements lay solid grounds for the further involvement and cooperation of the international community with Timor-Leste. My delegation reiterates Angola's commitment to the objectives set by the Timorese people and by the international community of establishing a truly self-sufficient State based on the rule of law, on respect for human rights and on democratic values.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The Secretary-General's report mentions important steps recently taken by the Timorese Government towards the consolidation of the Timorese State. Taking into account their structural impact, we deem of great importance the steps taken in preparation for the first elections and the legislative reforms associated with it; the adoption of legislation for key public institutions, such as the Superior Council of Defence and Security, the Interior Ministry and the national police; the addressing of serious crimes committed in 1999; and the continued strengthening of the institutions of political and public administration. We are encouraged by the very positive nation-building developments in Timor-Leste at a moment when the country has reached a dramatic threshold and when, with every passing day, the Timorese are assuming further responsibilities in the conduct of their own affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The political and institutional progress achieved by Timor-Leste over the past two years is impressive; it shows the great wisdom of the Timorese people and of its leadership. We note with appreciation the increased stability in the security situation in Timor-Leste. We fully share the Government's assessment of its limited ability to cope with internal and external security challenges. We further share the Secretary-General's conclusion, highlighted in his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>), that Timor needs more assistance from the international community in order to guarantee the consolidation and long-term sustainability of its administrative institutions, the rule of law and its territorial sovereignty.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">The emerging institutions -- principally the public administration, the justice sector and the national police -- are still fragile. We think that Timor-Leste will need the continued support of the United Nations and of the international community at large. The continued presence of UNMISET gives confidence to the Timorese people and contributes to the maintenance of security and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">My delegation acknowledges that this is a crucial moment in the history of Timor, and that the international community should be prepared to sustain the efforts it has been deploying in favour of Timor-Leste for quite some time, and in so doing to ensure the best possible conditions for the sustainability of the peace-building process in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">My delegation supports the recommendations set out in the report of the Secretary-General on the role, size and format of UNMISET and on key national support programmes. It is our belief that the revised multifunctional mandate of UNMISET, when fully implemented, will result in better functioning of national institutions, ensure the development of the rule of law, promote better security and stability and ensure a self-sustainable Timor-Leste. My delegation supports the extension of UNMISET's mandate for a further one-year consolidation phase and believes that decisions on the future presence of a United Nations mission should be taken in due time and in accordance with circumstances on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">The relations between Timor-Leste and its neighbours -- particularly Indonesia and Australia -- are an important factor in the situation in the country. We praise the commitment made by those two key countries to the future of Timor-Leste, the constructive dialogue they are undertaking on issues of mutual interest, in particular those concerning the demarcation and management of the common border. My delegation encourages bilateral donors to continue to provide timely and appropriate assistance for the consolidation of peace and the development of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, we commend the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, and UNMISET for the role they have played, and we reiterate our confidence that the Timorese will build a stable, prosperous and democratic society.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Duclos</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I too want to thank Mr. Kamalesh Sharma for his briefing; we are sorry that he is leaving his post.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">The Permanent Representative of Ireland will be making a statement on behalf of the European Union, with which my delegation fully associates itself.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Mr. President, you requested that we be as brief as possible, so I shall not repeat previous speakers' analysis, which reflected the fact that significant progress has been achieved in Timor-Leste and that that progress needs to be consolidated. Here, let me note that, in our view, very careful consideration must be given to combating impunity for serious crimes committed in 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">We draw two conclusions from the analyses. First, France supports a one-year extension of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), with a modified mandate and reductions in personnel. Secondly, in our view it is now very important that an UNMISET exit strategy succeed; we should try to define that exit strategy well in advance. It is important that the next resolution include a number of elements: setting a deadline for the withdrawal of the force; refocusing the mandate on assistance to the Timorese authorities to enable them to carry out reforms; a system for reviewing personnel levels at the end of the year; and strengthened coordination of the international community's action so as to ensure a smooth handover to transition and development partners, such as the relevant United Nations agencies, international financial institutions and bilateral partners.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Thomson</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I should like to associate my delegation with the sadness that others have expressed at the loss of life in Grozny.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Turning to the item on our agenda, I would like particularly to welcome the presence here of Senior Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto. We look forward to hearing her views. I take the effort she has made to be here today not only as a gesture to acknowledge the new phase that the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) is entering, but also as an acknowledgement of all that Kamalesh Sharma has achieved over his two years of close work with the Government and the people of Timor-Leste. We thank him for what he has done.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">I would like also to associate my delegation with the statement to be made by Ireland on behalf of the European Union later in this debate.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">We believe that the Secretary-General has made a compelling case for the extension of UNMISET's mandate for a further one-year consolidation phase. It is important to ensure that the investments of the international community and the achievements of the Timorese people and Government are not undermined. We look forward to engaging in negotiations this week on a draft resolution to extend UNMISET in a reduced form and with a modified mandate that reflects a coherent exit strategy. We welcome the fact that differences over the makeup of the security component of the follow-on mission appear now to have been resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned. We thank the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for its efforts in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">The Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>) sets out clearly the areas where progress has been achieved and those where continued international support is required. I will not dwell on them, but it is clearly the case that a smooth buildup in the governance capacity of East Timor is necessary for a smooth UNMISET drawdown. We welcome the strengthening of key public institutions, in particular through the passage of the Civil Service Act and the Organic Law on the Office of the Presidency, and we commend the positive steps that have been made in preparation for elections later this year, including the establishment of the National Electoral Commission and the finalizing of the legal framework under which the elections can take place.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">Areas where the United Kingdom is particularly keen to see further progress include the establishment of necessary legal and institutional frameworks such as a defence act and prison legislation, clarification of the roles and responsibilities of the Timorese police and armed forces, and improvement in the administration of justice.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">Finally, we welcome the continued constructive cooperation between Indonesia and Timor-Leste. We hope that that will facilitate the early resolution of outstanding issues, including agreement on a land border and the provision of justice for those responsible for serious crimes in 1999. With respect to the latter point, it is important that the work of the Serious Crimes Unit should continue.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I should like at the outset to express my sincere condolences and sympathy to the Russian delegation following the horrible terrorist attack that claimed the lives of the President of the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation, Mr. Akhmad Kadyrov, and others.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">Next, I would like to thank Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma for his excellent briefing on the situation in Timor-Leste and to congratulate him on the work that he and his team have accomplished in that country. Finally, I wish to welcome the presence of Ms. Ana Pessoa Pinto.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">We have noted that, in recent months, Timor-Leste has made significant progress in the areas of security and economic and social development, thanks to the efforts of the Government and the people of Timor-Leste, but also to the valuable assistance of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). However, a number of challenges remain to be met to better ensure stability, democracy and justice and to strengthen internal and external security and border control. Those are major challenges to the peace-building process in the young republic of Timor-Leste, but we are confident that they will be met with success.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">From that perspective, the elections to be organized in villages -- the first elections in Timor-Leste -- are a major test for the young republic. Important measures taken in preparation for those elections are timely and appropriate in that they will enable us to lay the groundwork for the electoral process in the country and will establish conditions for success for the first national elections. My delegation can only welcome that.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">The development of Timor-Leste's relations with all its neighbours will benefit the young republic economically, but also from a political and security standpoint. In that regard, we welcome the continued improvement of the relations between Timor-Leste and Indonesia, which has been made possible by the far-sightedness of their leaders. We hope that the two parties will soon reach agreement on the demarcation of their land borders, given the importance of that issue for the security of both countries. The willingness of both parties to establish good-neighbourly relations enables us to hope that they will swiftly resolve pending issues, because we believe that an improvement in bilateral relations will contribute greatly to the consolidation of the stability and security of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">Along the same lines, we hope that the negotiations between Timor-Leste and Australia on the question of the maritime border will move forward and that an agreement will soon be concluded, in view of that issue's importance for the exploitation of mineral resources in the Timor Sea, which will undoubtedly benefit the economy of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">As the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>) indicates, there have been delays with regard to the administration of justice and the training of the police. While responsibility for policing should be transferred to the national police of Timor-Leste on 19 May -- and we welcome that -- we believe that continued support for the training of the national police is necessary, since the establishment of public administration and the strengthening of internal and external security capacities are fundamental elements for Timor-Leste's viability and political stability. UNMISET's work in training the Timorese police has had very positive results; we therefore believe that it should continue during the consolidation phase.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">The maintenance of external security also requires UNMISET's presence to follow up on developments in the security situation and to support demarcation activities. We feel that the Secretary-General's recommendations in that area are reasonable and deserve support.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">Timor-Leste will continue to need financial support from the international community for some time. The support of United Nations funds and programmes, of international financial institutions and of multilateral and bilateral donors must be sustained and generous so that the country can attain the objectives of its national development plan.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Finally, we support the Secretary-General's recommendations concerning the extension of UNMISET's mandate for a one-year consolidation period.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Let me first address the Russian delegation in condemning the terrorist bomb attack in Grozny and in expressing our sympathy and our condolences to the Government of the Russian Federation and to the victims and the bereaved families.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">My delegation is grateful for the comprehensive briefing by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma, and for the report of the Secretary-General of 29 April on the situation in Timor-Leste (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>). In that connection, I would like to welcome the presence of Senior Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto as she participates in this Council meeting. I would also like to say that Germany aligns itself with the statement to be made later in this discussion by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">Germany commends the tremendous progress achieved by the people and the Government of Timor-Leste and by the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). The Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma, deserves our special tribute. We also welcome the excellent communication and goodwill that have characterized relations between Timor-Leste and Indonesia. Timor-Leste can rightly be described as a success story and as a true model for nation-building. Over the past five years, significant progress has been continuously achieved in all relevant areas.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">Whereas the security situation has generally been calm and peaceful, certain deficits remain. The Timorese police unit -- the Policia Nacional de Timor-Leste -- continues to suffer from a number of institutional weaknesses. Reports of the presence of armed groups are still a matter of concern. Unfortunately, we must acknowledge that the development of indigenous Timorese security capabilities remains at an early stage. We must also acknowledge the concern of the Timorese Government that an early withdrawal of the international security presence could lead to a deterioration of the situation. It is important that, during the consolidation phase, UNMISET retain some residual security-related elements to support Timor-Leste's ability to maintain its security and stability. We must make sure that the progress achieved so far will not be lost. Germany therefore supports the recommendation of the Secretary-General to extend the mandate of UNMISET, including its military component.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">The development of relations between Timor-Leste and Indonesia continues to benefit from the commitment to cooperation at the highest political level. However, as the report of the Secretary-General points out, some problems remain. We therefore call upon both parties to finalize the agreement on the border line, to conclude an arrangement for management of the border -- including in the areas of cooperation and security and the regulation of economic activity -- and to solve other outstanding issues, such as bringing to justice those responsible for serious crimes committed in 1999 and the return of refugees. Despite considerable efforts, 300 unresolved cases of Timorese children separated from their families in 1999 still demand attention. Progress in those areas will be crucial for the internal and external security of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">National reconciliation is a key factor in successful nation-building. We therefore commend the work of UNMISET also with regard to the other two areas of its mandate: first, support for the public administration and justice system, and for justice in the area of serious crimes; and, secondly, support for the development of law enforcement.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">We support the recommendation of the Secretary-General to continue this Mission. The envisaged configuration of 58 civilian advisers could help Timor-Leste cross a critical threshold of self-sufficiency in terms of developing key skills and capabilities while helping to ensure that essential tasks are discharged.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The international community's peacekeeping activities in Timor-Leste have provided a window of opportunity for progress. The extraordinary achievements that have been made offer an occasion for pride for the Timorese people and for the international community. We call on the Governments of Timor-Leste and of Indonesia to take the opportunity to resolve the outstanding issues before the final termination of UNMISET. We highly support and recommend the assistance of UNMISET in this endeavour upon request from both parties.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">There is good reason to believe that further joint efforts will enable the Timorese people to achieve the objective of a truly self-sufficient State, which they have pursued with such determination. The international community should stay committed to achieving that goal.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Guangya</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">We would like to express our strongest condemnation of the terrorist attack that took place on 9 May in Grozny, Chechnya, in the Russian Federation. We convey our condolences to the bereaved families of the victims and express our sympathy to the wounded.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">I should like to thank the Secretary-General for his report on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). I wish also to welcome the supplementary briefing by Mr. Sharma.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">In a few days, the people of East Timor will be celebrating the second anniversary of their independence. We are pleased to see that, with the support of the international community, the people of East Timor, through their creativity and hard work, have achieved considerable progress in all areas in the process of nation-building. The Government of East Timor has been effectively fulfilling its national administrative functions, and the social and economic development of East Timor has taken an encouraging first step. Its relationship with its neighbours is continuing to improve and develop. Indeed, the people of East Timor can justly be proud of their remarkable achievements.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">At this stage, the Government of East Timor is actively preparing for local elections throughout the country and will further develop its civil service, judicial and law-enforcement systems. We believe that those measures will have a positive impact on the future development of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">As a nascent State, East Timor continues to face a host of challenges in its quest for national stability and for economic and social development. The functions of the Government of East Timor need to be further strengthened. Indeed, the building of its infrastructure, as well as electoral preparations, are being hampered by financial difficulties. The administrative and judicial capacity of regions beyond Dili remains weak. In order fully to achieve social stability and sustainable economic development, the Government and the people of East Timor must make even greater efforts, and the continued support of the international community remains indispensable.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">We appreciate the active role played by UNMISET in the development and construction of East Timor. We endorse the Secretary-General's recommendation to extend UNMISET and to adjust its size and mandate appropriately. We hope that the Security Council will adopt the relevant draft resolution as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">We appeal to the international community to continue to provide assistance for the development of East Timor. China will, as always, support and participate in the economic reconstruction of East Timor. We are confident that the people of East Timor will achieve even greater accomplishments in future in the building of their nation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">Let me first join in the condolences expressed with regard to the terrorist attack in Grozny which took the life of President of the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation, Akhmad Kadyrov, and a number of other victims. We are prepared to work on a presidential statement to be made by the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">We welcome the briefing on Timor-Leste and the outstanding work done by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, and his team. We welcome also the presence here of the Senior Minister and Minister in the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of Timor-Leste, Ms. Ana Pessoa Pinto.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Chile supports the Secretary-General's proposal to extend the present United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) for an additional 12 months in a consolidation phase, and we believe that the proposed mandate is appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Regarding the first element referred to in the report, we fully agree that the provision of assistance with respect to the justice system and administrative structures is essential for political viability and stability. We are concerned by the extensive delays in the area of the administration of justice and by the shortcomings noted in the area of human rights and related proceedings, and we agree that there is a need to promote capacity in that area.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">As to the second aspect, namely strengthening law enforcement in the country, in particular through police training, we agree that there is a need for UNMISET and the international community to continue contributing to and supporting the training process for the national police of Timor-Leste. We welcome in particular the fact that its 3,021 staff members are already carrying out their tasks in all districts of the country. We reiterate the vital function of the Rapid Intervention Unit, and we welcome the fact that an adequate level of capability has been achieved. We deem it crucial also to continue to provide training for the Border Patrol Unit. Despite the progress achieved, we believe that the national police must continue with its training.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">With respect to the third element, namely the maintenance of security, we agree that this is a key element for achieving stability in Timor-Leste. While it is true that -- fortunately -- the situation in the country has been rather peaceful, we need to bear in mind all factors and not ignore possible sources of instability. We believe, therefore, that the Secretary-General's proposal is appropriate and reasonable.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Another essential element for achieving progress and true stability in Timor-Leste is sustainable economic development. In that respect, we hope that greater progress will be made in the exploitation of the country's mineral resources. We would also highlight the programmes financed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank for the creation of rural power stations, the construction of schools, road improvements, and the rehabilitation of marketplaces and health services.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">We are pleased with the excellent cooperation and political agreements between Timor-Leste and Indonesia. We hope that they will soon arrive at an agreement on land borders and find a solution to the problem of refugees, in particular regarding those responsible for serious crimes, so that they may be brought to trial.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">We also recognize the outstanding work and efforts of other regional actors and of donors from the international community with respect to this young country.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">In the area of human rights, we value the assistance provided by UNMISET in efforts to shed light on the crimes committed in 1999, and we recognize the need to continue decisively supporting the process for an additional year. In that connection, we particularly welcome the work carried out by the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation. We look forward with interest to the publication of its final report and recommendations in October of this year.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa11">Finally, we reiterate the need for a one-year extension of UNMISET, in a reduced size and with a modified mandate. We hope that the members of the Council will reach an agreement in that regard to support development and stability in Timor-Leste.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Holliday</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">We too would like to extend our condolences and our thoughts and prayers for the victims of the terrorist action in Grozny, which killed President Kadyrov and others. We look forward to working on a presidential statement on that matter.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">I would like to welcome Senior Minister Ana Pessoa to New York. We would also like to thank Ambassador Sharma for his presentation today and for his outstanding work as the Secretary-General's Special Representative at the head of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). His untiring efforts to promote political and economic development in East Timor will have a lasting effect on that new country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">As we stated in February, we agree with the Secretary-General that UNMISET should be extended to consolidate gains made during the past two years of the Mission, and we thank the Secretary-General for his revision of the components of the extended Mission. Although we recognize that at this time an UNMISET extension will increase stability in Timor-Leste, we believe the peacekeeping mission should end no later than May 2005, at which time the Government should resume full responsibility for its own security while continuing to receive support from elsewhere in the United Nations system and from other members of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">The Government and the people of Timor-Leste have made considerable strides towards self-sufficiency. With further assistance from the international donor community, United Nations agencies and UNMISET, we hope that the Timorese can increase public administrative capacity, develop strong security institutions and establish a strong judicial tradition with emphasis on human rights and the rule of law. Given the current limited capacity of Timor-Leste's public administration, we agree that further support from UNMISET in the form of civilian advisers will be necessary for the development of an independent, functioning civil administration. We expect that any assistance in that regard past May 2005 would be provided through normal bilateral and multilateral donor support.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">We were encouraged to learn that since the Secretary-General's latest report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>) was published, the Government of Timor-Leste acted to promulgate an organic law and disciplinary code for the Timorese police and an organic law for the Timorese defence forces. As we stated in February, the Government of Timor-Leste should do its part to nurture respect for the rule of law, and this action moves the Government closer to that goal. We look forward to hearing updates on the development of the Timor-Leste police and defence forces, and we ask that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General keep us informed of any new legislative and regulatory governmental actions in defining the respective roles and responsibilities of the Timorese security forces.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">We commend bilateral donors that are providing considerable assistance to Timor-Leste in the form of police training. After UNMISET ends in May 2005, we hope that those and other bilateral donors will continue to provide any training and assistance that may be required.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">We commend the work of the Serious Crimes Unit and underscore the usefulness of its role in addressing the issue of accountability regarding the human rights violations and atrocities committed in East Timor in 1999. As with other elements within UNMISET, we believe the Serious Crimes Unit should maintain close adherence to its completion strategy, ending investigations no later than November 2004 so that it can conclude all its trials by no later than May 2005. The Secretary-General stated in his report that the Serious Crimes Unit should focus resources in order to complete trial and appellate litigation in a timely manner. We urge all countries to cooperate fully with the Serious Crimes Unit. In order to achieve justice for all the victims of human rights abuses, the international community and the United Nations should consider an international truth commission as a means of achieving accountability and, ultimately, reconciliation in Timor-Leste by resolving outstanding cases.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">We look forward to working with our Council colleagues on a draft resolution to extend UNMISET. We hope a mandate extension can be adopted later this week.</p>

	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">We join colleagues in expressing our condolences and sympathy to the Russian Government and to the victims of the terrible act of terrorism in Grozny.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">We thank Mr. Kamalesh Sharma for his comprehensive briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">This is a crucial period for Timor-Leste. Much has been achieved by the people in building their nation, with the help of the international community. However, much remains to be done. After all, nation-building requires time, efforts and commitment in order for the process to bear fruit. As the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) expires on 20 May, that is foremost in our minds.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">In defining the new mandate of UNMISET, the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>) provides us with important factors to consider. In the report, the peace and security situation in Timor-Leste is characterized as having remained generally "calm and peaceful during the reporting period" (<i>para. 45</i>). The proposal for a military component has been justified as responding to exceptional situations that exceed the capacity of Timor-Leste security agencies to undertake preventive action to promote public order and to assist in the provision of security to United Nations premises and personnel there. On the basis of those justifications, my delegation fully supports the Secretary-General's recommendation to extend UNMISET for a further one-year consolidation phase.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">The Philippines agrees with the three main elements of the role of UNMISET during that consolidation phase: support for public administration and justice in Timor-Leste; support for the development of law enforcement; and support for the security and stability of Timor-Leste. As a country contributing to UNMISET, my country stands ready to provide support in the areas identified as requiring UNMISET's support in the consolidation phase.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">The Timor-Leste authorities and the Timorese have always demonstrated their commitment to fulfilling their responsibilities in nation-building, notwithstanding their very limited capacities. The presence at this meeting of the Council of Senior Minister Ana Pessoa further mirrors that commitment. My delegation is confident that the extension of UNMISET under the Secretary-General's proposed plan will contribute substantially to bringing Timor-Leste closer to self-sufficiency and to ensuring sustainable peace and stability in the country. However, my delegation's optimism is tempered by the realistic assessment that even after a one-year extension of UNMISET for a consolidation phase, many areas will still need further support and assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">Therefore, my delegation particularly appreciates, and wishes to invite attention to, the very forward-looking component of the report on the requirements remaining after May 2005. It may be timely to bear in mind at this point that peace in Timor-Leste -- as in any other country -- is predicated on just social and economic development. The report notes the limited revenue and widespread poverty in Timor-Leste, circumstances which continue to pose severe constraints on the country's social and economic development. While the forthcoming conference of development partners, to be held in Dili on 19 May, could provide some donor assistance, Timor-Leste's development should be pursued by generating more revenues from its own natural resources and industries.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">All the efforts made and gains achieved by UNMISET and the international community in ending the conflict and in nation-building in Timor-Leste would be for naught if, in the end, Timor-Leste's self-sufficiency could not be assured or sustained. Timor-Leste's immediate neighbours and the other countries in the region, the Philippines included, should be ready to go the extra mile in providing the appropriate support to Timor-Leste, not only to preserve but also to further the dividends of peace in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">The essential role of Timor-Leste's partners in the country's long-term development and the entire region's stability is a crucial one. When we consider the situation there, it may be relevant to note that some of the lessons learned have been applied and could be applied to other United Nations operations. United Nations involvement and regional leadership there were successful because they had wide domestic support. United Nations efforts were focused on getting the cooperation of Indonesia, and the accent was on persuasion and underscoring the realities on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">The Timor-Leste experience is one of the best examples of consolidated action among the Council, the Secretary-General, regional players led by the Association of South-East Asian Nations, Australia and Japan, and the international community at large. We recognize Ambassador Sharma's role in that regard. As the Security Council's involvement recedes, the rest of the United Nations system will need to take up the challenge of ensuring successful post-conflict recovery in Timor-Leste.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adechi</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I should like to begin by conveying our condolences to the Government of the Russian Federation. We condemn the terrorist attack carried out in Grozny on 9 May. We extend our sympathy to the bereaved families.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">We also wish to welcome here the Minister of State of Timor-Leste, Ms. Ana Pessoa Pinto.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Like preceding speakers, we thank the Secretary-General for his latest report on the situation in Timor-Leste (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>). We also thank his Special Representative, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, for his excellent briefing and his personal account. Having listened to Mr. Kamalesh Sharma's briefing and read the report, we indeed welcome the ongoing progress made by the Government and the people of Timor-Leste in establishing democratic institutions and building the structure of a viable State. We welcome the adoption by the national Parliament of the Organic Law on the Office of the Presidency, which opens the way to establishing two new constitutional bodies -- the Superior Council of Defence and Security and the Council of State.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">Recent progress made by the East Timor national police augurs well for the upcoming transfer of police authority to the Timorese Government, despite the shortage of capacity and available resources. It is important that the instruments regulating the police be adopted soon in order to create a republican institution that will ensure the rule of law and freedom for all citizens. Special attention must be given to efforts aimed at avoiding excessive use of force and at ensuring greater respect for human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">We moreover welcome the improved security situation, as well as the work done by the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) in the area of transferring competences. We fully support the modification of the composition of UNMISET in order to deal with the problems identified in that regard. We believe that that will enable Timor-Leste ultimately to assume full responsibility for security and stability throughout its national territory.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">The Government of Timor-Leste's control of that sovereign function will also depend on maintaining good relations with its neighbours, which means dealing with many pending issues such as finalizing border demarcation, the return of refugees from the western part of Timor and establishing maritime crossing points. We therefore urge Timor-Leste, Indonesia and Australia to intensify their cooperation to make progress in these matters.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">Regarding public administration and justice, we welcome the efforts aimed at adopting a law on the establishment of an Office of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice. Given the crucial role that Office will play in monitoring respect for human rights, it is necessary that the international community provide Timor-Leste with greater support for its establishment. Like the Secretary-General, we stress the need to continue efforts to fight impunity and to promote national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">As I said in my statement on 20 February 2004, Timor-Leste is now among the least developed countries. The assessment of the economic and social situation of the country contained in the Secretary-General's report indicates the magnitude of the challenges to be addressed. In that regard, we believe that the problems of unemployment and difficulties encountered in the reintegration of ex-combatants are of real concern and merit the special attention of the international community. In that regard, UNMISET's exit strategy must be coupled with a strategy for strengthening Timor-Leste's public administration and productive capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">In the final analysis, we can state that the many problems noted in Timor-Leste argue in favour of supporting the Secretary-General's recommendation to extend the UNMISET mandate for one year. Therefore, we anticipate with great hope the upcoming conference of Timor-Leste's development partners, scheduled for 19 May 2004. We are convinced that the international community will take that opportunity to step up its support to the Timorese people, who are so resolutely committed to sustained economic growth and sustainable development.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I cannot start without expressing outrage at and strongly condemning the terrorist attack in Grozny, Russian Federation. Romania's sympathy and condolences go to the victims and the bereaved families and to the people and the Government of the Russian Federation.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">On the issue at hand, I join other members of the Council in thanking the Secretary-General for his report on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>) and Special Representative Sharma for his briefing. My delegation welcomes the participation in this Council meeting of Senior Minister Ana Pessoa of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">As Romania aligns itself with the statement to be made shortly by the Permanent Representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union, I will limit myself to making a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">I take this opportunity to congratulate the authorities of Timor-Leste for their steady efforts and encouraging achievements towards developing their country as a stable and democratic nation. All the remarkable progress that has been achieved so far has brought closer the moment when responsibility will be transferred from the international presence to the people and the Government of Timor-Leste. The Security Council, bilateral donors and the wider international community have invested enormous energy and expectations in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">Remarkable success has been achieved so far, but further international assistance will be required in order to consolidate and secure its irreversibility. That vision is reflected in the recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his special report of February 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-117.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/117</a>) and is developed further in his most recent report. This vision is shared by Romania, which is supportive of the Secretary-General's recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">As the report states, ongoing international support continues to be essential to enable Timor-Leste to reach a critical threshold of self-sufficiency. Romania believes that that support can best be provided through a continued multisector United Nations presence in Timor-Leste that includes a limited military component.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">The extension of UNMISET for a further one-year consolidation phase with a reduced size and a modified mandate will consolidate momentum for the development of full Timorese self-sufficiency and will confirm Timor-Leste as a fine example of successful United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">Finally, I wish to express Romania's satisfaction with the continued development of cooperation between Timor-Leste and Indonesia. We hope that the political commitment will be shortly followed by concrete results in the finalization of an agreement on the border line, as well as in addressing the issue of former refugees remaining in West Timor. Likewise, we encourage the strengthening of bilateral cooperation in bringing those responsible for serious crimes to justice.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Menéndez</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">We wish in turn to begin by conveying our condolences to the Government and people of the Russian Federation for the terrorist attack committed yesterday.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">We welcome the briefing provided by Ambassador Sharma and congratulate him heartily on his work as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for East Timor. We also welcome the presence of Minister Pessoa Pinto here at this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">My delegation fully endorses the statement to be made by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union. We wish to add a few brief comments of our own.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">First, we wholeheartedly support the Secretary-General's recommendation to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor for a further year in order to consolidate and further strengthen the enormous progress registered by Timor-Leste since it achieved independence. We believe that the composition and objectives of the three programmes proposed by the Secretary-General will make it possible to accomplish those tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">As we said here in February, the additional efforts proposed are relatively modest in comparison to achievements made to date. At the same time, it is essential that we successfully conclude the consolidation of the institutions of Timor-Leste and avoid any setbacks. To that end, we need the full cooperation of the Timorese institutions, just as they have cooperated with us so far. The Secretary-General is quite right to note that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg016-bk02-pa06">"The Timorese leadership can lay the foundations for future progress by fostering a culture of political dialogue and debate, anchored in the values of human rights, tolerance and respect for the law" (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>, para. 69</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">as well as by promoting key legislation in the areas of human rights, public administration, anti-corruption, policing and defence.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">We welcome the excellent cooperation shown by the Governments of Timor-Leste and Indonesia and hope that it will bear fruit in the settlement of two principal issues: the delimitation of their land borders and the presence of thousands of refugees in West Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">In conclusion, the United Nations can be proud of the success achieved by the people of Timor-Leste with the support of the international community. Spain is prepared to continue to contribute to the consolidation of the self-sufficiency and full development of Timor-Leste.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I would like to associate the delegation of Brazil with the condolences expressed by previous speakers to the Russian Federation and to the victims' families over the terrible and cowardly terrorist act that killed President Akhmad Kadyrov and other persons in Grozny, Chechnya, yesterday.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">I express my appreciation to you, Sir, for convening this meeting and to Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma for introducing the Secretary-General's report. The positive developments taking place in Timor-Leste can be attributed to a large extent to Ambassador Sharma's able and forward-looking leadership, as well as to the work that the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) is undertaking in the country. I would like to join you, Sir, and other speakers in thanking Ambassador Sharma for his invaluable work as Special Representative of the Secretary-General for East Timor. We wish him the best.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">I would also like to welcome the presence at this meeting of Timor-Leste's Senior Minister, Ana Pessoa Pinto.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">The progress achieved so far must be consolidated into a stable Timor-Leste with improved political, social and economic conditions. Our steadfast cooperation in a good number of critical areas is still required to underpin the exercise of sovereignty by the East Timorese. We therefore concur with the Secretary-General's recommendations regarding the extension of UNMISET for a consolidation phase, reduced in size and under a modified mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Improvements in the security sector, in particular the recent approval of key legislation concerning the police and defence sectors, have been encouraging. Local authorities are fulfilling their commitments and we expect Timor-Leste to further develop its own capability and to reach self-sufficiency in security with the support of the international community. The extension of UNMISET's mandate will prove an important measure to achieve this goal.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">As the Secretary-General points out, limited revenue and widespread poverty in the country continue to pose severe constraints on reconstruction and development efforts. The expected flow of revenue from the exploration for oil and gas in the Timor Sea has not materialized. Progress in this area is crucial to providing sustained means of income for the people of Timor-Leste. In this regard, we welcome the convening of a conference of development partners in Dili on 19 May and we concur with the Secretary-General's assessment that agreement between Australia and Timor-Leste on exploiting mineral resources in the Timor Sea, in a mutually beneficial manner, would represent an essential contribution to that effort.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">Brazil also welcomes the steady improvement of relations between the Governments of Timor-Leste and Indonesia. Brasilia has been actively supporting Jakarta and Dili in their efforts to build upon their recent achievements and strengthen new areas of cooperation. While fully understanding all parties' concerns and constraints, we believe that there is enough common ground to meet the requirements for justice, stability and peace.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">Stability and improved economic and social conditions in Timor-Leste are extremely relevant not only for the region, but also for all members of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. On their behalf, we would like to take this opportunity to convey our appreciation for all international assistance already provided to the country. We expect the international community, through the United Nations and its agencies, as well as bilaterally, to continue providing support to the East Timorese. The decision to be taken by this Council concerning the extension of UNMISET can reflect such willingness.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">No one wants an open-ended mission in Timor-Leste. A clear exit strategy has been put forward by the Secretary-General in his report, taking into account the need for capacity-building and the importance of not jeopardizing progress achieved so far. It is also in the best interests of the international community that Timor-Leste remain a showcase for the United Nations accomplishments.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">Finally, I would like to inform the Council that Angola and Brazil will be circulating a draft resolution regarding the extension of UNMISET's mandate for consideration by the Council's members. We hope that the Council will be able to adopt the draft resolution by the end of this week.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Pakistan.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">Pakistan adds its condemnation of the act of terrorism in Grozny and conveys its deepest condolences to the Russian Federation and to the families of the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">I would like to thank Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma for introducing the Secretary-General's report and for updating us on the situation in Timor-Leste. Pakistan has extended full support for the success of the new State of Timor-Leste -- a State that emerged in an exemplary exercise of the right of self-determination, a Charter principle to which Pakistan is deeply committed.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">Timor-Leste has made remarkable progress since its independence two years ago. Credit for that must go first and foremost to the people and Government of Timor-Leste. We appreciate in particular the bold efforts of the Timorese leadership to encourage national reconciliation. We hope that it will continue to strive to heal the deep wounds of the past, both internal and external, and to build the foundations for sustainable peace and progress.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">Pakistan supports the efforts of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) to consolidate peace and assist international development in Timor-Leste. We support the extension of its mandate for a further year, as recommended by the Secretary-General. We believe that that is necessary to allow the Mission to fulfil its mandate. We also note the report's recommendations for a new composition of the Mission's downsized force structure, which includes both military and police units.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">The outstanding tasks for UNMISET include providing support to Timor-Leste in key areas: public administration and justice, development of law enforcement and the maintenance of security and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">We must bear in mind the observation in the Secretary-General's report</p>
	<blockquote id="pg018-bk01-pa08">"that the provision of support through peacekeeping can only meet the most urgent of the country's requirements. It must be complemented and built upon by bilateral and multilateral support, if real progress is to take place." (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>, para. 72</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">In our view, the most imposing long-term challenge confronting Timor-Leste remains the promotion of economic prosperity. International assistance will continue to be indispensable for that purpose. The international community must also continue to assist the new country even after UNMISET's departure. The continued support of Timor-Leste's neighbours is vital in that context.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">Pakistan believes that the development of close and friendly relations between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is of utmost importance and is in the best interest of both neighbours. We are confident that both sides will continue to work together to resolve their outstanding issues, in particular the arrangements for the demarcation and management of their common border as well as strengthening mutual support and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">We hope that Timor-Leste's other neighbours, including Australia, will make every endeavour to resolve their bilateral issues with Timor-Leste in order to allow the new country to attain its full economic potential.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">Timor-Leste is widely considered a success story for United Nations peacekeeping. However, as Kamalesh Sharma said today, success is a retrospective judgement. The real success of the United Nations in Timor-Leste will be measured in years and perhaps decades. Timor-Leste will continue to need the support of the international community in the remaining phases of UNMISET's presence and beyond. All efforts must be made to ensure that the gains so painstakingly achieved are consolidated and are not lost, and that Timor-Leste is remembered in history as a model of collaboration between a committed national leadership and a responsive and generous international community.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa13">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa14">As another measure to optimize the use of our time, and in order to allow as many delegations to take the floor as possible, I will not individually invite speakers to take seats at the table and to resume their seats on the side. When a speaker is taking the floor, the Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the list at the table. I thank the non-members for their cooperation and understanding.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa15">I now give the floor to Mrs. Ana Pessoa Pinto, Senior Minister and Minister in the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of Timor-Leste.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Pessoa Pinto</span> <span class="nation">Timor-Leste</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, this is the first time that I appear before such an august body that has contributed so much to my country's freedom and well-being. Hence, my first words are necessarily of gratitude for the Council's unrelenting interest and support, without which the progress we have made so far would not have been possible.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">You are all very familiar with our Senior Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, José Ramos-Horta, who sends his warm regards. He has been in Denpasar, Bali, this weekend in meetings with his Indonesian colleague and friend, Hassan Wirayuda. Together they have reviewed the progress so far on our efforts to demarcate our common land border, as well as addressing other residual issues.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">It is a particular pleasure for me to be able to participate in this meeting of the Council, which will consider both the last report of the Secretary-General and the last statement of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General under the Council's current mandate, leading to a consideration by the Council of a resolution on the extension of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) with a modified mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">The story of the association of the United Nations with my country is a unique and inspiring chapter in the history of our people and will always be linked to the attainment of our independence and the vision of self-reliance and social and economic fulfilment we are striving to accomplish.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">I would like to acknowledge the historic and unique partnership that binds us so closely together. Starting with a resolution of the General Assembly, the contribution of the Special Envoys of the Secretary-General, the role of the United Nations in conducting the referendum, the endorsement of the INTERFET by the Council in a particularly tragic time for our people, the executive administration provided by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in close cooperation with the Transitional Government of Timor-Leste, the national parliamentary elections, the election of the President and, most recently, the Mission of Support in specific areas to the first Government of Timor-Leste offer a chain of association that cannot be separated from the fulfilment of the aspirations of our people. It is appropriate to recall that, now that we are entering the phase of gradual closure of that special relationship.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">In historical terms, there was no road map, but together we have managed to rebuild a nation. The independent and self-confident State of Timor-Leste has emerged from the debris of disorder and desperation that is so fresh in our minds.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>), which highlights many important areas where considerable progress has been made. However, I will not dwell on those achievements. The report also identifies shortcomings and points the way forward, stressing the need for concerted action, both by the Government and people of Timor-Leste and the country's generous development partners.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">However, it is appropriate to clarify that the investigations of a number of civil servants and police officers was due to the fact that the political rallies referred to in the Secretary-General's report took place over two consecutive days, one of which was a work day, were and conducted during work hours while the police officers were in uniform.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">In that regard, I would also like to stress that following the approval of the Civil Service Act, which embodies the code of conduct and disciplinary rules and procedures, forms and manuals have been prepared and finalized with the valuable assistance of UNDP advisors to facilitate the understanding and the dissemination of the Act. A major programme of dissemination is being prepared and will involve various Government institutions, including the Ministry of State Management, the Inspector General, the Human Rights Advisor and the Advisor for Gender in the Office of the Prime Minister, and will also involve members of Parliament and civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">In relation to civil society, allow me to focus on the cooperation of the Catholic Church with the Government to instil a culture of ethical and moral values where transparency and accountability are not merely fashionable slogans. Together, the Government, the Church, the presidency and the national Parliament are forging a new alliance to revive our cultural values and beliefs. The Church's programme was launched at the ordination of Don Alberto Ricardo as bishop of Dili on 2 May 2004. The programme is anchored in the Church's social doctrine, with the aim of attaining the participation of women, preventing HIV/AIDS and domestic violence and embarking on responsible family planning where education and moral values play a pivotal role.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">With regard to the tensions in the Dili mosque, it is worth noting that the mosque was built and is owned by the Timorese Muslim community and that it has been illegally occupied since "black September" in 1999; it has since been a source of problems. Today there are close to 300 undocumented and illegal immigrants living within the confines of the mosque. I am pleased to report that tensions have eased considerably, thanks to the professionalism of our police, working in conjunction with the human rights adviser to the Prime Minister and the International Organization for Migration, and thanks to the tolerance of my Government.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa12">All illegal aliens occupying the mosque have been advised by the Government that they are required to present themselves to the Immigration Department and to provide their documentation to the authorities for verification. Those that are without identification papers are required to contact their respective embassies. To facilitate this, the Government has extended the deadline. Those not in possession of the required papers are at risk of being expelled; applications for permanent visas will be processed on a case-by-case basis and according to the laws of Timor-Leste. Resolution of this issue will further enable Timorese Muslims to exercise their constitutional and fundamental human right to freedom of religion, which until now has been jeopardized by the illegal immigrants occupying the mosque.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa13">I am also glad to inform the Council that the Organic Law on the Policia Nacional de Timor-Leste (PNTL) and the Organic Law on the Timorese Armed Forces (F-FDTL) have been approved and have been promulgated by the President and that they have entered into force. The law on a code of conduct, disciplinary rules and procedures for the PNTL has also been approved by the Council of Ministers and is expected to be promulgated by the President and published in the official gazette by Thursday of this week. As pointed out, those laws are of great importance for the maintenance of law and order, because they provide clarity concerning the roles of the police and armed forces, particularly with regard to backup arrangements for support to civil power.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa14">We would like also to thank Ambassador Sharma for his insightful presentation of the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>). We have worked closely with him, and we feel a deep resonance with what he has said. As has been pointed out, we have been through good and not so good times together. Ambassador Sharma knows our trials and tribulations and has assisted us in facing them with solidarity, wisdom and commitment. We are sorry that he will be leaving Timor-Leste at the end of the present mandate of UNMISET. We wish him all the best and are confident that he will succeed in his future endeavours.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa15">We are also convinced that the Secretary-General will nominate an experienced special representative to succeed him, as he did when he chose Ambassador Sharma to follow in the distinguished footsteps of Sergio Vieira de Mello, to whose memory we again pay our deep respects. As this is my first time addressing the Security-Council, I wish to acknowledge the invaluable contribution that Sergio made to our nation. I feel he was one of us.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa16">I agree that much needs to be done to establish a society based on respect for the rule of law. The creation and continued professionalism of an impartial, accountable and responsive police service is an important element, and so is the development of the judiciary. I am sure that members will appreciate that, the importance of those goals notwithstanding, we have worked within a very compressed time frame: on the fast forward button, as it were. The results must be considered in that perspective.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa17">I trust that, through the deployment of police technical advisers, the provision of judge-mentors and the programme of assistance to core administrative structures and to the justice system, the support of the United Nations will contribute to the achievement of our goals. Those officers, working in harmony with their Timorese counterparts and conscious of the cultural sensitivities and the needs of our country, will enjoy unstinted cooperation with a view to meeting our shared objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa18">I am grateful that the international community has appreciated the need for maintenance of a small military contingent to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and the PNTL in emergencies, to preserve and restore the fragile peace that currently exists.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa19">Timor-Leste enjoys the best of relations with its neighbours. We acknowledge the goodwill towards Timor-Leste that exists at all levels in Indonesia and particularly the efforts deployed by Indonesia's leaders to resolve outstanding issues. However, individuals and groups inimical to our interests still exist. We trust that the support of the international community, directed towards resettlement of refugees, promotion of reconciliation and economic and social development, will produce concrete results and diminish such threats. I would like to note that finalization of the land border demarcation between Indonesia and Timor-Leste and early operationalization of agreements to facilitate cross-border links between residents of border areas on both sides would contribute significantly to that process. Despite political will and determination on both sides, we have failed to reach agreement, through a lack of technical development, on meeting our deadlines. Timor-Leste would enhance its efforts, in cooperation with Indonesia, so as to finalize an agreement before the end of June 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa20">Negotiations on our maritime border with Australia have begun, with the first formal round having been held in Dili. The position of my Government on this is simple and clear: we are entitled to a just and fair maritime boundary with our two neighbours, Australia and Indonesia; and we are guided by principles of international Law and practice.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa21">Between Timor-Leste and Australia, in an area that is far closer to our shores, lie vast reserves of oil and gas. A just and fair resolution of this issue would mean better health care, education and economic independence for our country, with the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals. We know that international law is on our side, and we believe that Australia, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, as a neighbour and as a friend, will find its way to respect justice and democratic principles.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa22">I must emphasize the need for substantial and continuing support from our development partners to overcome the formidable challenges before our new nation. No efforts at enlightened governance can succeed unless we can also advance economically and show visible improvements in the quality of life and in terms of the creation of jobs. The international community must assist in ensuring that the investments made in strengthening our self-governing capability are a springboard to prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa23">We would like to thank the Secretary-General for having outlined several mechanisms and requirements, including the appointment of Timorese counterparts, so that maximum advantage can be gained from the support being extended by the international community through the Council. We appreciate that advice, and we shall continue our endeavours in that direction. It will have been noted that in recent months, great progress has been made in that respect and many of the recommendations in the report of the Secretary-General have been met. However, I would like to stress that, practically speaking, it is impossible to run until one learns to walk.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa24">While we certainly do not intend to rest on our accomplishments, further progress in the areas of good governance and political development will require substantial economic growth and social development. I trust that Timor-Leste will continue to benefit from the support and assistance of the international community in that regard, so as to guarantee that the success story is sustainable and that it is a reason for all of us here to be proud.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Singapore.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahbubani</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">At the outset, we would like to associate ourselves with our colleagues in expressing our condemnation of the bombing that took place in Grozny. We express our condolences to the families of those who lost who lives and our sympathies to those who were wounded.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">Thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. We are pleased that the Security Council has once again provided an opportunity for concerned non-Council members to air their views on this important subject. Let me quickly thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno for the latest report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>). At the same time, I should like to join Senior Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto in paying a special tribute to Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma for the work he has done. I was present in this Chamber when he was appointed. We had no certainty then that today we would be as well off as we are. We owe Ambassador Sharma a special vote of thanks for all the success we have had. We wish him all the best.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa03">I will be concise, as Singapore's position on this issue is well known. The Council's last public meeting on Timor-Leste was held only three months ago. At that time, we heard nearly every speaker support an extension of the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) for a further one-year consolidation phase. While some progress has been made since February, it remains irrefutable that Timor-Leste will still require assistance in a number of areas beyond May 2004 if the gains made to date are to be sustained. Without the continued support of the United Nations and the rest of the international community, Timor-Leste's path to self-sufficiency could very well be jeopardized.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa04">The Secretary-General has once again set out in his report a compelling case for the extension of the Mission, with a modified mandate and a significantly reduced presence of about 700 international personnel. Singapore fully supports all of the Secretary-General's recommendations, and we urge the Council to support and endorse them as well. It is important that we ensure that the Secretary-General is provided with the resources he requires, across the three broad programmes that he has proposed, to allow Timor-Leste to reach a critical threshold of self-sufficiency. Such an additional investment would seem relatively modest, considering the scale of the task at hand and the difference it would make.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa05">Let me add here that Singapore strongly supports the proposed deployment of an international response unit of 125 gendarmerie, along with the earlier proposed military component of some 310 formed troops, to form a two-element security force. Given the continued possibility of challenges across the security spectrum, the complementary deployment of both the gendarmerie unit and the military component would enable UNMISET to assist the Timor-Leste Government in dealing with a range of security challenges, even while Timor-Leste builds up its own capacities in that arena.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa06">As the Senior Minister said only a few minutes ago, we must be wary of being overconfident or hasty, and mindful that we do not prematurely withdraw our support for Timor-Leste. The fragility of the progress made so far cannot be overstated. Let us stay the course and ensure that the gains made so far are consolidated and that a solid foundation is laid for Timor-Leste's future development.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa07">This morning, I heard Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma say that a success story is a retrospective evaluation. I also heard your comment on that subject, Mr. President. But let me add here that the continuation of this success story and the perception that it is a success story are assets that the Security Council has. At a time when the Council should be concerned about its standing in the world, it helps the Council to have the continuation of a success story such as Timor-Leste. That is a responsibility that we hope the Council will not walk away from.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Ireland.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ryan</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa01">The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland, Mr. Brian Cowen, speaking in his capacity as President of the Council of the European Union, yesterday condemned the terrorist attack during the Victory Day celebrations at the Dynamo stadium in Grozny. Minister Cowen said:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg022-bk03-pa02">"I condemn utterly this appalling act of terror in a crowded stadium, which has claimed the lives of many people, including the President of the Chechen Republic, Mr. Kadyrov. I extend my condolences to the families of all the victims of this terrible act. No political cause can justify terrorism."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa03">As this morning is my first opportunity to address the Council in the month of May, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, and Pakistan on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council, and to thank your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of Germany, for the excellent manner in which he and his delegation executed the presidency in the month of April. With your indulgence, Mr. President, I would also like to note that this morning's statement to the Security Council by the European Union is the first since the enlargement of the Union, on 1 May.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa04">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey; the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro; and the European Free Trade Association countries Iceland and Liechtenstein, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa05">The European Union welcomes this opportunity to express once again our support for the remarkable achievements made since independence by the people of Timor-Leste, with the assistance of the United Nations, the support of the Security Council and the commitment of the wider international community. In that regard, I recall and refer the Council to the EU's most recent statement on Timor-Leste, delivered here in this Chamber on 20 February 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa06">The European Union supports the efforts of the Government of Timor-Leste to consolidate the political institutions, to promote the social and economic development of the country and to uphold the rule of law while building a new nation. In particular, the European Union welcomes developments such as the largely calm security situation, the continuing positive relationship between Timor-Leste and Indonesia, the continuing development of the country's public administration, the fact that the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation continues to provide a community-based solution for less serious crimes committed in connection with the political conflict, and the assumption of responsibility for routine policing throughout the country by the national police force.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa07">In addition, and in the context of ending impunity and promoting a culture of accountability and transparency, the European Union notes with interest the continuing process of prosecuting those accused of serious crimes. The European Union will continue to follow closely the relevant trials in Dili and Jakarta.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa08">Much remains to be done in all these fields and, while the primary responsibility for a successful transition lies with the Timorese people themselves, it remains incumbent on the international community to help consolidate the progress that is so evident in Timor-Leste. In this regard, the European Union looks forward to the planned conference of development partners in Dili on 19 May.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa09">The EU recognizes that a critical element of the success so far has been the hard work of the men and women of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), and we commend them, and those countries which have supported them in their efforts, for their dedication. The European Union recalls the advice of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma, that the international community should consider carefully the completion of UNMISET's drawdown while also taking stock of what has been achieved, reflecting on the remaining tasks to be completed, and deciding on the best way forward to fulfil the legitimate needs of Timor-Leste in the post-May 2004 period.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa10">In that regard, the European Union thanks the Secretary-General for his most recent report on and assessment of the current situation in Timor-Leste. The EU welcomes the report's assessment that the extraordinary progress that has taken place has left no doubt as to the momentum of transfer of responsibility to Timor-Leste. In particular, the European Union welcomes the reported progress towards the adoption of legislation for key public institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa11">Notwithstanding the progress made to date, the European Union shares the Secretary-General's view that further assistance will be needed to consolidate the achievements already made. In this regard, a continuing though modified presence for UNMISET seems required. The European Union looks forward to the outcome of the Security Council's consideration of the Secretary-General's analysis and his recommendation for an extension of UNMISET for a further one-year consolidation phase, with appropriate modifications to its mandate and composition.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Ireland for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Japan, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haraguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">Let me begin by expressing our deepest condolences to the Government of the Russian Federation for the lives that were lost, including that of President Kadyrov, in the bombing incident that took place in the Republic of Chechnya on 9 May. Such terrorist acts should never be tolerated on any grounds.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this public meeting. I would also like to thank Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his comprehensive briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa03">Timor-Leste will soon commemorate the second anniversary of its independence. Looking back at the last several years, the Government of Japan is deeply gratified to see that the Government of Timor-Leste and its people have been working as a united whole to build, brick by brick, the foundations of a new, independent State out of the turmoil that preceded its formation, with the support of the international community, especially the United Nations and the parties concerned, including Indonesia. The role of United Nations in particular has been significant. Japan reiterates its sincere appreciation for the contributions made by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) under the leadership of the late Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa04">As a nation belonging to the Asia-Pacific region, Japan attaches special importance to the stability and development of Timor-Leste and has been devoting its efforts to helping to achieve those objectives. We are therefore delighted that Timor-Leste has attained its current level of progress, after travelling such a long way on the path towards independent statehood. At the same time, my Government is of the view that the international community must continue to extend its support, so that continued progress for peace and development in Timor-Leste is ensured. More concretely, we believe it is crucially important to make certain that the valuable incipient achievements in the areas of peace, the rule of law, respect for human rights and development take root and endure, and we believe there is still an important role for the United Nations to play in helping to reach that objective.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa05">From that point of view, the Government of Japan welcomes the Secretary-General's proposal to extend the mandate of UNMISET for a one-year consolidation phase, while clarifying which tasks are truly necessary. At the most recent Security Council meeting on this issue, Member States expressed various opinions in response to the Secretary-General's proposal, and the stakeholders in this enterprise, including Japan, have been in close contact with the Secretariat in an effort to build a consensus. My Government is convinced that this proposal is one which the international community can endorse unanimously.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa06">What has been achieved by the international community in Timor-Leste since the United Nations undertook the transitional administration there may be regarded as a striking success story. However, in order for the story to be followed through to its conclusion, UNMISET must complete its activities and achieve its goals within this final one-year period. It is therefore necessary to conclude during this period the transition from the phase of peacekeeping operations for resolution of the conflict to the next phase of development activities, conducted through bilateral channels or relevant international institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa07">Timor-Leste in turn must recognize that this will be the final one-year period of active assistance on the part of the United Nations peacekeeping operation and must redouble its efforts to ensure that it will be able to stand on its own. In that connection, the review of the size of UNMISET, which is scheduled to be conducted at the end of this year on the basis of the progress achieved at that point towards the fulfilment of the mandate, should be duly carried out.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa08">In support of the building of a sustainable Timor-Leste, Japan has pledged and has been steadily implementing assistance of up to $60 million over the first three years following independence, with a focus on peace-building and on reconstruction in the three key areas of agriculture, infrastructure and human resources development. We are pleased to learn that the roads and bridges which the Engineering Group of our Self-Defence Forces has constructed and repaired for the activities of UNMISET is benefiting the people of Timor-Leste as well. We also plan to hand over the equipment of the Engineering Group, including various types of vehicles, to the Government of Timor-Leste, in the hopes that it will meet their requirements. My Government is also making efforts to transfer technology by educating Timor-Leste Government staff in the operation, maintenance and management of the donated equipment and material. We believe that such support is in line with the needs of Timor-Leste as described in the report of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa09">Japan has thus been devoting its energies, through the activities of the Self-Defence Forces Engineering Group and through official development assistance, to the development of Timor-Leste. There remain, however, many areas in which further international assistance for nation-building is needed. For that reason, my Government believes that it is essential for the international community to continue its assistance to Timor-Leste in those areas where support is still required through well-coordinated activities of the United Nations and bilateral contributions.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa10">Finally, I wish to underscore once again how important this final one-year period will be for Timor-Leste. The Government of Japan is convinced that, through the efforts of UNMISET and the people of Timor-Leste, guided by their wise leaders, stability and the foundations for development in Timor-Leste will be strengthened, and the United Nations peacekeeping operation will successfully complete its mission.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of India.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nambiar</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">The Government of India has strongly condemned the heinous terrorist attack in Grozny, which killed the President of the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation and others. We extend our condolences to the Government and the people of the Russian Federation and to the bereaved families on this tragic occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">We felicitate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May. I also take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Gunter Pleuger of Germany for his capable stewardship of the Council during the eventful month of April.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">It has been almost two years since Timor-Leste attained its independence. That period has seen rapid progress in the emergence of Timor-Leste from conflict into confidence as a new member of the international community. In an era increasingly characterized by global conflict and conflagration, the success of this peace-building exercise, spearheaded by the United Nations, represents optimism and hope for the future. We are happy to have Senior Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto participating in this meeting of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">The comprehensive support of the international community -- mainly in the form of assistance for political and socio-economic development, capacity-building and security -- has been instrumental in facilitating Timor-Leste's emergence as a viable State within the international community. This process needs to be consolidated. India supports the Secretary-General's recommendation, as contained in his report dated 29 April 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>), that the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) be extended for a further, one-year phase to enable Timor-Leste to attain a critical threshold of self-sufficiency.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">The three broad programmes that the extended United Nations mandate would facilitate appear fully justified, given the reduced size of the Mission and the imperative of ensuring a sound and logical conclusion to one of the most successful exercises in post-conflict peace-building that the United Nations has undertaken in recent years. We note from the Secretary-General's report that the first programme, for public administration and justice, would be undertaken by 58 civilian experts; the second programme, for the development of law enforcement, would be advanced through 157 civilian police advisers; and the third programme, support for the security and stability of Time-Leste, would be effected through 42 military liaison officers, 310 formed military and 125 gendarmerie.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Those support measures indicate a minimum, truncated international presence. The Secretary-General has noted in his report that it was the extraordinary progress that had taken place which permitted this swift downsizing in the international presence on the ground, leaving no doubt as to the momentum of the transfer of responsibility to Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">We agree with the Secretary-General when he counsels Timor-Leste and its sagacious leadership to further build on and consolidate the gains achieved by taking full advantage of the assistance and by making practical and policy decisions in a timely manner. Among the critical issues that require to be addressed early by the Government of Timor-Leste are the adoption of key legislation for public institutions, preparation for local elections through voter registration and other logistical arrangements, measures to enhance economic development and self-sufficiency, and the consolidation of Timor-Leste's security institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">The international community cannot remain permanently engaged. The United Nations role and assistance in Timor-Leste will have to cede to the country's growing capacity and confidence in governance. Multilateral assistance of the current scale will also have to be substituted progressively by bilateral and regional cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">India's relationship with Timor-Leste is characterized by exceptionally close bilateral ties marked by full understanding and support for one another's concerns. We welcomed the emergence of Timor-Leste as an independent nation in May 2002 and have keenly followed its successful efforts at democratic institution-building as well as economic development. We have assisted in Timor-Leste's socio-economic development through bilateral technical training programmes in capacity-building, university education and the deputation of experts for rural development. We take this opportunity to compliment the Timorese leadership for its steadfast and exemplary commitment to democracy and its transparent and accountable governance, which have greatly facilitated nation-building.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">The continued cooperation and good relations between Timor-Leste and its neighbours, especially Indonesia, are important not only for regional harmony but also in the larger interest of South-South cooperation. The commitment displayed by the leadership of Timor-Leste and Indonesia towards forging a harmonious, good-neighbourly relationship must find practical expression through the completion of agreements on the land border, the resolution of the problems of refugees and the provision of socio-economic opportunities for people living on either side of the border.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa11">In conclusion, I wish to join other delegations in paying special tribute to the former Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the late Sergio Vieira de Mello, and to the current Special Representative, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, for their capable and dedicated leadership. We also pay tribute to the members of UNMISET and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor for their exceptional contributions. Their actions provide a shining beacon to inspire the international community even as the United Nations continues in its effort to foster peace and development in other parts of this troubled world.</p>

	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Indonesia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jenie</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">Let me start by associating my delegation with the expression of condolences and sympathy to the delegation of the Russian Federation on the tragic loss of lives, including President Kadyrov, and the many injured in the bombing in Grozny.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">I would also like to acknowledge the presence of Senior Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, whom I thank for his important statement.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">My delegation is always pleased to participate in the Security Council's discussions on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), the present mandate of which ends in 10 days.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>), in which he observes that the relationship between Timor-Leste and Indonesia has continued to benefit from the commitment to cooperation at the highest political levels. From the very beginning, the leadership of both nations agreed to cooperate on the basis of forward-looking and reconciliatory policies -- a visionary and realistic approach that has served both nations well. It has led to peace in the area and has enabled both Timor-Leste and Indonesia to focus on development and on the best interests of their peoples.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">My delegation is of the view that the strong commitment of the national leaders of both countries to the forward-looking approach to which they have pledged themselves will be extremely useful in resolving whatever problems we face now or may face in the future. That was restated and reaffirmed by the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Timor-Leste at their meeting in Bali just a couple of days ago.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">In his report, the Secretary-General recommends to the Security Council the extension of UNMISET for a further one-year period, described as a consolidation phase, to enable the Mission to sustain, strengthen and build upon the gains made so far in Timor-Leste. My delegation has no objection whatsoever to this recommendation to the Council. Indeed, as has been the case in the past, we are delighted to offer our support to policies that will enable Timor-Leste to make the greatest possible progress in the shortest possible time.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">Indonesia, within its limited capacity as a developing country, has in a modest way contributed concretely to the economic development of Timor-Leste in various ways. Indonesia would like to urge the members of the international community, especially the developed nations, to redouble their efforts and increase their assistance to help Timor-Leste in its current economic development activities.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">There are some other issues in the report on which we would like to comment. With regard to the border issue, in paragraph 11, the report, while acknowledging the significant technical work that has been accomplished, also alluded to the fact that finalization of a border agreement, for which further input is expected from Indonesia, has remained elusive. We see that as an inaccurate and one-sided view that reflects a lack of understanding with regard to the issue.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa09">For the Council's information, the Technical Sub-Committee of Border Demarcation and Regulation, as part of the Joint Border Committee, since December 2001 has held meetings 11 times, and each meeting was preceded by a joint field survey. Indonesia has always been supportive of all activities aimed at finding a solution on the determination of borders between Indonesia and Timor-Leste and of all kinds of community activities along the border.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa10">With regard to paragraph 12, on the issue of management of the border and the regulation of economic activities, I wish to further inform the Council that there are two agreements in place: the Arrangement on Traditional Border Crossings and Regulated Markets and the Technical Arrangements on the Coordination of Measures to Facilitate the Movement of People and Their Personal Effects between the Enclave of Oecussi and Other Parts of Timor-Leste. At this stage, Indonesia is awaiting the readiness of its partner to start implementing the agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa11">With regard to paragraph 13, on the problem of the so-called former refugees, I would like first of all to restate that there have been no more Timor-Leste refugees in Indonesia since December 2002, when more than 200,000 refugees returned voluntarily to Timor-Leste. From the registration process conducted by the Government of Indonesia from August until November 2003, it is clear that there are about 125,000 East Timorese living in nine provinces and 61 regencies throughout Indonesia. Of that figure, 113 people opted to return to Timor-Leste, and the Government will render its help to them. In addition, out of the 125,000 others who live in Indonesia, 28,000 live in East Nusa Tenggara province, West Timor, but not in camps, as the report suggested. They opted to stay in Indonesia as citizens and are being offered relocation within Indonesia. However, the Government will always be ready to render its help should they voluntarily decide to return to Timor-Leste at any time.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa12">In relation to that issue, I also need to draw the Council's attention to the fact that the continued use of the term East Timorese "former refugees" is giving the wrong impression -- that there are still problems related to security. They do not pose security threats. In that regard, it should be noted that the Government of Indonesia has taken some important measures to address security matters, including the Indonesian police and armed forces sweeping for and confiscating weapons in the border area; these in turn have been destroyed by the authorities, as witnessed by UNMISET representatives. Continuous checking is conducted by the security apparatus in West Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa13">I wish also to bring to the Council's attention the fact that the outdated and unnecessary retention of the Phase 5 security situation rating in West Timor, unilaterally imposed since 2000, has prevented access by and the operations of international agencies and non-governmental agencies in this process and has hampered their humanitarian programmes. As a matter of fact, there have not been any reports of border incidents since 2001. That clearly shows that security has been improved along the border.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa14">On the issue of separated Timorese children, the Governments of Indonesia and Timor-Leste, in the absence of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, are taking full charge through their continued cooperation in order to see the issue successfully concluded in the best interests of the affected children.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa15">Finally, my delegation is confident that the Council will take into account the continued progress in the bilateral relations between Indonesia and Timor-Leste, as well as in the stable security situation along our borders, in view of the fact that since 2001 there have been no problems whatsoever in the area. As the Timor-Leste Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ramos Horta, correctly stated in his statement to the Council on 20 February 2004, "Obviously, we do not anticipate any external threat" (<i><a href="../html/S-PV-4913.html">S/PV.4913</a>, p. 21</i>).</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of New Zealand, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. MacKay</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">At the outset, may I join others in expressing our condolences to the Russian Federation on the terrorist bombing that recently occurred in Grozny.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">I would also like, at the outset, to acknowledge the presence of Senior Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto, who we are very pleased to see here in the Council Chamber today, as well as of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma, whose leadership of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) we very warmly acknowledge and appreciate. It is fitting that both of them are able to join us today as we reflect on what has been achieved in Timor-Leste and what remaining tasks lie ahead. Ambassador Sharma's goals, and those of the people serving under him, have undoubtedly contributed to a genuine, well-reciprocated partnership between the United Nations and the Government and the people of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">New Zealand strongly supports the Secretary-General's recommendation that UNMISET be extended for a further 12 months. The reduced size and modified mandate laid out in the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-333.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/333</a>) are, in our view, well judged and appropriate for a final consolidation phase.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">We are particularly satisfied with the emphasis placed on the work undertaken by the Serious Crimes Unit. This is a critical component of the United Nations Mission, and we welcome the Security Council's continued support for the principle that those who have perpetrated serious crimes shall not enjoy impunity. We commend the Serious Crimes Unit for the progress made this year and for its commitment to a strategy that will refocus resources on litigation and defence in order to work towards completion of its programme of work by 20 May 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">The resolution of outstanding justice issues is also being pursued through the parallel work of Timor-Leste's Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation, which New Zealand strongly supports and to which it has contributed 1.2 million New Zealand dollars during the past year.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa06">There are two other aspects of the most recent report of the Secretary-General that we would like to briefly mention. First, the elaboration of the security and stability component of UNMISET provides a clear and meaningful picture of its composition and tasks, and we appreciate the careful matching of capabilities to practical requirements on the ground. Secondly, the report highlights the deepening bilateral relationship between Timor-Leste and Indonesia, which was also referred to by Ambassador Jenie in the statement that he gave to the Council just a few minutes ago. The attention given by both parties to further developing this important relationship is clearly to be welcomed by us all.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa07">Finally, we commend the determination and the leadership of Timor-Leste as the United Nations Mission enters this final consolidation phase. As a regional neighbour and friend, New Zealand will continue, through multilateral and bilateral mechanisms, to support Timor-Leste's journey towards self-sufficiency.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa01">I call on the representative of Portugal.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Santa Clara Gomes</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa01">Let me join other speakers in condemning the bombing in Grozny and in presenting my condolences to the families of the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa02">I thank the Secretary-General for his latest report on the situation in Timor-Leste, as well as Special Representative Kamalesh Sharma and his staff for the excellent work they have done and for the results achieved so far. I especially thank Kamalesh Sharma, who has done an outstanding job in Dili in the past two years. I would also like to welcome the presence of Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto and her valuable contribution to this debate.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa03">Portugal subscribes to the interventions of Ireland, on behalf of the European Union, and of Brazil on behalf of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa04">Portugal welcomes the recommendation of the Secretary-General on the extension of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), in a reduced size and with a modified mandate, for a further 12-month consolidation phase in order to allow key tasks to be performed and to sustain, strengthen and build upon the gains made to date, permitting Timor-Leste to attain self-sufficiency.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa05">In this context, I welcome the proposals of the Secretary-General on a programme of support for public administration and justice; on support for the development of law enforcement; and on support for security and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa06">It is important to acknowledge the importance of continuing bilateral assistance and to underline the responsibility of the international community and of the Security Council in relation to Timor-Leste. In this context, I would just like to point out that Portugal, from 1999 to 2003, invested about 300 million in bilateral investment, development assistance programmes and technical-military assistance to Timor-Leste alone. We are ready to maintain this level of support for Timor-Leste and we encourage other countries to do the same.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa07">We note with satisfaction the steady and significant developments in the relationship of Timor-Leste with its neighbours, regarding important issues such as refugees and in the determination of land and maritime borders. We can only encourage the strengthening of these bilateral relations and the settling of all outstanding problems with neighbouring countries in a climate of friendship and trust.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa08">Finally, I would like to reiterate that, as in the past, Portugal will remain committed to the consolidation and development of Timor-Leste and to the United Nations efforts to that effect.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">I call on the representative of Australia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dauth</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">You will know, Sir, what a personal pleasure it is always for me to address the Council during your presidency.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">I want to begin like others, however, by associating Australia with the expressions of condolences extended to our friends in the Russian Federation following the appalling attack in Grozny over the weekend. It is an appalling sign of the times we live in.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">I want to begin also, as others have done, and to make a particular point of offering our congratulations and paying our tribute to the work that our former colleague and friend, Kamalesh Sharma, and his colleagues have done in East Timor in the past two years. It has been, as he himself said, good times and bad times, but at all times he has maintained the highest possible standards of professionalism, and we in Australia have very much appreciated that.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">We welcome the Security Council's readiness to adopt a draft resolution extending the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) for another year through to May 2005. In doing so, Australia congratulates the Secretary-General, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Kamalesh and his team for their excellent work in developing the follow-on UNMISET mission model.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">No one would dispute the fact that Timor-Leste has made remarkable progress in its first few years as an independent nation. That success is, of course, primarily due to the commitment and efforts of the people of Timor-Leste. Nevertheless, UNMISET has played an important supporting role. This contribution is testament not only to UNMISET personnel, but also to the continued attention of the Council, the efforts of the Secretariat and the contributions of a number of United Nations Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">In that context, the follow-on mission is a highly appropriate response to Timor-Leste's ongoing needs. The mission will help Timor-Leste consolidate the many gains that have been made and will address those gaps in capacity that are still evident. In particular, the Mission will continue to provide solid support to Timor-Leste's fledgling public administration, judicial and security institutions -- institutions critical to Timor-Leste's future.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">Australia is particularly pleased with the shape of the security sector support, with both a small peacekeeping force and a 125-member international response unit to provide backup support to Timor-Leste's security forces in emergency situations. This arrangement will provide a strong and stable security platform for Timor-Leste in the year ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">We are pleased to reiterate to the Council and to Timor-Leste that Australia will continue to provide strong support to UNMISET, including through the contribution of personnel to the peacekeeping, military liaison officer and police adviser contingents.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa09">Australia will also continue to be a major provider of bilateral development assistance to Timor-Leste. Currently, Australia is fulfilling the final year of its four-year, $150-million development pledge. Further generous assistance for coming years will shortly be announced. Consistent with our commitment to assisting Timor-Leste to develop strong and effective institutions, Australia, with assistance from the United Kingdom, will be providing a four-and-a-half year, $40-million programme of assistance to develop the capacity of Timor-Leste's police force and justice sector. Australia's significant defence cooperation programme will also continue.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa10">A number of delegations, and especially Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto -- who we, like others, very much welcome to New York today -- have referred to the importance of maritime delimitation negotiations between East Timor and both Australia and Indonesia. I need hardly say that we, too, recognize the importance of those talks. In this context, I want to remind the Council that we have already negotiated valid and generous interim arrangements, and I was pleased this morning, I have to say, to hear Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto's expression of confidence in Australia as a negotiating partner in these very important negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa11">May I conclude by restating to the Council that Australia is committed to supporting and working closely with UNMISET for the term of its renewed mandate. Australia wishes the follow-on mission every success and will actively contribute to that success.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Australia for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa02">I now call on the representative of Norway.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Løvald</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I, too, would like to associate myself with remarks made by other delegations over the very tragic loss of life in Grozny following an act of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa02">Allow me first, on behalf of the Government of Norway, to express our support for the Government of Timor-Leste, which has made significant achievements in the reconstruction, development and creation of a new nation.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa03">We welcome the report of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor. The United Nations has played a crucial role in the extraordinary political progress made by a newly independent, post-conflict Timor-Leste. However, we must not risk setbacks as a result of premature exit and we need a continued, but modified international presence, as suggested by the Secretary-General, to consolidate the achievements made.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa04">One achievement Norway would like to highlight today is that the role of women has been enhanced in Timor-Leste. According to a report from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Timor-Leste is number 22 on the ranking of countries with the highest percentage of women in national parliaments. It is fair to say that the work of the United Nations and of the Government to promote gender equality in Timor-Leste has been impressive.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa05">Norway has followed the process of prosecution and trial of those accused of serious crimes and calls for a continued fight against impunity. Furthermore, we are pleased with the work of the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation and we look forward to its final report, to be presented later this year.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa06">In addition to United Nations assistance, bilateral development assistance will also be critical in the years to come. The overall goals for Norwegian support to Timor-Leste are to assist the new State in its efforts to establish sustainable democratic institutions, to promote human rights and to combat poverty through development of a sustainable national economy. Norway remains a firm supporter of Timor-Leste and will attend the donors meeting in Dili from 17 to 19 May.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa07">Lastly, Norway would like to express its gratitude to Kamalesh Sharma, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his tireless efforts in fulfilling his tasks in Timor-Leste. The contribution of the Special Representative and that of the men and women serving with him have been nothing less than outstanding, and we commend them for the progress made.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk03-pa01">I shall now give the floor to Mr. Sharma, if he wishes to respond to any of the comments made.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sharma</span> <span class="non-nation">Special Representative of the Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk04-pa01">We have made a very serious inroad into lunchtime, and I would not like to test the apparent popularity of UNMISET by holding forth for too long. Indeed, this is not required of me any more, I feel, in the light of the statement by Senior Minister Ana Pessoa Pinto. She has given much information and clarification and important perspectives for all of us.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk04-pa02">We have noted, however, the various points that delegations have made on various issues and security concerns on the rule of law, the national police and further requirements to professionalize it, human rights, serious crime and advisors to public administration. I wish to advise the Council and the delegations that we stand ready to throw further light on any of these issues, should that be desired.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk04-pa03">I would only like to restrict myself to thanking all the delegations for their kind and complimentary words directed to myself and to members of UNMISET. I will faithfully communicate these sentiments soon after return. I am convinced that the confidence and encouragement expressed by the Council -- indeed, which I have always received -- regarding the work being done by them will further galvanize them towards realizing the Council's goals for UNMISET, particularly in this consolidation phase, should it be approved by the Council and on which virtually all members have spoken.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg031-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Sharma for those concluding remarks. Once again, on behalf of the Council, we wish him all the best in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa02">There are no further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
