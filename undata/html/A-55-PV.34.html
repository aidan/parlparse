	<div class="p">Pursuant to General Assembly decision 42/450 of 17 December 1987, the Assembly elects the members of the Committee for Programme and Coordination upon their nomination by the Economic and Social Council.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly has before it document <a href="../pdf/A-55-379">A/55/379</a>, which contains the nominations by the Economic and Social Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee that will occur as a result of the expiration on 31 December 2000 of the terms of office of the Bahamas, France, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Uganda, the United States of America and Zambia.</div>
	<div class="p">Those States are eligible for immediate re-election.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to remind members that after 1 January 2001 the following States will still be members of the Committee: Argentina, Bangladesh, Benin, Brazil, Cameroon, China, the Comoros, Cuba, Egypt, Gabon, Germany, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Japan, Mauritania, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. Therefore, those 27 States are not eligible in this election.</div>
	<div class="p">I should now like to inform members that the following States have been nominated by the Economic and Social Council.</div>
	<div class="p">The two African States for two vacancies are Botswana and the United Republic of Tanzania. The one Eastern European State for one vacancy is the Russian Federation. The two Latin American and Caribbean States for two vacancies are the Bahamas and Mexico. The two Western European and other States for two vacancies are France and the United States of America.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with rule<i>  </i>92 of the rules of procedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot and there shall be no nominations. I should like to recall paragraph 16 of decision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing with the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs when the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled should become standard, unless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a given election.</div>
	<div class="p">In the absence of such a request, may I take it that the Assembly decides to proceed to the election on that basis?</div>
