</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Løj</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01"> In my capacity as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), I would like to brief the Security Council on the activities of the Committee over the past three months and to submit to the Security Council the Committee's sixteenth work programme, covering the period from 1 July to 30 September 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">During the first three months of my chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, focus has been on the following. First, dialogue with States has continued to develop through visits to States and through intensified discussions with States about implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and reporting thereon. Secondly, we have strengthened our methodology for the identification of States' needs for technical assistance. Thirdly, we have embarked on a discussion on how to ensure clarity and transparency in promoting implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> through the development of a set of so-called best practices. Finally, I should inform members that the fact that the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED) is still not fully staffed and operational has continued to have an impact on the Committee's capacity to deliver an ambitious work programme. However, we expect the Executive Directorate to be at full capacity before the end of the period covering the current work programme.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Before going into more detail, I should like to thank the Executive Director of CTED, Mr. Javier Rupérez, and his team, as well as the Secretariat staff, for the valuable support they have provided the CTC over the past three months.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">As mandated by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, the CTC, through its CTED, has conducted three more visits to States, with their consent. CTED visited Kenya in May, and both Albania and Thailand in June. I would like to thank the Governments of those visited States for their hospitality, cooperation and willingness to discuss with the delegation issues related to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in such an open manner.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The three visits certainly provided the Committee with a more thorough understanding of the situation in those countries, including steps already taken by those Governments to implement the resolution and their commitment to doing so. The Committee now has further insight into the difficulties States may face while seeking to ensure full implementation. I would like to stress that it is of high priority to ensure proper follow-up to those visits. To that end, the CTC is committed to ensuring that technical assistance needs identified during the visits are met.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that the purpose of those visits is to provide an opportunity to "engage in a detailed discussion to monitor implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>" (<i><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, tenth preambular paragraph</i>). Deepening the CTC's relationship with States through a visit is considered carefully by the CTC with the State concerned, considering States that are already engaged in the fight against terrorism and are in the process of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and where the Committee would like to offer further analysis and, if necessary, assistance to help the State further its implementation of the provisions of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The visits have been conducted with the participation of representatives of relevant international and regional organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization, Interpol, the World Customs Organization, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Such cooperation has been essential in providing the necessary expertise in all the areas of the resolution and has been of great importance to the success of the visits. I would like to thank those organizations for providing members to the expert teams that went on those visits and express the hope of the Committee that such cooperation will only be further enhanced in the time to come.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">The CTC regards those visits as an essential addition to its dialogue with States about implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is the Committee's intention to continue those visits, with the consent of the States to be visited and to the extent the available resources allow.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Dialogue with States has also intensified on issues such as late submission of reports and needs for technical assistance. The Committee, including through its CTED, continues to provide general guidance on implementation. As of 30 June 2005, the Committee had received 601 reports and many States are about to submit their fifth report. Still, a number of States have difficulties submitting the reports in a timely manner. At the moment, 67 States are behind in their reporting to the Committee. Over the past three months, the Committee has made a special effort to discuss issues related to reporting with representatives of States late in submitting their reports to the Committee. I would like to thank the representatives of those States for their willingness to discuss, in such an open manner, whatever difficulties they are facing.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">The Committee is aware that the problems pertain, to a great extent, to lack of capacity, as well as so-called reporting fatigue. In the months to come, the CTC will continue discussions with States about how the Committee can best help them in ensuring timely reporting to the Committee, as well as full implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In the meantime, I strongly encourage States to report to the CTC, since it is of the utmost importance that there be regular contact between the Committee and States. Also, the Committee will continue discussions with the other two Committees reporting today on how we can best address issues relating to reporting in a coordinated manner.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">As I mentioned earlier, the Committee has continued its discussions on how to facilitate technical assistance. In order to ensure a comprehensive approach to each State's implementation of the provisions of the resolution and identification of needs for technical assistance, the Committee has decided that it will take further steps to identify needs for assistance in the process of evaluating States' reports. As a result, States may, from now on, receive a letter from the Committee that will include advice on how to further implement the provisions and, as a part thereof, the Committee's suggestions regarding areas in which technical assistance might be sought. The Committee strongly encourages States that might benefit from assistance to request such assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">The Committee will continue its discussions on how to facilitate the meeting of requests, including by further developing cooperation with potential donors broadly. Therefore, the CTC also encourages potential donors to continue to update the Committee on assistance offers, as well as assistance provided, in order to match identified needs with potential donors.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">Finally, the Committee has considered the need to provide clarity and transparency on what it takes to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In that regard, the Committee has discussed the usefulness of developing sets of best practices to provide guidance to States on implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Over the next month, the Committee will continue that discussion on how best to provide the desired clarity and transparency through sets of best practices. The Committee welcomes the work already done in that field by international, regional and subregional organizations and encourages relevant organizations to continue to develop sets of best practices to provide guidance to their respective member States on how to implement the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">Before I conclude, I would like to say a few more words about the tasks that are ahead for the Committee. They are spelled out in greater detail in the sixteenth work programme of the Committee, which is before members in the annex to <a href="../pdf/S-2005-421.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/421</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">Most important, the Committee is looking forward to a fully staffed and operational CTED working under the policy guidance of the Committee. Staff members have started to take up their new positions, and a key task during the next three months is to ensure the adjustment and training of the new CTED staff. An operational CTED will allow the Committee to catch up on the unfortunate backlog of reports from States that has been developing in the transitional period. That is a key priority for the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">Moreover, the Committee will continue to strengthen its dialogue with States on issues related to the implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, especially in order to ensure thorough identification of needs for technical assistance. In that regard, the Committee will also make a special effort to strengthen its cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">The CTC remains a crucial instrument of the international community in its fight against terrorism -- an instrument based on dialogue and assistance to States. Its task remains vital and urgent. The support of Member States remains crucially important, and the Committee is grateful for the support it has received. We will continue to count on such support in the future.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Løj for her briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">I now give the floor to Ambassador César Mayoral, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mayoral</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">This is the briefing that it is my duty to present every 120 days in conformity with paragraph 12 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1526 (2004)</a>. Sadly, it seems that, too often, when we brief the Council, we have to begin by lamenting the losses caused by new heinous acts of terrorism. Unfortunately, this time is no exception. The attacks perpetrated in London on 7 July were a new indication of the threats to peace and security caused by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">There can be no doubt that the threat posed by Al-Qaida is radically different from the threat it posed when this sanctions regime was first imposed. It is believed that Al-Qaida terrorism now comprises three separate but interlinked groups: first is the old leadership, whose names are known to everyone; second are the fighters who were trained in camps in Afghanistan and graduated as expert terrorists; and third is a new and growing generation of followers who, although they may never have left their countries of residence, have embraced the core elements of the Al-Qaida message. Given that the Committee is devoting increasing attention to the third group, I wish to encourage the Council to make clear to Member States that the word "associated" must also cover such groups so that the sanctions regime can be adapted to the new threats.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">The Council is currently considering a new draft resolution aimed at intensifying the sanctions measures. I believe that it provides the Council with an opportunity to strengthen a number of elements and to address some of the concerns expressed by Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">I now turn to the activities of the Committee and of its Analytical Support and Sanctions the Monitoring Team. The Committee has met 10 times since I last briefed the Council. Half of those meetings were formal. The Council will recall that on 10 January, the Committee heard a report by the United States delegation and that at the time, I encouraged other Member States to avail themselves of the same opportunity. I am now pleased to report that since then, we have heard very useful reports presented by the delegations of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Australia. The Committee has often stressed the importance of such meetings. Once again, I would like to encourage States to take the opportunity to share national achievements and concerns related to the fight against Al-Qaida and the Taliban. The Committee also met with Mr. Gijs de Vries, European Union Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, who explained the European Union's competencies and activities in the area of counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">During the reporting period, I made my first visits to selected countries. I was accompanied by Minister Panga of Tanzania, First Counsellor Andreades of Greece and Counsellor Hafrad of Algeria. We had very useful and informative meetings in Germany, the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey and with European Union institutions in Brussels. I was pleased to note that in those places there is a wish to contribute to the effective implementation of the sanctions measures and to address with useful candour certain concerns with respect to the quality of the Committee's list of individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaida and the Taliban and to due-process guarantees.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">I should also like to report that the Monitoring Team has continued to provide essential support to the work of the Committee. Here, I wish to thank Mr. Richard Barrett and his Team for their highly professional work. The Team's third report is now being translated and should be available to all members early next month. The Committee will consider it in detail in the weeks to come. I believe that the report, which contains a number of useful clarifications, will be very valuable to all Security Council members and to the broader United Nations membership. The Team has also helped the Committee to prepare its assessment of the implementation of measures, which the Committee will submit to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Members of the Team recently travelled to, among other places, the Sudan and Afghanistan to assess the implementation of sanctions measures by those countries. The Team has also continued to coordinate its work with other relevant bodies, including the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, in an exemplary manner.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">One of the important recommendations in the Team's second report was to increase cooperation between the Committee and Interpol. As a direct result of this recommendation, I have sought the Secretary-General's assistance in formulating an agreement to complement the existing cooperation agreement with Interpol to broaden and deepen the cooperation. It is my understanding that the Secretariat and Interpol are now working on the development of such an agreement, which will be a very positive step forward.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">As to the future activities of the Committee, I firmly believe that the new resolution to be adopted by the Security Council this month will provide the Committee with the new impetus to deal with some of the most pressing issues on the Committee's agenda. There are many issues that the Committee will have to deal with in the next six months, including a new visit by the Chairman to selected Member States, the analysis of the third report of the Monitoring Team and the updating of the Committee's guidelines.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">I should like briefly to point to two aspects where, in my opinion, Member States and the Committee must strive for further improvement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">First, it has become clear that some Member States have encountered difficulties or need assistance in the implementation of the sanctions measures, particularly with regard to the assets freeze. For example, it emerges from the reports of some Member States that there is apparently still a need to present sufficient evidence to judicial authorities as a condition of the freezing of assets. We wish to clarify that such systems are not in conformity with Member States' obligations under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. For this reason, I urge States to ensure that assets can be frozen as soon as the Committee adds the name of an individual or an entity to the Committee's list.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">Secondly, many Member States have argued that the Committee should further improve procedures for listing and delisting names. The Committee will continue to address such concerns. During my visits to selected States, and through reports to the Committee, it has become very clear that more is expected from the Committee in terms of the quality of information used for identification. I urge Member States to continue to provide additional information regarding individuals already on the lists, as this will certainly improve the application of sanctions.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">In recent months the Committee has also received a number of communications regarding the inclusion of certain individuals and entities on its list. This is a very positive development, and I wish to express here that the Committee highly appreciates it. The Committee is still considering some of these submissions and will again strongly urge Member States to submit further names.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">I now come to our conclusions. There is, sadly, every chance that Al-Qaida will continue to menace the world for some time to come. The international community must firmly oppose this threat and maintain a system that puts pressure on Al-Qaida by creating an environment hostile to it through effective application implementation of sanctions on a global scale. In this regard, I expect the forthcoming resolution to provide the Committee with a strong mandate to pursue these goals, while at the same time ensuring that due process concerns are addressed in an appropriate manner.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to Ambassador Mihnea Ioan Motoc, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01"> I have the honour to brief, in turn, the Security Council on progress achieved by the 1540 Committee in its work since 26 April 2005 and to introduce the Committee's second programme of work, for the period 1 July to 30 September 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">I shall speak first of the examination of national reports. At the first joint briefing, which took place on 25 April 2005, I informed the Security Council that the 1540 Committee had entered the substantive stage of its work and had begun examining national reports with a view to monitoring States' implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>. The Committee, with the support of its experts, has already examined more than 50 national reports, as indicated in the first programme of work. All information contained in the first national reports examined by the Committee has been summarized in the form of a matrix that reflects provisions of the resolution. Additional information identified by the Committee in the official public data provided by States to the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and other international organizations on steps they have taken in the areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> has also been included in the matrix.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">On the basis of this examination, and for the purpose of completing its knowledge of the steps States have taken, or intend to take, in responding to the obligations set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, the Committee is reaching out to reporting States with a view to soliciting additional information or to seeking clarification in areas covered by their first reports. The letters requesting additional information and/or clarification have been addressed to the Missions in New York. In the spirit of transparency, the Committee decided to share the matrix with reporting States.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">The Committee is determined to pursue the examination of first national reports in an accelerated manner. Our work is now supported by a group of eight experts, and I am confident that the goal of completing the examination of first-round country reports could be attained by October 2005. Based on additional information that we hope will be provided by States in response to the Committee's letters and matrices, the Committee will continue to monitor and facilitate the efforts undertaken by all States to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">Insofar as reporting is concerned, by April 2006 the Committee will have to provide sufficient information to enable the Security Council to assess the progress States have made in implementing the resolution. The Committee can properly fulfil its mandate if all States report to it, as the Council has called upon them to do. Without information the Committee will not be able to present the Council a comprehensive picture regarding measures put in place or planned by all States to implement the provisions of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">As of today, 118 States have submitted reports to the Committee. We welcome the fact that the majority of United Nations Member States have presented information about their domestic non-proliferation provisions, including their contributions to international cooperation in this field. However, 74 Member States have yet to report.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">I would like to take this opportunity to renew my call upon those that have not yet done so to submit their reports without delay. We recognize that some States may encounter administrative difficulties in reporting. Nevertheless, we would be grateful if they could so inform the Committee, which would facilitate assistance to them in complying with the reporting requirements.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">Other States might consider that they have nothing to report, because they possess neither weapons of mass destruction nor the capacity to develop such weapons or related materials. However, there are other ways in which non-State actors might seek to exploit their territories, by using them for the transit of goods, for the financing of illegal activities or as a base to broker the sale of goods related to weapons of mass destruction in other countries.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">Recent events have shown that no one is shielded from those threats. States should be aware that unless they meet their obligations in full by enacting and enforcing national, legal and regulatory measures and by committing themselves to international cooperation on non-proliferation, their territories could be exploited in the worst possible way.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">We realize that fully implementing the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> in many States is a long-term project, but the Committee is fully committed to supporting that work, which must start now. A full report to the Committee can kick-start the process of assistance. As Chairman of the 1540 Committee, I will continue to raise the issue of further reporting through the outreach activities that the Committee intends to conduct in the near future. We will continue to talk to all countries that have yet to report. The Committee is also considering the possibility of reaching out to Member States through international and regional organizations. Regional seminars and workshops aimed at raising awareness of the problem worldwide and facilitating further reporting are also envisaged. I am very encouraged that the issue of improving reporting performance and late submissions will be considered in a coordinated manner by our committees.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">In considering national reports, the 1540 Committee has already identified both needs and offers of assistance. We are encouraged by the fact that many countries are already helping by providing expertise and advice to Member States lacking the knowledge, the experience or the resources to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">In addition, the offers of assistance contained in the first national reports were summarized and presented to all States. The Committee indicated the areas in which assistance could be provided by a specific country, as well as the way in which contacts for assistance could be established on a bilateral basis. The Committee will continue to develop its work in this area, including the possibility of acting as a clearing house on the issue of assistance. We stand ready to consider all requests from States seeking help in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> and to facilitate contacts with donor countries and organizations. As an additional measure, the Committee has appointed a coordinator among the experts, who will manage assistance-related issues with the support of the Department for Disarmament Affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa13">Full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> by all States is a long-term objective that, obviously, goes beyond the current mandate of the Committee. It will require continuous efforts at the national, regional and international levels on capacity-building and assistance, as well as monitoring and measuring the progress made by States in implementing the resolution. I am confident that the Security Council will consider how best to ensure that the work of the Committee makes an enduring contribution to non-proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa14">With respect to interaction with international organizations, the Committee has continued its interaction with the IAEA and the OPCW on ways in which those organizations can support our work and contribute to the process of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>. As the process of examining national reports continues, the Committee will interact and cooperate as appropriate with the relevant international, regional and subregional organizations in order to facilitate the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>. Working relationships with those organizations are being developed as appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa15">In the same vein, the 1540 Committee will maintain close cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions Committee, as envisaged in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> and in the 25 April 2005 statement by the President of the Security Council (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-16.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/16</a>). The Committee's experts will work closely with the experts of the other committees, making every effort to maximize synergies among the experts of all the committees.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa16">Transparency will remain a hallmark of the work of the 1540 Committee. The Chairman and the Vice-Chairmen will reach out on a regular basis to United Nations Member States. That will include work with the United Nations media, including through joint briefings with the Chairs of the CTC and the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee. The 1540 Committee will continue to update its dedicated website, as an additional source of information on issues related to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>. A separate entry on assistance will soon be added to that website.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa17">The Committee will also continue its practice of informing organizations outside the United Nations about our work through attendance at international, regional and subregional meetings and conferences. I will make full use of those opportunities to address, in particular, the issues of further reporting and assistance. As I did last April, I now call on all Member States to designate contact points for <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> both in New York and in their capitals and to make direct contact with the Committee's members and its experts on matters related to that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa18">On behalf of the Committee, I look forward to the cooperation of all States as the Committee goes forward with its work in the months ahead.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Motoc for his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Babadoudou</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">My delegation would like to thank Ambassador Løj of Denmark, Ambassador Mayoral of Argentina and Ambassador Motoc of Romania for their briefings to the Council on the activities of the committees whose work they have the heavy responsibility of conducting. I also express my great appreciation to the various teams of experts that provide technical support for the Committees' activities as they carry out their mandates.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, terrorism has emerged as one of the major scourges of our time. Through its various manifestations, terrorism has demonstrated the scope of the threat it poses to international peace and security. Terrorism is a crime against humanity. It threatens the lives of innocent civilians. It exacerbates the divisions between civilizations and between religions. In doing so, it greatly undermines the fundamental values of today's world, in particular human dignity.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Today's public meeting is being held a short time after the attacks in London. We take this opportunity to reiterate our condolences to the families of the victims and to reaffirm our firm condemnation of the phenomenon.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">The fight against terrorism requires the mobilization of all States. We must therefore continue to pool our resources and efforts to protect our populations from that threat. In that context, the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and its Executive Directorate, the 1267 Committee and the 1540 Committee provide a framework for coordination and a driving force for international cooperation aimed at enabling our States gradually to put in place and strengthen the appropriate legal, institutional and operational framework for the effective implementation of the measures set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Let us recall that that these measures relate primarily to controlling flows of funds, the trans-border activities of groups or individuals associated with terrorist entities, and the flow of arms and other sensitive products, with the goal of cutting off financing of terrorist activities, inhibiting the movement of terrorists and denying them access to weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">It is extremely important that these measures be implemented consistently. With respect specifically to weapons of mass destruction, it is urgent, in order to prevent their acquisition by terrorists, to institute, for example, strict controls on the movement of dual-use chemical components and other sensitive materials needed for their development. In addition, all States must understand the need to do so and take appropriate measures in that respect. We encourage the 1540 Committee to undertake an outreach effort with respect to the resolution to raise the awareness of all States, in particular those that do not feel that they are affected by its provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">The 1267 Committee, for its part, must, in the exercise of its mandate, continue to enhance its working methods by defining clear rules and principles for managing the list of terrorist individuals and entities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">The entire machinery established by the United Nations to fight terrorism must continue its resolute efforts to assess, on an ongoing basis, the efforts undertaken by States in order to help them build their capacities to meet their international obligations and to increase the effectiveness of their actions in the fight against terrorism. Indeed, the arsenal for that fight must become fully functional and enable States to prevent terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">To that end, my delegation firmly supports the holding of a constructive dialogue with Member States in order methodically to determine their technical assistance needs and to promote international cooperation so that they can receive the necessary assistance. In that connection, visits to States, with the involvement of regional organizations, are extremely useful, because they make it possible to enhance such a dialogue on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">We also encourage increased cooperation among the various committees in the implementation of their quarterly work programmes as well as the sharing of information and experiences among them, given the significant contribution that such efforts can make to enhancing the consistency of United Nations action and to developing a set of best practices in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">My delegation advocates universal accession to the various conventions and protocols related to terrorism. Those States that have done so must take the appropriate measures to meet their international commitments in the fight against terrorism, including the submission of periodic reports.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa12">In that regard, reflection must be undertaken on how to streamline the process of requesting States' reports so that a consolidated report can be produced relating to their obligations under the various Security Council resolutions on terrorism. We believe that this is an urgent task for the expert groups of the three Committees.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa13">Above and beyond all of those actions, we believe, and will continue to say as much, that the international community must deal with and address racial inequality, injustice, underdevelopment and conflict, because such systemic dysfunctions contribute to violence and extremism. Solutions need to be found in order to deny terrorism its breeding grounds. In that respect, we welcome the recent decisions of the Group of 8 and the various measures undertaken within the framework of United Nations reform to enhance the effectiveness of the action of the international community in the fight against terrorism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I should like now to address the Council in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">First, Romania fully supports the European Union statement, to be delivered later by our colleague, Sir Emyr Jones Parry. In addition, I wish to make the following specific brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Romania welcomes the emerging practice whereby the Council hears regular briefings by its three counter-terrorism Committees. As the Council is thus resolutely pursuing, in a synergetic manner, its endeavours against terrorism, the three Committees and their Chairpersons are increasingly reaching out to each other, as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>. This is a good opportunity for me to commend not only the dedicated work of my Danish and Argentine peers, who are presiding over the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, respectively, but also the friendly and collegiate easiness with which we can share at all times our own experiences and evaluations, and envisage ways to further strengthen Security Council action in the area of counter-terrorism and non-proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Recent events have reminded us that terrorism is alive and well and that no one is safe from its ugly spectre; now more than ever we have to ensure that terrorists are denied access to weapons of mass destruction and related materials. The fact that there seems to be increasing interaction among terrorists is a solid additional reason for us to increasingly join forces and to pool all of the resources that those who support freedom and safety for everyone are able to muster.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Action at the global level, including that of the three subsidiary bodies of the Security Council -- the "borderless committees" -- is extremely valuable in laying down the broad outlines of a universal shield against terrorism. However, this requires, first and foremost, committed efforts on the part of each State. Every Member of the United Nations should be supported in developing at least minimal defence capacities and adequate response capabilities in the face of terrorist threats. The protection both of States and individuals is, ultimately, a national function and responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">Many States require, for what is assuredly the long haul, technical assistance for capacity-building in this area involving significant changes in domestic threat perception, security strategies, legislation and enforcement. We must work relentlessly so that the Security Council can improve its capacity to facilitate such assistance and, where appropriate, develop its own set of tools in this field. Many valuable ideas along those lines were recently put forward at the annual informal retreat of members of the Security Council with the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">My delegation supports a continuing review of the performance of the subsidiary bodies established by the Council to address the scourge of terrorism, as well as an early process of reflection on how the respective regimes put in place in recent years could be further improved and consolidated, in the light not only of lessons learned but of the continuous escalation of terrorist activities around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">Romania hopes that renewed political guidance in this field will be given at the highest levels by our leaders when they gather in New York in September. In that regard, we welcome the recent proposals made by Norway aimed at providing more substantial content with respect to the relevant paragraphs of the draft outcome document for the summit. Romania, along with Member States from all regions of the globe, fully supports Oslo's bold and timely initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">The anti-terrorism effort must be a comprehensive, system-wide undertaking on the part of the United Nations system as a whole. It cannot be fully sustained only by action taken at the Security Council level. The recent measures taken by the Secretary-General to set up a counter-terrorism interdepartmental task force within the Secretariat sets a good example in terms of fostering greater synergy and coordination among the many valuable contributions each sector is making in the global fight against the ominous threats of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">Let me take this opportunity to commend the various branches of the Secretariat, in particular those within the Department of Political Affairs and the Department for Disarmament Affairs, that are providing valuable support to the work of the three Committees. We hope that the Secretariat will continue its valuable efforts to support work in the field of anti-terrorism with the sense of urgency and priority that this threat is constantly bringing home to our constituencies.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa11">The groups of experts that are assisting the three Committees in their activities are doing a fine job, and this is a good occasion for us to commend them for their professionalism and dedication to the cause. National and global anti-terrorism preparedness cannot substitute for action at the regional and subregional levels. The Security Council itself and, in particular, its anti-terrorism community will have a good opportunity, on the occasion of the upcoming high-level meeting of the Secretary-General with heads of regional partner organizations, to pass on a strong message on the need for mutual engagement against global terrorism and the proliferation of WMDs.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa12">Beyond their differing mandates, the three committees share common concerns, challenges and strengths. It is therefore necessary to ensure that their work is guided towards ensuring a coherent effort by the Council and is translated into a joint pool of expertise and knowledge. Establishment of a unified database would help the committees accomplish their monitoring mandates, and it would also help Member States to pursue effectively the implementation of Security Council resolutions while avoiding duplication and overlap. It could also help address the issue of reporting fatigue, which has been raised for some time in our debates.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa13">Transparency has to remain a hallmark of our work. But it should work both ways. The Security Council and its committees have to inform the general membership regularly on progress achieved and on shortcomings identified in their work. For their part, Member States should provide the Security Council with comprehensive information and feedback on their implementation efforts. The committees cannot perform their mandates properly if national reporting requirements are not adequately met. Without information, the Council cannot assess what has been done so far in terms of implementation and what additional measures are needed to improve our common defences against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa14">In a final reference to the work I am directly responsible for, let me say that the figure 15-40 is a tennis score that indicates a situation on the edge for the side that is serving. The international community is now facing a similarly worrying situation in the face of increasing terrorism and greater possibilities for the illegitimate proliferation of WMDs. It has therefore to serve hard and to serve effectively in order to take the game.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cheng Jingye</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">The Chinese delegation thanks Ambassadors Løj, Mayoral and Motoc for their briefings on the work of their respective committees and on their plans for the next phase of their activities. We thank them for their great efforts to facilitate the work of the three committees. Let me also commend the new Danish chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee for the great deal of fine work it has done.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">We take this opportunity strongly to condemn the terrorist attacks that recently took place in London. Our condolences go to the victims and their families. That incident shows once again that much remains to be done in the fight against international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">I shall now make some remarks on the work of the three committees. As subsidiary bodies of the Security Council, the 1267 Committee, the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the 1540 Committee play a unique and important role in the global fight against terrorism. We continue to urge the committees to strengthen their coordination and cooperation in the gathering and sharing of information. Each of the committees' monitoring groups, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate and the various groups of experts should have its own focus based on its particular mandate and purview. At the same time, horizontal exchanges should be enhanced in the interest of efficiency and avoiding duplication. The committees should also coordinate their activities with respect to the review of country reports and should learn from each others' successful experiences. The three committees should continue to strengthen their dialogue and cooperation with relevant international and regional organizations and with institutions within the United Nations family in order to enhance cooperation in the global fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">China attaches great importance to the 1267 Committee because of its central role in countering Al-Qaida, the Taliban and associated individuals and entities. Consultations on and the adoption of a new resolution will be important for the work of the Committee in the near future. We hope that the resolution will consolidate the consensus recently forged among all parties on improving the quality of the comprehensive list, enhancing sanctions measures and encouraging more Members to submit lists.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">China looks forward to the full functioning of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) Executive Directorate. We hope that, with the support of a highly efficient and fully staffed Directorate with its work proceeding along the proper lines, the Committee will make additional achievements. On the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions, China will continue to participate actively in the CTC's discussions on the formulation of best practices with respect to financing the fight against terrorism, with a view to reaching consensus and helping Member States in their implementation of the Council's resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">China is pleased to note that the work of the 1540 Committee is proceeding smoothly. We believe that the Committee's priority for the next phase of its work should be to continue its serious and objective consideration of country reports and to urge countries that have not yet submitted reports to do so as soon as possible. The Committee should also provide countries with the assistance they need with respect to the implementation of Council resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">China stands resolutely against terrorism in all its forms. We will work actively with all other countries and will be highly vigilant at all times. We will enhance our anti-terrorism cooperation and will continue to make unremitting efforts to eradicate terrorism. We will also continue to participate actively in the work of the three committees and will work with all parties concerned to facilitate the complete and effective implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I have the honour also to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, the candidate countries Turkey and Croatia, the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, the members of the European Economic Area Iceland and Norway, as well as Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, also align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">I would like to thank the three committee Chairpersons for their briefings.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Each time the Council meets to hear the briefings of the Chairs of these committees, we say that the scourge of terrorism is still with us. That is not a platitude; it is a grim reality. Recent events in the United Kingdom, in Turkey and across the Middle East are a tragic reminder of the ongoing security challenges being faced around the world. This is an issue that affects us all. Our condemnation of these attacks has been unequivocal, and our message has been clear: terrorists who seek to use violence to impose their views will not succeed.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The European Union will continue to support the United Nations in its counter-terrorism efforts. In the context of the upcoming September summit, the EU attaches importance to including strong language in the outcome document which condemns terrorism. We remain fully committed to the implementation of the EU Action Plan on Combating Terrorism. Moreover, for our part, the EU is looking actively at this counter-terrorism framework to establish if and where additional measures are necessary. We intend to complete that review by December 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Turning to the work of the 1267 Committee, we appreciate the visits Ambassador Mayoral has undertaken in his capacity as Chair of the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. EU officials were particularly pleased to meet with the Ambassador and his delegation during their recent visit to Brussels. Members of the EU, in this case the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, volunteered to meet with the Committee to discuss their respective national implementation of measures under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. The EU's anti-terrorism coordinator, Mr. Gijs de Vries, also briefed the 1267 Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) on the work being undertaken against terrorism by the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">The EU would also like to commend the work of the 1267 Committee's Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team. We hope to receive its third report imminently and we look forward to the Team's mandate being extended in the forthcoming new draft resolution. In the context of that draft resolution, the EU would like to emphasize its and other States' well-known position on the importance of respect for human rights in all counter-terrorism policies. A greater degree of transparency would be welcome, as would the provision of clearer guidance on listing, de-listing and humanitarian exemptions.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">With regard to the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Union remains fully committed to the obligations set out under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and continues to work to ensure that they are fully implemented. We were particularly pleased to be able to participate in the recent visits of the CTC Executive Directorate to Albania, Kenya and Morocco. We look forward to building on that cooperation. The arrival of additional experts for the Directorate is a positive step. We welcome the work that the Directorate is already doing and we look forward to seeing the Directorate as a whole becoming fully operational as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">Turning to the 1540 Committee, the arrival of additional experts to work with the Committee is welcome news. We are pleased to see from the work programme that all of the first national reports from countries will be examined in the period covered by the work programme. While we are pleased to note that so many Member States have now submitted their first reports to the 1540 Committee, we urge the remaining States that have not done so to do likewise. The failure to supply reports will only serve to undermine the Committee's efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">The European Union will play a full role in the area of technical assistance in the context of all three committees. The EU will reinforce our work with priority third countries, through increasing individual collective commitments to technical assistance and capacity-building, and we will endeavour to support them, including in the area of countering radicalization and terrorist financing.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">The EU welcomes the ongoing cooperation among the three committees and their experts. We very much want to see that continue.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa11">I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate the European Union's full support for the Secretary-General's proposals to establish a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy for the United Nations. We therefore welcome the decision by the Commission on Human Rights to appoint a special rapporteur to provide guidance and advice to States on ensuring that counter-terrorism efforts are in line with international human rights law. We hope that decision will be ratified by the Economic and Social Council in the coming days.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa12">The Union welcomes the agreement reached in the General Assembly on 13 April 2005 on the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-59-290.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 59/290</a>). We call on all Members of the United Nations to sign the Convention during the summit to be held in September. We attach great and particular importance to the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. We will work towards the goal of its adoption during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kitaoka</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I would like to welcome the Chairpersons of the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions Committee, the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the 1540 Committee, as well as to express my appreciation for their briefings.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">First of all, my delegation would like to express its sincere condolences to the families of the victims of the simultaneous terrorist bombings that took place in London on 7 July. We also express our hope for the early recovery of those who suffered injuries. As in the case of the Madrid train bombings and the sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway network, innocent lives were taken by the targeting of mass transit systems for terror attacks, which is surely the most reprehensible act imaginable.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">As is evident from the London terrorist bombings, terrorism continues to pose an immediate threat to all of us, as does the risk of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery falling into terrorist hands. The Security Council has been working in earnest to cope with such threats. Following the Council's meeting on this subject in April (see <a href="../html/S-PV-5168.html">S/PV.5168</a>), it is extremely meaningful that the Chairpersons of the three Committees have today provided clear explanations of the work done by their respective committees and experts and have described the programmes of the Security Council as a whole that are devoted to the common task of fighting terrorism. Deepening the cooperation among those committees will ensure the development of an effective counter-terrorism policy.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">I would like to emphasize four points that may help to further advance the work of the three committees.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">First, it has become clear once again from the London terrorist bombings that it is of the utmost importance to urgently establish preventive measures to counter terrorism. Enhancing information-sharing and cooperation is one such measure. In addition to bilateral arrangements, it is important that the Security Council encourage Member States to utilize the information and experience accumulated by bodies such as the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), the International Civil Aviation Organization and the Financial Action Task Force. Such efforts will enable States to deny entry to terrorists by sharing information on lost or stolen passports, as well as to suppress terrorist financing.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">Secondly, it is of course also crucial to build the capacity of Member States in this regard. The CTC has finished its first round of country visits, which began in March this year. Japan regards such visits as useful in building the capacity of the States visited. My Government expects that the CTC will encourage the efforts of the States visited and will identify the areas where assistance from the international community is needed, thereby facilitating the actual provision of assistance and effectively achieving the intended objectives. In that connection, we will closely observe the progress made by the end of this year. Information regarding the assistance needs of Member States provided to the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions Committee and the 1540 Committee must be shared with the CTC. Japan will continue to provide bilateral assistance for capacity-building.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">Thirdly, in order to prevent the proliferation of terrorists and terrorist acts, improving and strengthening sanctions measures continues to be necessary. In that connection, as a result of the discussion currently taking place with regard to the new draft resolution on the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions Committee, my Government expects that we will soon be able to decide on ways to improve and strengthen sanction measures -- for example, by establishing clearer procedures so that the Committee's consolidated list will be easier for Member States to use, strengthening cooperation between the Committee and Interpol and setting up a system to effectively implement asset-freezing measures. In that connection, Japan appreciates the reports prepared by the 1267 Committee's Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team. We are certain that, in conjunction with today's discussion, the reports will contribute greatly to improving and strengthening sanctions measures.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">Fourthly, in the fight against terrorism, the full cooperation of Member States in the efforts of the United Nations is, after all, indispensable. As underscored on various other occasions, Japan would like to urge Member States to join and implement the 12 counter-terrorism-related international conventions and protocols as a matter of urgency and to sign the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in its early stage. At the same time, it is essential for the international community to clearly state that the targeting and deliberate killing of civilians and non-combatants cannot be justified or legitimized by any cause or grievance, and to cooperate in concluding the negotiation of the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism by June 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">Although it takes time and is a difficult task to prepare domestic legislation and measures to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a> and other relevant resolutions, the sound way to counter terrorism is to continue to make steady progress in such preparations. The Security Council will continue to strive to make provision for an effective mechanism for counter-terrorism policy and to ensure that necessary assistance be provided to those Member States requiring and requesting it. To facilitate that, cooperation, such as the submission of reports without delay and the provision of information to each Committee, is essential.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">No State, whether developed or developing, is exempt from the threat of terrorism. Every State is constantly studying ways to enable its people to live in a safe world, and the United Nations is at the forefront of gathering and sharing the accumulated knowledge and experience of Member States in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">Japan supports Secretary-General Annan's recommendation to implement a comprehensive strategy for counter-terrorism. My Government expects that all heads of State will accept the Secretary-General's recommendation at the summit meeting in September. In addition, in order to further strengthen the actions taken by the Security Council, my Government will continue to extend its full cooperation to the work of the three Committees.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">This is our first public meeting on terrorism after the tragic events in London reminded us once again of that scourge, as well as of the urgency and necessity of redoubling efforts to combat it.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Within the framework of the reform of the United Nations, we now have the opportunity to reach an agreement on a definition of terrorism and to foster a coordinated, comprehensive and integrated international response to that threat. We welcome the suggestions presented by the Secretary-General and consider them to be a good basis for a larger discussion about that issue.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">A comprehensive anti-terrorism strategy should also tackle, in a proper manner, the root causes of terrorism as a most appropriate way of reducing the temptations to resort to that form of violence. Among possible techniques, such a strategy might involve preventive diplomacy, crisis management and the promotion of social and economic development. It is well known that situations linked to political, cultural and social oppression foster an environment that facilitates the development of extremism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">I should like to add our voice to the Secretary-General's call in inviting United Nations Member States to make a special effort to try to conclude the needed convention on terrorism as soon as possible. That convention should take into account the observance of international law, the rule of law and due process. We consider that the ideas put forward by the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change are a useful starting point for that process. Brazil believes that such an umbrella convention should be based on a clear and agreed definition of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">We thank Ambassador Ellen Løj for her substantive briefing and for her effective and dynamic conduct of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED), Mr. Javier Rupérez, and his team. We also recognize that Ambassador Rupérez's office is now understaffed, but we hope that the problem will be remedied in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">Brazil supports the current reform of the CTED and expects that it will become fully operational as soon as possible in order to carry out its ambitious work programme under the policy guidance of the plenary of the CTC. I take this opportunity to reiterate the need to allow equitable representation of all regions and legal traditions within its secretariat. It is necessary that the CTED strengthen its capacity in order to better facilitate the provision of technical assistance to all interested States. Brazil strongly encourages States that might benefit from such cooperation to request assistance. The CTC should be a policy-guidance organ -- and effectively it is -- and a competent facilitator of assistance to Member States, which is to be obtained through an increasing dialogue with States and interested international partners within existing international law.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">As mandated by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, Brazil hopes that the visits to States, with their consent, will provide the CTC with a more thorough understanding of the situation in those countries, including further insight into the difficulties States may face in implementing the resolution, as was mentioned by Ambassador Løj this morning. It is essential that a proper follow-up mechanism to those visits be put into place so as to ensure that technical assistance and other needs identified during the visits are duly taken into account.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">My delegation thanks Ambassador César Mayoral for his briefing on the activities of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. We share his perceptions on the recent episodes of terrorism and on their probable impact on the work of the 1267 Committee. We are pleased by the good results of his first visit to selected States, as mandated by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>. The views expressed by the States on the quality of the Committee's list of individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaida and/or the Taliban, as well as on the need to improve listing and delisting procedures, can help the future work of the Committee. Work on improving listing, delisting and exemption procedures must be undertaken, as proposed by Ambassador Mayoral. The enhancement of such procedures will encourage reluctant States to submit names for the lists.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">The ongoing negotiations on a new resolution, pursuant to paragraph 3 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, offer a privileged opportunity to improve the work of the Committee and to focus on some of its most important tasks. The establishment of a definition of the term "associated with Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaida and the Taliban" will certainly help to refine the existing list of individuals and entities. In tailoring that definition, we should be able to balance the need to make it inclusive with the need to respect individual rights and prevent errors. When dealing with the issue of reporting to the Committee by States, we have to guarantee that the format and periodicity adopted will not make the procedure excessively burdensome for Members that lack resources.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">I also thank Ambassador Mihnea Motoc for his briefing on the activities of the 1540 Committee. Based on Member States' positive responses, the 1540 Committee has been able to make steadfast progress in the examination of the relevant national reports. We are pleased to see that the consideration of the whole first round of national reports is likely to be concluded shortly and that the Committee will be in a position to provide a comprehensive report to the Council in 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa11">My delegation joins the Chairman's calls to encourage Member States that have not yet submitted their reports to do so. I trust that the Committee is willing to consider in full all requests for technical assistance in the preparation of the reports or in implementing the provisions of the resolution. Measures to strengthen the Committee's capacity to react to those requests and to facilitate assistance are, I believe, under way.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa12">For Brazil, the very existence of weapons of mass destruction in the hands either of non-State actors or of States themselves is a matter of grave concern. As we continue to call for complete, verifiable and irreversible disarmament of States that possess such arms, we believe that the threat posed by terrorists having access to them is also important and requires appropriate action. These issues seem to be inextricably linked.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa13">Brazil believes that the General Assembly could benefit from the work accomplished by the 1540 Committee if there is need to identify common standards and best practices. My delegation was pleased to join the consensus in the Assembly in April when it adopted the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which addresses the unlawful possession or use of nuclear devices or materials by non-State actors. That clearly showed the resolve of the United Nations to act on those matters and demonstrates that space for debate and compromise is available. My delegation would be ready to support consideration by the General Assembly of common lines of action aimed at preventing terrorists from gaining access to weapons of mass destruction. That would no doubt add unquestionable efficacy to our approach to the threats in the same spirit that the 12 conventions have equipped us to respond to international terrorism in all its aspects.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Løj</span> <span class="nation">Denmark</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">This statement is made in my national capacity. Before proceeding, I wish to fully associate Denmark with the statement made by the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">The Al-Qaida/Taliban sanctions regime is as important as ever in the international fight against terrorism. The 1267 Committee, with the support of its Monitoring Team, endeavours to ensure that the sanctions remain up to date, relevant and adequate to counter the constantly changing threat from Al-Qaida, the Taliban and their associates.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">It is a welcome development that the Committee is receiving an increasing number of names to be added to its consolidated list. At the same time, several countries have voiced concern that the listing and delisting procedures do not live up to the principles of due process. Some countries have even stated that they will not be able to propose names for inclusion on the Committee's list until those concerns have been addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">Whether the lack of due process is real or not, it is crucial that the concerns be addressed. It must be avoided that a number of countries perceive Security Council sanctions to be less than firmly founded on the principles of due process. The issue demands the immediate attention of all members of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">In our efforts to combat international terrorism, it is imperative to strike the right balance between preventive and swift action against terrorists on the one hand, and adequate safeguards for the individual -- and not least for those unjustly targeted -- on the other. It is also very important that our efforts are carried out in full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">At the same time we must, of course, maintain that it is the Security Council that takes any decisions on listing and delisting. In our view, the Council should therefore focus on improving the Committee's delisting procedures. That would enhance the credibility of the sanctions regime, and it would increase the regime's effectiveness by providing additional safeguards so as to avoid keeping on the lists people who do not belong there. Furthermore, improving the delisting procedures will not in any way weaken the effectiveness of preventive actions against terrorists. Listed persons or groups will remain on the list and will therefore be subject to the preventive actions until the Committee decides otherwise.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">A way forward in this respect could be to establish a review mechanism that would consider individual petitions for delisting from individuals and entities affected. The mechanism would be authorized to request unclassified information from the Committee, which would keep the mechanism informed of its activities on a regular basis. After having considered a complaint, the review mechanism would submit a recommendation to the Committee. The Committee would endorse or dismiss the recommendation, thus keeping decision-making within the realm of the Security Council. This mechanism would also act as a filter in cases that are deemed unfounded and consequently do not merit consideration in the Committee. Denmark stands ready to discuss with Council colleagues this or alternative ways forward.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">It is against this background that Denmark is participating actively in the ongoing negotiations of a strengthened 1267 sanctions regime. We thank the United States for a very good draft resolution and for the many innovative and constructive ideas contained in it. Denmark supports almost all of them wholeheartedly. It is, however, of key importance that the resolution also contain very clear language on the Security Council's intention to address the increasing due process concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">Before concluding, I would like to express Denmark's firm support for and confidence in the work of the 1540 Committee, as just described by its Chairman. Thanks to his leadership and the support of its experts, that Committee is on a solid course towards fulfilling its mandate. Much remains to be done, however, and it is of utmost importance that all Member States meet their reporting requirements.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">The work of the 1540 Committee is a key element in our common endeavour to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, including to terrorists and other non-State actors. As we all know, this challenge remains as urgent as ever.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Manongi</span> <span class="nation">Tanzania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">We wish to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for convening this joint briefing. We thank the Chairpersons of the Al-Qaida/Taliban sanctions committee, the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the 1540 Committee for their enlightening presentations on their work.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Permit me to reiterate our condemnation of the recent heinous terrorist attacks in the city of London. As we condemn those cowardly acts, we wish to stress the importance of these joint public briefings in increasing the awareness of, and resolve to address, the enduring threat to our collective security.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">With regard to the mandates of the three committees, our delegation wishes to urge them to cooperate and to coordinate their activities for optimal results of their work. That could include sharing of information prior to and after a visit to a Member State, establishing a common data base, identifying technical-assistance requirements of States, and identifying donors willing to offer such assistance to Member States in need. It is also imperative that the three committees study jointly and carefully the root causes of the perennial problems of non-reporting and of reporting fatigue. What is often presumed to indicate lack of commitment happens to be lack of capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Ambassador Mayoral has worked relentlessly to raise the awareness of Member States concerning the changes in the modus operandi of Al-Qaida networks and to address some of the concerns of Member States. We commend him for that. At present, the Council is considering a new draft resolution to augment the existing sanctions mechanisms. Our delegation is optimistic that it will present the Council with an excellent opportunity to address some of the persistent concerns of Member States, such as the need for due process and transparency in the listing and delisting procedures. It is pleasing to note that four States have appeared before the 1267 Committee for in-depth discussions on the implementation of the sanctions regime. We believe that such interactions are beneficial both to Member States and to the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Allow me to commend Ambassador Løj and the other members of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Committee's Executive Directorate for making remarkable progress in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We call for more expeditious consideration of national reports to make it possible to identify and meet in a timely manner the technical assistance requirements of States.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">We wish to express once again our approval of the best practices related to combating the financing of terrorism that have been developed by the Financial Action Task Force. It is our hope that Member States will utilize the Task Force's special recommendations on terrorist financing to deal effectively with unlawful financial activities.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">Our delegation cannot even contemplate the possibility of terrorists acquiring the wherewithal to carry out a nuclear, biological or chemical attack, owing to the ominous consequences of such an attack. However, we regret to note that terrorists have professed a desire to obtain such dangerous weapons. In view of that, we commend Ambassador Motoc and the entire 1540 Committee for taking the necessary measures to consider national reports and to take account of the needs of States in strengthening their domestic legislation and their law enforcement systems to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to deny non-State actors access to such weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">Finally, I should note that Tanzania has itself fallen victim to a terrorist attack. We will leave no stone unturned in denying terrorists the breeding grounds and means they need to operate effectively, through the strict implementation of all United Nations resolutions against terrorism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rostow</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">Let me begin by joining those who have thanked the Chairmen for their presentations. I also wish to thank them, the staffs of the Committees and the Secretariat for their hard work and their dedication to the struggle against terrorism. Without them, the Security Council would be hard pressed to shoulder with any degree of effectiveness its responsibilities with regard to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">We meet in the shadows of London, Madrid, Bali, Bombay, Mombasa, Taba, Tel Aviv, Beslan, Baghdad, Riyadh and Istanbul -- not an exhaustive list since 11 September 2001, but one long enough to show the persistence of terrorism and the worldwide reach of terrorists. The list does not begin to scrape the surface of the subject. Libraries are full of scholarly works on what terrorism is and on what makes terrorists do what they do. The important point is the one highlighted by the Secretary-General in March of this year: "Groups use terrorist tactics because they think those tactics are effective" (press release <a href="../pdf/SG-SM-9757.pdf" class="nolink">SG/SM/9757</a>). Indeed. What we need to do as an international community is not to give in -- never to give in -- to terrorism, full stop.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">Some time ago, a former official of the United Nations and noted expert on terrorism told the Counter-Terrorism Committee that the United Nations could contribute to the war on terrorism by monitoring State compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and by holding States accountable for compliance. That is what we in this Chamber can do to help those on the front line of protecting our respective citizens and fighting terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">In three and a half years, how has the Counter-Terrorism Committee done? It has engaged in an ongoing dialogue with Member States without precedent in United Nations history. It has put counter-terrorism on the agenda of more than 60 regional, subregional and international organizations and has encouraged them to help their members meet their responsibilities to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It has helped launch a coordinated effort to provide technical assistance to States desiring to meet their counter-terrorist responsibilities but lacking the capacity to do so. Those are not trivial accomplishments. Weakness in worldwide counter-terrorism capacity gives terrorists the opportunity and the space to plot and carry out terrorist activities.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">What about the effort to sanction individuals and entities affiliated with Al-Qaida or the Taliban? The 1267 Committee designations require Member States to freeze the assets and ban the travel of those on the list and to forbid arms sales to them. Under the travel ban, for example, States now must have the 1267 watch list at airports; experts in counter-terrorism believe that that step deters terrorists from conventional air travel. The 1267 Committee's work has led to the freezing or seizing of more than $100 million that might have been available to Al-Qaida or the Taliban.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">The emergence of a more proactive and open dialogue among Member States and the 1267 Committee -- as evidenced by the increased number of briefings provided to Committee members by representatives of Member States -- is a welcome development that should be encouraged. The draft resolution now under consideration by Council experts supports increased dialogue between States and the Committee to strengthen Member States' implementation of the sanctions measures. The draft resolution calls on States to implement the Financial Action Task Force's 40 recommendations and nine special recommendations on terrorist financing as part of the effort to freeze the assets of those on the Committee's consolidated list.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">What of the efforts to make more difficult the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons? The 1540 Committee has overcome its early problems and is deeply engaged in a dialogue with Member States about how they are implementing the resolution and about what more can or should be done. And, of course, the three committees are beginning to work together in a more coordinated fashion.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">While that record is one of accomplishment, we all have to acknowledge that the United Nations can do more to fight terrorism. Let me highlight three areas.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">First, we must accept the fact that, by itself, counter-terrorism activity has an important value. Effective counter-terrorism imposes burdens on the easy movement of people, goods and services, and those burdens are the fault of terrorists, not of counter-terrorism. If one could secure ports, boundaries, et cetera, easily without having an impact on ordinary life, if one could improve security without causing inconvenience, then we would be able to fulfil Sun Zi's aphorism about war: the greatest victory involves no casualties. We must not undermine sound, lawful counter-terrorism measures with specious arguments about their collateral impact.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">Secondly, we really must make counter-terrorism the top priority; it is not enough to pay lip service to it. Everyone in this Chamber knows that making counter-terrorism the top priority is an unpleasant necessity, but they know it is a necessity.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa11">Thirdly, there remains resistance to outlawing terrorism in all circumstances. States and would-be States have to decide: are they going to take seriously the call to put an end to terrorism? Are they going to drain the swamp in which terrorists swim by arresting and prosecuting anyone who commits a terrorist act or supports it? Are they going to do so even if it seems to impugn a cause with which they agree? Or are they going to weaken the counter-terrorism front because of some real or imagined potential to create a policy inconsistency with regard to other national priorities? The upcoming informal consultations on the long-stalled comprehensive convention on international terrorism provides all United Nations Members with an opportunity to turn their collective back on terrorism once and for all.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa12">If we are not unanimous and united in that fighting terrorism is a top priority and that bearing the costs and overcoming practical and political obstacles are our shared burden, then we all shall face a much longer struggle to protect our citizens against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa13">Given its responsibility to maintain international peace and security, the Security Council appropriately should be at the center of the multilateral counter-terrorism effort. To a great extent, the Council's effectiveness depends on its committees being a coherent and unified counter-terrorism instrument. Over the past few years, the Council repeatedly has called on its counter-terrorism related committees and their respective staff bodies to coordinate, cooperate and collaborate. These calls have yet to result in significant action and change in operations. Much more needs to be done. The Council will reiterate this call today with our support. In the end, if the committees and expert groups do not work more closely together than they do at present, the Council may need to act by consolidating the three expert groups into a single unit.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">For the second time, Ambassadors Mayoral, Løj and Motoc have addressed the Security Council at the same meeting, to report to it on their activities and efforts as the heads of their respective Committees. I wish to congratulate them most sincerely for their efforts and their excellent briefings.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">This debate could not be more timely. Although terrorism has been weakened and attacked on all fronts, this vile beast continues to strike with unbearable brutality, as we witness daily the mangled bodies of dozens of Iraqi civilians or the attacks that have thrown the United Kingdom capital into mourning. In fact, faced with the relentless attacks by terrorist groups on civilian populations, we need to tighten our ranks further, strengthen our cooperation in all areas of the anti-terrorism campaign, redouble our vigilance and ensure that our legislation on political asylum will no longer be abused for criminal purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">Moreover, I wish to say that my delegation shares the view expressed by Ambassador Mayoral regarding the three distinct components of Al-Qaida and agrees that it is important for the Al-Qaida/Taliban Committee to focus its efforts on the third category, terrorists who have never left their countries but who are linked to Al-Qaida because they are inspired by the same ideology as it is. We therefore would like the Security Council to broaden the scope of the concept associated with Al-Qaida in the draft resolution now under consideration so that the sanctions regime can be better adapted to keep pace with the terrorist threat.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">We agree with Ambassador Mayoral that briefings for Member States and other institutions by the Committee are extremely useful, and we would like more such briefings to be organized. We congratulate Ambassador Mayoral on his first visit to selected countries, a visit in which my delegation played an active part. We encourage greater use of this effective instrument in order to ensure the implementation of sanctions, to understand the concerns of States in this regard and to strengthen dialogue with them at the political level.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">Moreover, we congratulate Mr. Richard Barrett and the Monitoring Team, as well as the Secretariat members, for the assistance they provide to the Committee. The Monitoring Team's submission of its third report and the quality of that report are a sign of the team's professionalism. We support the Committee's future activities to further strengthen the sanctions regime and thus to create an environment hostile to the threat of Al-Qaida.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">My delegation supports the Counter-Terrorism Committee's (CTC) sixteenth programme of work, which covers the period from 1 July to 30 September 2005. We welcome the dialogue that the CTC and its Chairman and Executive Director have established with Member States, and we encourage them to persevere in these efforts. Strengthening the methodology for identifying States' needs in the area of technical assistance is also to be encouraged.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">We welcome the fact that the CTC, through the Executive Directorate, has carried out three additional visits, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>. We would like to see a road map prepared for future visits, although we do understand the present difficulties of the CTC -- namely, that the Executive Directorate is not fully staffed nor fully operational.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">The question of delays in the submission of reports by Member States is an ongoing concern that must be resolved by dialogue, so that Member States comply with their obligations in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We support the CTC and its Chairman in the future work to be done by this body, and we encourage them to continue to strengthen the dialogue with both Member States and international and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">Considerable efforts carried out by Member States through the submission of national reports, in accordance with paragraph 4 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, reflect the full interest of the international community to face collectively the threat posed by the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by non-State actors. My delegation welcomes the fact that 118 Member States have complied with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, which we adopted just over a year ago. We hope that countries that have not yet submitted their reports will do so as soon as possible in order to allow the Committee to respect the April 2006 deadline set for it so that a comprehensive situation report on the implementation of that resolution can be submitted to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">With this in mind, it would be appropriate for the Committee to establish at this point a suitable framework, enabling it to provide assistance to States so requesting assistance in the implementation of actions set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> in the best possible conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">Finally, my delegation supports the presidential statement to be made at the end of this meeting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Poirier</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">The Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom has spoken on behalf of the European Union Presidency. France fully associates itself with that statement. Nevertheless, I would like to add a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">Like those of previous speakers, our thoughts naturally turn to the victims of the attacks in London on 7 July and in Kusadasi, Turkey, on 16 July, as well as the attacks that are hitting the Middle East, particularly in Baghdad, each week.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">The activities of the three committees, as described today by their Chairs, reflect our chosen approach to counter-terrorism action within the United Nations framework. France is extremely committed to that multilateral approach. We are also aware that progress is necessary to enhance the effectiveness of this collective effort.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">First, cooperation among the three committees on issues of common interest within their respective mandates continues to be the priority. Such cooperation already exists; it needs to continue. Whenever possible, they need to ensure that they exchange information, avoid overlap and seek synergies. The draft presidential statement that you, Sir, will read out at the end of this discussion, is geared to that effort.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">Secondly, I would like to make some comments with respect to each of the three committees.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">We understand that the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED) will finally be operational in September. That will be an important step, because the CTED has an essential role to play in the Committee's work. In that context, we commend Ambassador Løj on her central role in the action of the CTC and the CTED.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">The CTC has many avenues for action, of which I shall cite two. The first concerns good practices in the area of financing and monitoring terrorist financing. We believe that it is essential to endorse as soon as possible the special recommendations and the interpretive notes of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) for the fight against terrorism, as well as the Forty Recommendations on money-laundering. We hope that all members of the Committee be able to endorse those recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa08">The second avenue of action that we wish to mention today has already been brought up by Ambassador Løj in her statement, and that is technical assistance to States that require it in order to complete their reports and effectively fight terrorism. We encourage regional organizations and States with the appropriate resources to contribute to that effort.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa09">With respect to the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions Committee, the sanctions regime has been greatly enhanced since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> in order to adapt it to the evolution of the menace. That work needs to be continued, and negotiations on a new resolution have begun. We hope that the text will be adopted before the end of the month. That would permit the further enhancement and strengthening of existing sanctions -- travel bans, the freezing of assets and arms embargoes -- and of lists of targeted individuals and entities. We thank the Committee's Monitoring Team, which has made a critical contribution to the action and the thinking of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa10">In the negotiations under way on a new resolution, which I have just mentioned, France is closely following three key issues: the effectiveness of existing sanctions; respect for the right of defence and procedural guarantees, which, we believe, are an important part of the sanction regime's effectiveness; and support for good practices in the financial area, in particular those of the FATF.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa11">Finally, with respect to the 1540 Committee, we are very satisfied with the work done and the quick analysis of national reports. However, 74 countries have not yet submitted their reports. France therefore associates itself with other Council members that have expressed their concern at that delay. Finally, I welcome the recruitment of the new experts to help the Committee in its task.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mayoral</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">I now wish to speak briefly in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">As is well known, Argentina is firmly committed to the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, because terrorism is a serious threat to international peace and security and violates the most basic human right -- the right to life -- and constitutes an attack on civilized coexistence.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa03">Incidents such as those that took place in London strengthen our determination. Without listing all cities that have been victims of terrorism, as the representative of the United States has done, we wish to recall that 11 years ago, in 1994, Buenos Aires too was a victim of international terrorism, when the AMIA building was bombed, killing some 100 individuals. Thus, my country is committed to combating terrorism, as is reflected in its decision to chair the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions Committee for the second time.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa04">My country believes that the United Nations, because of its universal character, has the central role to play in the struggle, because terrorism is international. To that end, it is important to coordinate efforts and develop international mechanisms to combat terrorism. We, the Member States, must support the work of our Organization through strict compliance with all Security Council resolutions, not only by applying the sanctions against Al-Qaida and the Taliban but also through all instruments adopted by the Council, such as through the timely submission of all national reports to the Committees so that, among other things, they can evaluate shortcomings and requirements for technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa05">Argentina believes that the international community's fight against terrorism should be carried out in full respect of the Charter of the United Nations, international law, human rights and humanitarian law. The fight against terrorism must also must be conducted in complete transparency and ensure due process and respect for individual rights, thereby not only ensuring its legitimacy and effectiveness but also securing the active cooperation of all Member States. Argentina will continue to strive for the full respect of those principles.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa06">Finally, with respect to the format of today's meeting, we support the joint presentation of the reports of the three Committee Chairmen. We believe that this practice strengthens cooperation and collaboration among the Committees while further clarifying their mandates and their respective areas of competence. We believe and hope that this format should be maintained. We also believe in the importance of the solid coordination of the three groups of experts of the three Committees.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baja</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">We, too, are grateful to the Chairs of the three Committees dealing with implementation of counter-terrorism measures for their comprehensive briefings. They were both timely and relevant. The recent bombings in London and other terrorist acts in other parts of the world are grim reminders of the need to further strengthen and improve our efforts to counter terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">My delegations welcomes the 1267 Committee's consideration of a new resolution that will further improve the sanctions regime. As Ambassador Mayoral said, we are no doubt faced with a threat from Al-Qaida that is radically different from the threat posed when this sanctions regime was first imposed. It is therefore important that the new resolution will not only strengthen a number of the elements in the sanctions regime but also address common concerns expressed by Member States over the implementation of the sanctions measures.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">My delegation notes new developments in the work of the Committee, such as increased briefings from Member States on their experiences in implementation of the sanctions regime, which could provide further inputs and complement the assessments and the visits of the Chair and the monitoring team. A broader engagement with relevant organizations such as Interpol will also be very useful in the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">With respect to the 1540 Committee, my delegation supports Ambassador Motoc's call for Member States that have not yet done so to submit their first national reports. We endorse his view that non-possession of, or non-capacity to develop, biological, chemical or nuclear weapons does not make it unnecessary or irrelevant for States to prepare a national report. The reality is that non-State actors could take advantage of any weak link; thus the submission of such reports to the Committee is imperative, as they aid the Committee in determining how to support a country in implementing the provisions of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">My delegation commends the progress achieved by the Committee, assisted by its experts, in examining the national reports. We welcome in particular the attention being given by the Committee to the issue of capacity-building and technical assistance. We encourage Member States to be proactive, whether in offering assistance or in availing themselves of it, as appropriate, so that they can fully implement the provisions of the resolution and achieve its objective of contributing to international stability.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">On the 1373 Committee, my delegation looks forward to coordination among the three Committees on the matter of addressing issues related to reporting. The innovative approaches developed by such coordination will contribute to strengthening and expanding the process of dialogue with States, alleviate the incipient "reporting fatigue" of Member States, and thereby enhance the effectiveness of the implementation of each Committee's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">We endorse the focus of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, as mentioned by the Chairperson, namely dialogue with States, identification of those States that need technical assistance, and the development of a set of best practices.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">My delegation further welcomes the continuing progress towards making the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED) fully operational.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">Other areas that could be addressed in a coordinated manner by the three Committees are capacity-building and technical assistance. We note that the 1267 Committee has no mandate as concerns technical assistance, which the 1373 and 1540 Committees do. A coordinated approach, where appropriate, could be more focused and resource-effective.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">We are gratified to note that Governments are evolving innovative strategies to deal with the new methods used and the new skills acquired by terrorists. We take note in particular of the statement made by Prime Minister Blair on the need for a political response to terrorism that includes looking at the symptoms and causes of terrorism and countering not only terrorist methods but also terrorist views.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">Indeed, the greatest restraint on human behaviour may not be a police officer or a border guard but adherence to a noble ideal.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa12">One of the most effective operational ways to counter terrorist threats is the establishment of communications procedures for the exchange of information. In South-East Asia, for example, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia signed a trilateral memorandum of understanding three months after 11 September. The memorandum has since been adhered to by Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Viet Nam and is being implemented even at the local level of government. Such an exchange-of-information network provides a greater opportunity to cut off terrorists' access to funds and bomb-making materials.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa13">Finally, let me also take this opportunity to update the Council and other Member States on the progress made by the working group established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a>, which is under the chairmanship of the Philippines. I would like to say at the outset that this update represents the personal views and impressions of the chairmanship and does not in any way restrict or reflect the position of other members of the working group.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa14">Under the mandate of the Security Council, the working group commenced its activities in January this year. To fulfil its Council mandate, the working group agreed to conduct its work in two phases. The first phase was that of information-gathering, during which the group sought the widest range of views and suggestions from established experts on the areas under the group's mandate. The second phase will involve the consideration by the working group of its recommendations to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa15">The working group conducted its information-gathering phase during the first six months of the year. We have had excellent briefings from top-notch experts and practitioners from both within and outside the United Nations. The working group has benefited greatly from the views and suggestions of those who have graciously briefed it and also from those who have briefed the other committees, particularly the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa16">For the rest of the year, the working group will focus on preparing its recommendations to the Council. The working group has agreed to consider three broad issues: namely, practical measures, as mentioned in paragraph 9 of the resolution; the possible scope of those practical measures; and the question of victims, under paragraph 10 of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa17">The working group has agreed to conduct its work in complete transparency vis-à-vis the wider membership of the United Nations. In that vein, the chairmanship will hold, from time to time, consultations with the wider United Nations membership to hear States' views and suggestions on the issues under consideration by the working group. The chairmanship had initially organized such a meeting on 27 April, and, with the agreement of the members of the working group, will convene a similar meeting with United Nations Members in the next few weeks.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Konuzin</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">Let me at the outset, Mr. President, thank you for having convened today's meeting, during which we are continuing the positive practice of holding joint briefings by the chairpersons of the three counter-terrorist Committees of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">I should like also to express my gratitude to Ambassador César Mayoral, Ambassador Ellen Løj and Ambassador Mihnea Motoc for their substantive briefings and in general for their tireless efforts at the head of their respective committees.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa03">We note with sadness that, despite the international efforts made, the victims of terrorism in recent days have included dozens of people in London, in Turkey and in the Middle East, including in Iraq. My own compatriots in Russia have died at the hands of terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa04">With respect to the subject of today's meeting, the Russian delegation views the work of the 1267 Committee as one of the key areas of the counter-terrorism activities of the Council. We fully support the efforts of the Committee and of its Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team to enhance the sanctions regime against the Taliban and Al-Qaida, and we support negotiations on a new resolution of the Security Council that is meant to ensure that that task is effectively addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa05">In the context of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), I should like to highlight the ongoing efforts of the Danish Chairperson and of all members of the Committee to develop new forms of dialogue with States by carrying out country visits, enhancing reporting mechanisms, incorporating new methods for assessing States' technical assistance needs, and disseminating best practices in order to fully and effectively implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa06">The CTC is successfully developing its cooperation with international and regional organizations. Indeed, expert assistance is particularly important when carrying out country visits.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa07">At the same time, there is growing concern at the fact that the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED) is not yet fully staffed, which clearly is having a negative impact on the CTC's ability successfully to address the tasks facing it, including its plans to intensify its counter-terrorism work. We believe that this problem will be dealt with in the near term and that, at subsequent meetings of the Council on the work of the three Committees, there will no longer be a need to take up this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa08">Worth noting are the positive dynamics in the work of the 1540 Committee, benefiting from the active support of the expert team.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa09">We share the view that, at this stage, the priority task is to clear the backlog of States that have not submitted their national reports. We hope that the appeal made by the Group of Eight at Gleneagles for countries that have not yet done so to immediately submit their reports on the measures they have undertaken at the national level in the area of non-proliferation and on their contributions to international cooperation will be heeded.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa10">Increasing the Committee's practical interaction with international and regional organizations in the area of non-proliferation and export controls continues to be a pressing matter. We support efforts aimed at expanding the geographical scope and the formats of such cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa11">Given the long-term nature of the tasks set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, we believe that it would be appropriate to extend the Committee's mandate beyond April 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, I would like to touch upon one of today's most pressing issues on the counter-terrorism agenda of the United Nations. Informal consultations will be held next week on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Russia supports those efforts, which are aimed at quickly reaching consensus on this most important of legal instruments in the area of counter-terrorism. We hope that other delegations share our view, and that they will be prepared for constructive dialogue to successfully complete that work and promptly adopt the text of the convention.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Greece.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">At the outset, I would like to thank the three Committee Chairmen for their most informative briefings.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa03">Greece fully associates itself with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union. I would, however, like to add the following points.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa04">This debate is taking place only a short time after the deadly terrorist attacks in London, which we condemn and which deeply shocked the international community. Once more, it was proved that terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to the most fundamental value of mankind, that is, the right to life, freedom and security of person. The London terrorist attacks, as well as last year's attacks in Madrid and those elsewhere, whether in the past or more recently, show that terrorism is likely to be with us for a considerable period of time. No country is immune. We should therefore accelerate and better coordinate our efforts to eradicate it, both domestically and internationally.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa05">Acts of terrorism are not justifiable on any grounds, be they political, philosophical, religious or other. Those committing such acts should be brought to justice. However, our fight against terrorism must not ignore human rights. Counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not mutually exclusive.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa06">The United Nations has played, and continues to play, an important role in the fight against terrorism by addressing the challenge as one of the most serious threats to our peace and security, as well as by addressing the challenge of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The work and ongoing efforts of the three committees have considerably enhanced the role of the United Nations in dealing with those threats. I would like to express our appreciation to the Chairmen of the committees for their commitment and dedication in carrying out their difficult tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa07">With respect to the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions Committee, I would like to express my sincere thanks to its Chairman, Ambassador César Mayoral. The visits he carried out to Member States were useful and facilitated a better understanding of their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> and subsequent resolutions. We also thank the Committee's Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team for its work to improve the effectiveness of the sanctions regime. We look forward to its third report and anticipate new recommendations on necessary improvements in that field. The visits of the Team to Member States and to regional organizations have enhanced the Committee's interaction with those States and organizations. The result will be better implementation of sanctions.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa08">Likewise, we look forward to the renewal of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, with a view to improving the sanctions regime. The principle of due process must be taken into consideration. In our view, sanctions can serve their objective only if their implementation is consistent with the protection of human rights. We also think that more transparent and clearer criteria and requirements should be established for the listing and de-listing of individuals and entities. Individuals and entities included in the Committee's list should be informed about the measures imposed on them, listing and de-listing procedures and the humanitarian exemptions provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1452(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1452 (2002)</a>. Lastly, we think that a process for reviewing the cases of individuals and entities claiming to have been wrongfully placed or retained on the Committee's list should be envisaged as a means of improving the sanctions regime and enhancing its legitimacy.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa09">On the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), I would like to extend my warm congratulations to Ambassador Ellen Margrethe Løj for her intensive efforts to strengthen the Committee's dialogue with Member States. I would also very much like to thank the Committee's Executive Directorate for its work, as well as Ambassador Rupérez and his staff. The recent visits to Kenya, Albania and Thailand by members of the Executive Directorate constitute useful tools to assist States to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in an open manner and to identify the technical assistance needs of States. However, what is really important is to have proper follow-up for those visits. We were pleased to hear from the Committee's Chair that that issue is a high priority for the CTC. Furthermore, we fully support the efforts of the Committee to continue its dialogue with Member States that have not submitted their reports, in order to encourage them to report in a timely manner. Finally, we believe that the Committee should develop a set of best practices to provide guidance for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> on the basis of best practices developed in the context of other international, regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa10">I also wish to express our appreciation to the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, Ambassador Motoc, for his efforts to advance the work of the Committee. We were pleased to hear that, with the support of the group of experts, the Committee has already examined more than 50 reports. It is a matter of concern, though, that 75 States are late in submitting their national reports. Such delays do not facilitate the fulfilment of the Committee's mandate. They also do not allow the Security Council to assess the progress achieved by the States concerned in their implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>. We urge those States to meet their obligation under the resolution and to submit their reports without further delay.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa11">We welcome the adoption by the General Assembly earlier this year of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which addresses another serious aspect of the terrorist threat. We urge all Member States to sign the Convention at the summit to be held in September. Likewise, we support the early conclusion of the negotiations on a comprehensive convention on terrorism, as well as its adoption during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa12">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa13">There are still a number of speakers remaining on my list for this meeting. I intend, with the concurrence of the members of the Council, to suspend the meeting until 3 p.m.</p>
