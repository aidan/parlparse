	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attack that occurred outside the Danish embassy in Islamabad on 2 June 2008, causing numerous deaths, injuries and damage to nearby buildings, including a building housing the United Nations Development Programme. It expresses its deep sympathy and condolences to the victims of this heinous act of terrorism and to their families, and to the people and Governments of Pakistan and Denmark.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council underlines the need to bring the perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism to justice and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and consistent with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1624 (2005)</a>, to cooperate actively with the Pakistani authorities in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council further reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. The Council reminds States that they must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-19.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/19</a>.</p>
