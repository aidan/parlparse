	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa02">President Dowiyogo was a dedicated statesman of Nauru for more than three decades. He came to the office of the presidency nine times and steadfastly advocated the causes of Nauru. Throughout his political life, President Dowiyogo also displayed an exceptional intellect and vision on a range of issues in international affairs. With a deep and abiding belief in multilateralism and cognizant of the challenges faced by small island developing States, such as Nauru, President Dowiyogo worked to strengthen international cooperation to achieve the goal of sustainable development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa03">The world community will always remember President Dowiyogo's noble contributions to the betterment of all humanity.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa01">On behalf of the Eastern European Group of States Members of the United Nations, I would like to extend to the people and the Government of the Republic of Nauru our deepest and most sincere condolences for the demise of President Bernard Dowiyogo.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa02">Since the beginning of his political career in 1973, when he was elected as a member of Parliament, until his ninth and final term as President of the Republic Nauru, the late Bernard Dowiyogo served in an exemplary manner the interests of his people and his country. The fact that, before his election to the highest political post in the Republic of Nauru, he was a long-term member of cabinet as Minister of Health, Minister of Justice and Minister for Island Development and Industry is evidence of his outstandingly high competence and expertise.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa03">The late President Dowiyogo was a person of principle and stature and a politician of unswerving belief who worked relentlessly for democracy and his country. As Head of State and Government of the Republic of Nauru, Bernard Dowiyogo led the Nauru delegations to such landmark United Nations summits as the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and the United Nations Millenium Assembly. He joined world leaders in adopting the historic Agenda 21 and the Millennium Declaration Goals.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa04">We are convinced that the political legacy of Bernard Dowiyogo, who dedicated his life to the prosperity and well-being of his people, will be cherished and built upon by future generations in Nauru.</div>

The States members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States would like to take this opportunity to express their profound sympathy to the people of Nauru on the loss of its great leader and patriot and to the family of the late President.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa02">Even a brief review of the late President's life will attest to the fact that he was totally committed to public life and to the service of his country. He was active in public life for 32 long years and served as President of Nauru as many as nine times. His great contribution to the achievement of the independence and development of his country should not go unnoticed, while, throughout his many years of service, he played a key diplomatic role in the international affairs of his country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa03">The Latin American and Caribbean Group sincerely joins the international community in paying tribute to this great son and patriot of the Republic of Nauru.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa01">I have the sad privilege today, on behalf of the African Group, of conveying to the friendly delegation, Government and people of Nauru our condolences on the loss of the President of the Republic of Nauru. It is clearly a heavy burden in such circumstances to express to our friends in Nauru the extent to which the African Group in its entirety shares their sorrow.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa02">The Republic of Nauru lost its President, the late Bernard Dowiyogo, during the course of extremely complicated heart surgery. President Dowiyogo died at the young age of 57 and had just begun his ninth and final term as President of Nauru. Obviously, having been re-elected nine times to that office, the late Bernard Dowiyogo can truly be considered a major personality in his country and beyond.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa03">We need only recall Bernard Dowiyogo's career to note the great role he played in the political life of his country and on the international scene. Having studied law in Australia and in his own country, Bernard Dowiyogo launched his political career by being elected to Parliament in 1971 for the district which he represented continuously for 32 years, right up to his death. He was a member of several Governments in Nauru and occupied a variety of important ministerial posts. He was elected President for the first time in 1976, at the age of 30, thereby becoming Nauru's youngest President ever. Bernard Dowiyogo was a man of principle and conviction, committed to human rights and to protecting the environment. He was a man of law and order who won the respect of all in Nauru and abroad.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa04">For those who have lost him -- his wife, his eight children and his 29 grandchildren -- I would recall Massillon's beautiful funeral oration for Louis XIV. With respect to one who called himself Louis the Great, the orator said what the muezzin, in his incomparable voice, reminds us Muslims five times a day: God alone is great, my brothers. God alone is great; every one else is mortal.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa01">The United States, as host country, salutes the great life of President Dowiyogo. His passing, last month, was a loss not only to the people of Nauru but also the wider Pacific community, including the United States. For three decades, President Dowiyogo was a towering figure in Nauru's public life. He was well known in Washington and was admired for his calm determination to speak his mind in the service of his countrymen.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa02">When he took office in January -- one of his many terms as President -- there were only three months left before the next elections. One might have thought that an ordinary politician would have stayed at home building alliances in advance of his next run for office. But President Dowiyogo was no ordinary politician; he was a statesman. He knew the importance of travelling abroad to represent his country at the highest level in order to advance the interests of his people. He led Nauru's delegations to the Earth Summit and to the Millennium Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa03">In March, despite delicate health, he once again led a delegation of top officials, this time to Washington, for a series of important talks. In those talks President Dowiyogo made a bold decision to counter money laundering and the purchase of passports, limiting the vulnerability of his nation to international crimes. Those were moves for which the United States and the entire international community owe a debt of thanks. They mark a final display of the President's trademark courage and statesmanship.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk03-pa04">The United States and the American people feel a special loss at the passing of President Dowiyogo, both because he ended his life on our soil and because of his long-standing friendship with my country. Our thoughts and prayers go to his family, to our colleague Ambassador Clodumar here in New York and to all the people of Nauru.</div>

	Mr. Clodumar (Nauru)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa01">It is an honour and a privilege for me to deliver this statement in tribute to the life and leadership of the late President Bernard Dowiyogo of the People of Nauru, for and on behalf of the Government and the people of Nauru.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa02">At the outset, let me thank you, Mr. President, for arranging this special event this morning as part of a United Nations mark of respect for our fallen leader, and for the kind words you have spoken. I also wish to thank each of the Chairpersons of the five regional groups and the representative of the host country for their kind words. I would also like to take this opportunity to express the deepest appreciation of my Government and of the family of the late President Bernard Dowiyogo to all the Member States that sent letters of condolence or signed the condolence book at the Mission -- or both -- as well as to the many institutions and personal friends of Nauru who did likewise. Those messages have been conveyed to the Government and to the family of the late President Bernard Dowiyogo, as appropriate. I personally delivered the condolence book to the family of the President while I was in Nauru for the funeral.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa03">Bernard Dowiyogo served his country and the people of Nauru for over 30 years, until his death on 9 March 2003 in Washington, D.C., following major heart surgery five days earlier. He was 57 years old. In the 30 years of his public life he was elected President of Nauru nine times, beginning in 1976 at the age of 30. His longest term as President was from December 1989 to December 1995, having been elected President following general elections in December 1989 and November 1992. I had the privilege of being a minister in his Government during that period, and therefore have a close and personal understanding of the aspirations he had for his country and for the people of Nauru.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa04">It is not easy to take the measure of Bernard Dowiyogo's contribution to the global community -- first because of the fact that Nauru is not well known to the international audience and, secondly, because Nauru's politics have had negligible influence in the international arena. However, if one analyses either periods during which Bernard Dowiyogo held the presidency of Nauru or those during which he held a ministerial portfolio, one realizes that they coincided with some important United Nations events that required the political will of leaders to push through what were then tough political decisions. On most of those occasions Nauru was there to be counted on. I will cite just a few instances for the record: the London Convention against the dumping of nuclear waste into the oceans; the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the Barbados Plan of Action; the Millennium Declaration Goals; and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Therefore, in our eyes, he ranks among the greatest statesmen of the twentieth century, because of his wisdom and his courage in standing up for the things that he believed would make the planet a safer and more equitable place for future generations of mankind.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa05">In the Oceania region Bernard Dowiyogo is better known for his tenacious stance against French nuclear testing in French Polynesia, which at one point resulted in the breaking off of diplomatic ties between Nauru and France; against the Marshall Islands proposal to accept the storage of nuclear waste in islets within its territories; and against the shipment of nuclear waste on ships traversing the Pacific Ocean from Europe to Japan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa06">On the issue of human rights and the right of peoples to self-determination Bernard Dowiyogo was forthright in his stance against the abuse of citizens committed by those in authority. One will recall the statement he made during the Millennium Assembly with regard to the people of Papua to self-determination and with regard to the violation of the human rights of the Papuan people at the hands of the Indonesian junta.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa07">On the home front, we in Nauru are also aware of his many contributions to the nation. During his longest term as President, he undertook the biggest infrastructure development programme of any Nauruan Government to date, which proved to be a timely decision, for soon thereafter the economy took a downturn.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa08">His mettle was tested during the proceedings against Australia in the International Court of Justice for damages arising from breach of trust while Nauru was under a League of Nations mandate and, after the Second World War, under the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. The new Dowiyogo Government was placed under intense pressure by Australia to withdraw the case, but he refused to do so. Nauru was successful at the first stage of the proceedings, but accepted Australia's request to settle the matter out of court.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa09">When the economy of Nauru continued to spiral downward in the mid-1990s, Bernard Dowiyogo had the courage and political will to seek the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help his Government restructure the imbalances in the Nauruan economy that were affecting the standard of living and the ability of the Government to meet its internal and external obligations. He knew that the menu that the ADB would prescribe would be politically unpopular, but this did not discourage him from implementing the programme.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa10">As it turned out, he lost the presidency following the general election in 1995, and in ensuing years he regained and lost the presidency three times. Bernard Dowiyogo regained the presidency for the ninth and last time in January 2003. Despite his declining health, he fought hard to take charge of the Government, because he realized that the future of Nauru would depend on a leader who was willing to make hard decisions that might not be popular with his parliamentary colleagues or the electors. That was his aspiration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa11">Bernard Dowiyogo was a consummate politician and a person of great principle. He never wavered in his belief in democracy and the rule of law. When his doctor spoke to him about surgery, he told him that he came to the United Nations to take part in very important discussions with the United States Government, and he made it very clear that he had no intention of allowing any medical intervention until he had completed what he came to do.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa12">He was true to what he told his wife, Christina, when he became President in 1976: that his priorities were first and foremost the Government and the nation, then his colleagues and friends, and then his family, in that order. This is the measure of the man. The late President Bernard Dowiyogo was the first President to die in office. May his soul rest in peace.</div>

The Group of 77 is convinced that the implementation of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, will help set out the terms of a world in which globalization is not only driven by the interests of the strong but is also managed for the benefit of the weak.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa06">That constitutes the framework in which the Group of 77 and China hope to work with Mark Malloch Brown, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, over the next four years. Our objective in this period should be the implementation of what we have agreed on in the major United Nations conferences and summits to help the poor in the struggle against poverty. That is a challenge that we have to face hand in hand with Mr. Mark Malloch Brown. I thank him very much, and I wish the best for him and his family.</div>

For its part, the Asian Group will continue to extend its full cooperation and support to him in the discharge of his responsibilities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa02">Mr. Malloch Brown's reappointment is a fitting tribute to his commitment to promoting development globally and reflects the confidence of Member States in his ability to guide the UNDP at this crucial juncture in overall United Nations reform. In that respect, Mr. Malloch Brown has provided invaluable leadership in making the UNDP a service- and results-oriented organization, especially by effectively providing advice and expertise where it is needed most. In particular, we commend his initiative of utilizing information technology to the fullest extent in the service of development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa03">Given that the Millennium Development Goals are central to the global development agenda, the focus of the work of the UNDP is now to translate the vision into action. We remain convinced that Mr. Malloch Brown's extended tenure will facilitate the United Nations strategy to meet the Millennium Development Goals and to assist countries all over the world in achieving their development targets.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa04">The States members of the Asian Group have enjoyed a close and cooperative working relationship with the UNDP. In fact, that dynamic relationship has been strengthened over the years despite the evolving changes and budgetary constraints. The Asian Group acknowledges the UNDP's constructive endeavours in the region, in particular in such areas as poverty reduction, good governance, HIV/AIDS and gender equality. We particularly commend the UNDP's role under the leadership of Mr. Malloch Brown in formulating and implementing programmes for the recovery and reconstruction of Afghanistan. We look forward to seeing an ever-increasing role and contribution of the UNDP under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Malloch Brown in the years to come.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa02">We recall the challenges Mr. Malloch Brown took up when he joined in 1999. Under his leadership, the UNDP has effected a transformation that has been remarkable in its speed and breadth. That transformation has seen the introduction of a focus on governance and its programmes, as well as a strong emphasis on results and -- particularly difficult -- on demonstrating results. The transformation has encompassed dimensions of strategic reorientation, downsizing and staff renewal, all the while maintaining a determined focus on poverty reduction and sustainable human development.</div>

That confirmation reflects his capable leadership in fulfilling United Nations operational activities for development, which are critically needed to achieve our goals for sustainable development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa02">We live in a world that requires a sustained and nuanced commitment to socio-economic development -- an integrated approach that both reflects an understanding of material needs, culture and history, and takes account of the complicated issues that face developing countries today. Mr. Malloch Brown has amply shown such a commitment. We are fully confident that he will guide the UNDP well during the years to come. The challenge for the United Nations over the next decade and, very likely, the next century, is to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Under the leadership of Mr. Malloch Brown, UNDP efforts in formulating and articulating those goals, which place development in its global context, are already being appreciated.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa03">Mr. Malloch Brown serves UNDP in particular, and the United Nations more broadly, by placing those goals at the forefront of his agenda. UNDP's efforts to bring together policy experts, scholars and fundraisers to work towards common goals and to advocate publicly for their being seen as global concerns have placed development efforts in a new light in the eyes of the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa04">We can struggle together with how to keep our efforts streamlined without losing the human touch; how to reduce poverty and eliminate HIV/AIDS without being swamped in onerous deliberation; and how to manage a global network of country offices and policy projects without forgetting the realities of life of people in need. UNDP's leadership role in the Millennium Campaign and the Millennium Project have shown the world its innovation and commitment. We are confident that we have seen just the beginning. We look forward to many years of mutual learning, productive partnership and, we trust, better and more humane living conditions for people in all parts of the world.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I should like to join all previous speakers in congratulating Mark Malloch Brown on his appointment as Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for a further four-year term. I an personally very pleased that we have just approved his reappointment, because I believe that he has done an outstanding job during his first term. Under his leadership, UNDP has completed a process of reform and revitalization in a timely and very effective manner and, as a result, has established itself in a pivotal role within the United Nations development system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa02">When he took up office in 1999, UNDP was in a difficult situation. Core resources had fallen to an all-time low of $630 million, and there were expectations that that drop would continue. In four short years the funding situation has been turned around and confidence in the organization has increased dramatically. The core budget is growing, and so is UNDP's contribution to world development. Confidence in the organization has grown largely because of Mark Malloch Brown's bold reforms. From a dispersed organization that funded a variety of areas of technical assistance, UNDP has been turned into a networked, practice-based and results-oriented organization. The speed with which UNDP has responded to post-conflict situations, such as Afghanistan and East Timor, and to new developmental challenges in Africa and elsewhere, reflect the new agility and relevance of the organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Mark Malloch Brown has worked hard to bring the United Nations development perspective, and that of the Bretton Woods institutions, much closer. He relentlessly built partnerships between UNDP and the Bretton Woods institutions that have increased understanding of the United Nations in Washington and of the Bretton Woods perspective here in New York. The growing support in the United Nations for Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and the rallying of the Bretton Woods institutions around the Millennium Development Goals are, to a certain extent, his achievements. He has also steadily fostered greater coherence of United Nations development operations through his chairmanship of the United Nations Development Group and through the resident coordinator system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa04">Today, if UNDP is a strong voice for the United Nations in development and if it has become an efficient, results-driven and increasingly better-funded organization, it is to Mark Malloch Brown's credit. His talented, highly motivated staff shares with him the credit for that turnaround.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Personally, I have had the opportunity to meet Mark Malloch Brown several times, on a variety of occasions. First, I met him shortly after he had assumed the post of Administrator of UNDP. At that time, in an attempt to reverse the negative trend in financing, he had initiated a ministerial meeting that I had the honour to chair as President of the UNDP Executive Board in 2000. I also met with him in Monterrey at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, where he was actively participating and vigorously pushing forward the development agenda and partnerships. On those and other occasions, I have always witnessed a determined, eloquent and dedicated advocate of development and a firm supporter of development cooperation. I feel privileged to have met him.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa06">I wish Mark Malloch Brown a successful term in the UNDP. On behalf of the entire General Assembly, I should like once again to congratulate him on his appointment.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa03">Members will also recall that, in paragraph 7, the General Assembly also decided to hold, prior to the High-Level Dialogue, one day of informal hearings with representatives of civil society and the business sector accredited to the Dialogue.</div>
