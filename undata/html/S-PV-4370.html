	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">At the very outset, on behalf of the entire Security Council, I wish to convey to the representative of the United States, Ambassador Jim Cunningham, and to the entire United States delegation our feelings of distress and deep solidarity and our condolences on behalf of all members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">I now invite members of the Council and all those present in the Chamber to observe a minute of silence in memory of all the victims of the terrorist acts that struck New York and the United States yesterday.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Members of the Council have before them a draft resolution, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-861.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/861</a>, which has been prepared in the course of prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Members of the Council who wish to speak are invited to so inform the Secretariat. I would point out to the many delegations present that are not members of the Council that, in the course of consultations, in view of the fact that the General Assembly will hold a meeting on the same subject this afternoon at 3 p.m., it was deemed preferable to limit the list of speakers to the 15 members of the Council. However, those delegations wishing to have their planned statements included in the official records of the Council are urged to transmit those statements to the Secretariat so that they might be fully reflected in the official record.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">I thank the Secretary-General for his presence here today and invite him to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk09">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">We meet, as you have said, Sir, in exceptionally grave circumstances. Our host country and this host city have been subjected to a terrorist attack which horrifies us all. We do not yet know the full extent of the damage, but it seems certain that thousands of people have lost their lives and that many have suffered dreadful injuries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">All of us feel deep shock and revulsion at the cold-blooded viciousness of this attack. All of us condemn it and those who planned it -- whoever they may be -- in the strongest possible terms. All of us, I am sure, extend our most profound sympathy to the victims, to their loved ones and to the people and Government of the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">More than that, we must express our solidarity with the American Government and people in this hour of trial.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">Terrorism is an international scourge which the United Nations has many times condemned. A terrorist attack on one country is an attack on humanity as a whole. All nations of the world must work together to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">Yesterday's events took us to a place beyond our imagining. The United Kingdom is united in deep shock and sympathy for the people of the United States and in the determination to eradicate terrorism globally, in cooperation with and in support of the United States. Her Majesty the Queen expressed to President Bush yesterday, on behalf of the British people, her heartfelt sympathy for the very many bereaved and injured and her admiration for those -- let us remember this -- who are now trying to cope with the unfolding tragedy of what has happened.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">The international spirit of response, I think, was also exemplified by the European Union in a meeting of ministers this morning, who said that these horrendous acts are an attack not only on the United States, but against humanity itself and the values and freedoms we all share. But the life and work of our open and democratic societies will continue undeterred. My Prime Minister has expressed similar sentiments and calls us to understand that mass terrorism is the new evil in our world today, perpetrated by fanatics who are utterly indifferent to the sanctity of human life.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">We support the substance of the draft resolution that the Council is to consider. We all have to understand that this is a global issue, an attack on the whole of modern civilization and an affront to the human spirit. We must all respond globally and show the strength of that spirit.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Koonjul</span> <span class="nation">Mauritius</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">My delegation is profoundly shocked by yesterday's traumatic events, the impact and magnitude of which are yet to be felt and fully assessed. On behalf of the Government of Mauritius and its people, I wish to convey our deepest sympathies and condolences to the Government and people of the United States of America and, more particularly, to the families of the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">We unreservedly condemn in the strongest terms the inhuman and barbaric terrorist acts that have taken the lives of thousands of innocent victims, including women and children, and which have caused considerable material damage. We are confident that the people of America will rise up to the challenges and overcome the sufferings and atrocities they have just experienced.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">The people of America have once again shown their exemplary resilience in such tragic circumstances. These attacks, while targeting the United States, are aimed at democracy and the free world. All of us who believe in the cardinal values of democracy stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the American people in the struggle to preserve peace and the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">The perpetration of such cowardly acts clearly demonstrates that no country, no matter how prepared it may be, is immune to terrorist attacks. Yesterday's acts once again confirm that terrorism knows no bounds or boundaries. Indeed, terrorism represents a major threat to international peace and security. We believe that this issue should be addressed in a comprehensive manner, in the framework of international cooperation. In that regard, we would support the idea of holding a special Security Council summit to discuss ways and means of combating terrorism in all its forms and proportions.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">Like other delegations, Mauritius stands ready to cooperate with the United States and the international community to find the perpetrators of yesterday's acts and bring them to justice.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Keita</span> <span class="nation">Mali</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the Government and people of Mali, I would first of all like to convey to the people and Government of the United States of America our deepest condolences and sympathies on the tragic events that took place in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on Tuesday, 11 September 2001. I also join with the President of the Security Council in extending the condolences of the delegation of Mali to the delegation of the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Mali firmly condemns those barbarous attacks, which no cause could justify. We hope for the speedy recovery of the many persons injured, and we pray for the repose of the souls of those who have lost their lives in these attacks. Mali stands in solidarity with the American people and with any decision to be taken by the Security Council in this regard.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">We are very grateful to you, Mr. President, for convening this urgent meeting of the Security Council. What happened yesterday is a terrible catastrophe. It is a tragic loss for the American people. We admire the bravery and tenacity of firefighters, policemen and the whole American nation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">I wish to use this opportunity to quote a statement made by our Minister for Foreign Affairs that conveys the essence of Ukraine's reaction to yesterday's events in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine expresses its deepest indignation at the unprecedented outbreak of terrorist acts committed on 11 September in the United States. This crime, directed primarily against civilians, is a direct challenge not only to the United States, but to the entire civilized world. Whoever is behind this tragedy have put themselves beyond the laws of human civilization and deserve a just and inevitable punishment. In this dramatic hour, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine expresses its sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this malicious and barbaric act.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa04">"The shocking events in the United States once again speak for the need to join the efforts of the whole international community in the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations."</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa05">The magnitude of yesterday's acts goes beyond terrorism as we have known it so far. With the new technologies and the changed nature of the world in which they operate, a handful of angry Samsons and disciples of apocalypse would suffice to cause havoc. We therefore think that new definitions, terms and strategies have to be developed for the new realities.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa06">I want to propose declaring the tragic day of 11 September as an international day to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa07">Finally, I believe it would be worthwhile to consider convening a ministerial meeting of the Council -- possibly in the nearest future; maybe in the week of 24 September -- to discuss our response to international terrorism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahbubani</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">You have asked us to be brief, Mr. President. We will be brief, but we hope that the brevity of our statement is not in any way taken as an indication of the depth of the shock, horror and outrage that we feel about yesterday's developments.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">By any standards, what happened yesterday was a great tragedy. We join our colleagues in conveying our deepest condolences to the victims and their families and to the people and Government of the United States of America. Both the President and the Prime Minister of Singapore have conveyed the condolences of Singapore to President George W. Bush.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">We also join others in strongly condemning these acts of terrorism. We have consistently taken the position that terrorism anywhere should not be condoned for any reason whatever.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">What happened yesterday also demonstrates clearly that the international community has to come together to react to such terrorism. Several proposals have been tabled this morning for a stronger international response. We support all these responses, and we hope that the Security Council will come together and deliver a very effective response to ensure that the events of yesterday are not repeated.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">We also join our colleagues in supporting the draft resolution before us.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mejdoub</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Allow me first of all, on this tragic day, to express my country's deep sympathies to the United States, an old friend of Tunisia's for over 200 years. President Ben Ali has conveyed his condolences to President Bush and has stated Tunisia's categorical condemnation of these acts.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">We extend our compassion and solidarity to Ambassador Jim Cunningham, the delegation of the United States and the grieving American nation. We extend our deepest condolences to the countless families that are being so sorely tested at this time. We share their deep emotion and grief.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Yesterday's tragedy is an unacceptable crime, one which has afflicted innocent people. No civilization condones, and no cause whatever can justify, the odious crime perpetrated in three cities of this country on Tuesday, 11 September, just as the United Nations was preparing to ring the Peace Bell for the new millennium commencing this year. Taking place on the very day of the opening of the General Assembly, this brutal and malicious attack is both an outrage and a challenge to the entire international community.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">We therefore condemn in the most forceful way the authors of this tragedy, both the perpetrators themselves and those who ordered it. It is time for all societies of the international community to root out this madness and to cooperate on both preventing and combating terrorism and organized crime.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">In the light of dreadful events such as this, if we want to succeed, we must act together. We will be stronger if we are all united -- a family united in a spirit of solidarity.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ryan</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01">We witnessed yesterday in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania an attack of barbarism and evil against innocent people. As the Secretary-General has just said, this was an attack on all humanity and the values of humanity. Every nation and every human being can only be affronted in the face of such evil.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa02">On behalf of the Irish Government and people, I extend to the Government and people of the United States our deep and heartfelt sympathy. Ireland's Prime Minister, Mr. Bertie Ahern, said yesterday that our thoughts, above all else, are now with the families of all the victims in their mourning and loss. The Council of Ministers of the European Union, in a special session today, has expressed its horror at yesterday's terrorist attacks and its solidarity with the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa03">Europeans have been asked to mark this horrific event on Friday next; we in Ireland will also do so. Practically every village in Ireland is bonded as family with the American people. Our heart and prayers go to those now heroically working -- the police, the fire crews, the emergency services, doctors and nurses -- to help the injured and save life.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa04">The American people should know that they are not alone in their grief and revulsion at what has happened. They are joined by decent men and women in every part of the world, from every cultural background, by people of every religion and of none. Respect for the human rights of each and every person, for the right of every nation and every human being to live in freedom and dignity: these are fundamental principles for the United Nations. It is these values that the perpetrators of yesterday's crimes seek to destroy.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa05">In our sorrow and loss, it is also right today to clearly assert that from evil can only come evil; that no cause that is based on mass murder and carnage can ever succeed; that those who perpetrate such deeds are the enemies of all peoples everywhere. Those responsible for yesterday's barbarism are the enemies of peace and justice. They must be brought to justice and the entire international community must work together towards this end. Here in the United Nations, it is right to say today, in mourning and in sadness, but with absolute conviction and determination, that they will not be allowed to succeed in seeking to destroy the goals and vision that the United Nations shares with all the peoples of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa06">Ireland supports fully the draft resolution before the Security Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Yingfan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">We are deeply shocked by and strongly condemn yesterday's serious terrorist attacks against New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. China's President Jiang Zemin and Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan have addressed messages to President Bush and Secretary of State Powell, expressing profound sympathy to the Government and the people of the United States of America and deep condolences to the families of the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Yesterday, Secretary-General Annan and the President of the Security Council, Ambassador Levitte, issued statements that we fully support. International terrorism causes tremendous losses to the lives and property of innocent civilians and seriously endangers human society and the political and economic order of countries. It is a serious potential danger to international peace and security. The Chinese Government always condemns and opposes all terrorist violence. Yesterday's terrorist attacks, which stunned the world, took place in the United States, but they also represent an open challenge to the international community as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">We support the United Nations in strengthening its work in preventing and combating terrorism. We are in favour of the ongoing enhancement of cooperation among Member States through the practical implementation of the relevant international conventions against terrorism and by bringing terrorist criminals to justice. As the organ with the primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, the Security Council should also play a leading role in that respect.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">The United States has come up against an unprecedented act of aggression of international terrorism. On behalf of the Russian leadership, we would like to express our most sincere and deepest condolences to all of the victims and to the people and Government of the United States of America.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Yesterday's events in the United States transcends national borders. It is a brazen challenge to all of humankind. What took place on 11 September once again highlights the timeliness of the task of joining the efforts of the entire international community in combating terror, this plague of the twenty-first century. This task was set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1269(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1269 (1999)</a>, which was unanimously adopted at the initiative of Russia.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">Yesterday's statement by the Council and the draft resolution we are adopting today demonstrate unconditionally the resolve of Council members to do all they can to leave not one terrorist act unpunished and to increase efforts to prevent and end terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">In a statement of 11 September, President Vladimir Putin said:</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">"Russia knows very well what terror is and so we understand better than most the feelings of the American people. On behalf of Russia, I turn to the people of the United States of America. I would like to say that we are with you, we are in full solidarity with your feelings of grief and we support you."</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Miss Durrant</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa01">We meet in the Security Council today at a time when the will of the international community is being severely tested. The horrible acts of terrorism perpetrated yesterday on American soil have plunged our entire world into an unprecedented period of peril, fear and uncertainty. Jamaica roundly condemns these dastardly acts. We share the shock, grief and anger of the Government and people of the United States of America, who have suffered untold casualties and enormous material damage from these highly coordinated terrorist attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa02">The masterminds and those found to be in collusion must be brought to justice. The global community must demonstrate a solid front in our struggle to defeat international terrorism. We believe that the most effective response continues to be full cooperation at the international level, as terrorism poses a serious threat to the peace and stability of nations and to the well-being of all our citizens.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa03">On behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica, I wish to convey our sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to the Government and people of the United States of America and, in particular, to those who lost their loved ones or who were injured as a result of yesterday's heinous acts.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa04">Jamaica's Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. P. J. Patterson,  has  already  conveyed  these  sentiments to President George Bush on behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica. Today's meeting undoubtedly serves as an important opportunity for the Security Council to reaffirm its condemnation of terrorism, and we wish to express our strong support for the draft resolution that has been placed before us for adoption. We also support the call for the issue of terrorism to be addressed once again by the Council -- this time at the highest level -- in the near future.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ahsan</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The Government and the people of Bangladesh are shocked at the despicable, cowardly acts of terrorism committed yesterday in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. We are overwhelmed by the enormous toll in innocent human lives, destruction and damage in cities that these horrific attacks have taken. The Government of Bangladesh has condemned these attacks in the strongest terms in a statement released yesterday. On behalf on my Government, I express our deep condolences to the bereaved families and our sympathy for those affected by this catastrophe.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">These attacks represent an affront to humanity and a challenge to the international community. We must collectively face this challenge. Bangladesh reiterates its full support to international efforts in combating all acts of terrorism. My delegation fully endorses the resolution before us.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kolby</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the Norwegian people and Government, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the President, the Government and the people of the United States of America. Many lives were lost in yesterday's senseless and cowardly acts against innocent people. Our thoughts and prayers are with all citizens of this country, and I would like to assure the United States that Norway stands ready, both as a member of the community of nations and as a close friend and ally, to assist you in every way possible.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">Yesterday's attacks were not only directed against targets in the United States, but against freedom and democracy itself. The shameless terror was an effort to undermine the values that constitute the very foundations of the civilized world. The attacks were therefore directed against all of us.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">President Bush has made it clear that the United States will ensure that the perpetrators of these horrific attacks will be pursued and will face the full might of the law.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">It is important that a unified Security Council now take appropriate steps. This Council was established to defend these values and must show that it is ready to support efforts to do just that.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">11 September 2001 is a day that will live in history -- not because terrorists managed to shake the foundations of democracy, but because it was once again proved that democracy and freedom will prevail against all evil. Countless people among the members of the New York police and fire departments and rescue workers here in the city and in Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania proved themselves to be true heroes. We are grateful to them all, and we all feel like true New Yorkers today.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa01">I should like to extend to the delegation of the United States our deepest sympathy and solidarity on the tragedy that occurred yesterday. We share with the delegation of the United States and its Government the conviction that this is an attack not only against this country but also against the community of civilized peoples, the values of humanity and a future of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa02">I should like to echo the words of the statement made yesterday by the Government of Colombia condemning and rejecting these cowardly attacks. Nothing can justify thousands of innocent victims paying with their lives for the intolerance and hatred of a group of extremists.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa03">Let me say also that on the initiative of Colombia, just yesterday in Lima the annual meeting of the Organization of American States adopted a vigorous condemnation of terrorist attacks and expressed the need to strengthen hemispheric cooperation to combat this scourge, which yesterday shook the entire world and the community of nations of the Western hemisphere.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa04">I wish to propose a thought on the regular activities of both the Security Council and the United Nations in general in light of the terrorist acts of yesterday. It should be our understanding that anything that means unnecessarily interrupting our regular work will be a victory for those criminals who organized the barbarous acts of yesterday that bring us to meet today. It is a reality that additional security measures are needed both in New York and at facilities where the United Nations operates in this city. However, I wish to make an appeal that we respond with greater commitment, with greater presence and with additional effort in our search for the decisions that the international community of nations is expecting, the community that both members and non-members of the Council represent. Thus, we will be giving the best possible response to those who simply cannot prevail.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa05">Finally, may I express my delegation's willingness to participate with all members of the Council in the adoption of immediate measures in keeping with the responsibilities of the Council under the Charter.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of France, before giving the floor to the last speaker, Ambassador Cunningham of the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Yesterday, together with the entire population of New York and all the American people, we experienced a day of horror, a day of terror that shall forever leave its mark upon our lives. The scourge of terrorism from which most of our countries have suffered undoubtedly destroyed, on 11 September, thousands of innocent American lives.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Like all of the European Union, whose ministers have just forcefully expressed themselves, France stands side by side with the United States in this time of trial. We convey to all of the victims of the families and to the American people our condolences and express our fraternal solidarity.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">In the face of what constitutes an attack upon all of humanity, as the Secretary-General has just said, in the face of an attack against the values and principles that unite us and which our Charter embodies, it is a time for unity and resolve.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">All together, we must say that nothing anywhere can ever justify resort to terrorism. All together, we must take the view that the monstrous acts committed yesterday are a challenge to the international community as a whole. Yes, we stand with the United States in deciding upon any appropriate action to combat those who resort to terrorism, those who aid them and those who protect them. A global strategy is needed. The Security Council is the principal organ entrusted with international peace and security. It should work on this in a spirit of urgency.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">I want to thank the Secretary-General, the members of the Council and you, Mr. President, for their kind words, their support and resolve and their condolences to the American people on this dark day. We appreciate the many expressions of concern and support that we have received from around the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with the many who died in the attacks and their families, with the injured and with the many brave fire-department, emergency-services and police personnel here in New York who perished and those who continue to work feverishly even as we speak in response to the attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">Last night, President Bush eloquently addressed the nation and the world on yesterday's outrage. As others have noted, this was an assault not just on the United States, but on all of us who support peace and democracy and the values for which the United Nations stands.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">The United States has suffered a cowardly and evil attack, but America is not, and will not be, shaken in its resolve. We will grieve, and we will heal.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">We look to all those who stand for peace, justice and security in the world to stand together with the United States to win the war against terrorism. We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbour them. We will bring those responsible to account.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Yesterday's horrifying images, burned now into the global memory, serve as a constant reminder to all of the need to stamp out this scourge and of the need for determination and action to do so.</p>
