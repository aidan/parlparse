	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">I wish to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-2006-989.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2006/989</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 18 December 2006 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">After consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms the importance of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> as well as its other resolutions concerning threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts, and calls on States to implement their obligations under those resolutions as a matter of priority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its call on States to become parties to all relevant international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, and to make full use of the sources of assistance and guidance which are available.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council further reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council reminds States that they must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council recognizes the importance of cross-United Nations cooperation on counter-terrorism issues, and confirms that it stands ready to play its part in the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-288.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 60/288</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council calls upon the relevant United Nations departments, programmes and specialized agencies, as appropriate, to consider, within their existing mandates, how to pursue counter-terrorism objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council welcomes the Counter-Terrorism Committee's renewed focus on enhancing implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> through a proactive fulfilment of its mandate to promote and monitor States' implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">"The Security Council recalls its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1624 (2005)</a> and encourages the Counter-Terrorism Committee to continue its work on implementation of this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">"The Security Council calls on the Counter-Terrorism Committee to report on the status of implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In particular, the Security Council encourages the Counter-Terrorism Committee to report to the Council on any outstanding issues, when necessary and on a regular basis, in order to receive strategic guidance from the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">"The Security Council recalls its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a> by which it decided to establish the Counter- Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED) as a special political mission under the policy guidance of the Committee, to enhance the Committee's ability to monitor implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and effectively continue the capacity-building work in which it was engaged. The Security Council stresses that the mandate of the Counter-Terrorism Committee's Executive Directorate flows from that of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">"The Security Council further recalls its presidential statement <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-64.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/64</a>, which included the conclusions of the Council's comprehensive review of CTED in 2005, and decided to carry out another comprehensive review of CTED by 31 December 2006, prepared by the Counter-Terrorism Committee. During today's consultations, the Security Council endorsed the report prepared by the Committee and forwarded to the Council in <a href="../pdf/S-2006-989.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2006/989</a> and agreed with its recommendations and conclusions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa17">"The Security Council welcomes the letter from the Secretary-General dated 15 December 2006 with regard to CTED's reporting lines. The Council has considered this matter and endorses the Counter-Terrorism Committee's recommendation with regard to CTED's reporting lines so that CTED would henceforth present its draft work programmes and its semi-annual reports directly to the Committee. "The Security Council notes with appreciation the enhanced cooperation among its three Committees -- 1267, CTC and 1540 -- that deal with counter-terrorism and their expert teams. It encourages the three Committees to ensure that, in their dialogue with States, they present a consolidated message from the Council on its efforts to fight terrorism. Also, it encourages the three Committees and their expert teams to avoid duplication, including in their requests for information from Member States about their implementation. In this regard, it encourages the three Committees and their expert teams to continue to strengthen the sharing of information among themselves, specifically information reported by States regarding implementation. The Council will continue to evaluate how its counter-terrorism efforts can be organized most efficiently."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa18">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-56.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/56</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa19">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
