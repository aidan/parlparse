	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">Under the item on its agenda, the Security Council will now begin its consideration of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members concerning the application of the Kingdom of Tonga for admission to membership in the United Nations, which appears in <a href="../pdf/S-1999-823.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/823</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">In paragraph 3 of the report, the Committee recommends to the Council that it should have recourse to the provision of the last paragraph of rule 60 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure in order to present its recommendation to the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Council wishes to waive the time limits set forth in the penultimate paragraph of rule 60.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">In paragraph 4 of the report, the Committee recommends to the Security Council the adoption of a draft resolution on the application of the Kingdom of Tonga for admission to membership in the United Nations. I should like to congratulate the Committee on its unanimous decision to recommend that the Kingdom of Tonga be admitted to membership in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">In accordance with the understanding reached in prior consultations among members of the Council, I propose that the Council adopt the draft resolution contained in paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">As I see no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">I therefore declare that the draft resolution contained in paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members, <a href="../pdf/S-1999-823.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/823</a>, has been adopted without a vote as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1253(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1253 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">I shall immediately convey the decision of the Security Council recommending the admission of the Kingdom of Tonga to membership in the United Nations to the Secretary-General for transmittal to the General Assembly in accordance with rule 60 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">I shall now make a statement, in my capacity as President of the Security Council, on behalf of the members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council has decided to recommend to the General Assembly that the Kingdom of Tonga be admitted as a Member of the United Nations. On behalf of the members of the Security Council, I wish to extend my congratulations to the Kingdom of Tonga on this historic occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Council notes with great satisfaction the Kingdom of Tonga's solemn commitment to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to fulfil all the obligations contained therein. We look forward to the day in the near future when the Kingdom of Tonga will join us as a Member of the United Nations and to working closely with its representatives."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1999-23.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1999/23</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">The Council has thus concluded its consideration of the matter before it.</p>
