	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Beirut on 19 September 2007 which killed at least seven persons, including Member of Parliament Antoine Ghanem. The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the people and Government of Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council commends the determination and commitment of the Government of Lebanon to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of this and other assassinations and underlines its determination to support the Government of Lebanon in its efforts to this end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its condemnation of all targeted assassinations of Lebanese leaders, including since October 2004, and demands an immediate end of the use of intimidation and violence against the representatives of the Lebanese people and institutions. On the eve of the crucial period of the presidential election, it stresses that any attempt to destabilize Lebanon, including through political assassination or other terrorist acts, should not impede or subvert the constitutional process in Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reiterates, in this context, its call for the holding of a free and fair presidential election in conformity with Lebanese constitutional norms and schedules and without any foreign interference, fully respecting the sovereignty of Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council emphasizes the importance of the unity of all the Lebanese people and of the pursuit of dialogue among all of the country's political parties. It reiterates its full support to all ongoing efforts in Lebanon to combat terrorism, solidify democratic institutions through national dialogue, and continue to extend the authority of the Lebanese Government throughout its territory."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-34.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/34</a>.</p>
