<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Listre</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">It is a source of great satisfaction for me to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.39.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/L.39</a> on behalf of the members of the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">Since it was established, in 1986, the zone has been an excellent forum for carrying out discussions and expanding the links of cooperation and friendship between African and Latin American coastal States of the South Atlantic. Argentina is pleased with the achievements reached in the implementation of the objectives the countries of the zone set for themselves 14 years ago. To date, we have held five high-level meetings, the last of which was held in Argentina in October 1998. Argentina's offer to host such an important meeting was due to my country's interest in securing peace in the zone and promoting cooperative relations among its members.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The States members of the zone have set clear objectives for ourselves in such basic areas as the strengthening of peace and security, finding peaceful and negotiated solutions to all current disagreements in the region, promoting democracy, good governance and respect for human rights, fostering trade and investment between the Latin American and African members of the zone, protecting the environment and living marine resources, cooperating in the fight against drug trafficking and developing the concept of solidarity in humanitarian emergencies.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">With regard to peace and security, my country believes that nuclear-weapon-free zones such as those envisioned in the Treaties of Tlatelolco and Pelindaba, creating areas in which the use or threat of use of such weapons is proscribed, contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">With regard to the proliferation of, and illicit trafficking in, small arms, the countries of the zone are convinced that peacemaking and peacekeeping should be fostered while limiting as much as possible the diversion of human and financial resources to armaments. The characteristics of the phenomenon of small arms proliferation vary from region to region. Thus, measures to deal with this issue should conform to the circumstances of the region concerned. Fortunately, the countries of the zone share a firm commitment, as set out in various worthwhile initiatives put forth in the inter-American and African contexts, to combat the illicit traffic and manufacture of small arms.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">With regard to these issues, I would like to reiterate once again the call for the entire international community to cooperate with the zone's goals and to avoid taking actions that could create or aggravate situations of tension or possible conflict in the region. In this context, my country calls on all States to focus their efforts on resolving the current disputes in the South Atlantic in a peaceful, just and lasting way, in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">Argentina once again wishes to reaffirm its conviction that the goals of peace and cooperation underpinning the spirit of the zone will be realized only if there is full respect in the countries of the region for the institutions of representative democracy and for human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this context, we are pleased with the progress made in the last year with regard to restoring and consolidating good governance and transparency in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa08">Argentina believes that peace and development issues are interdependent and inseparable. It is therefore important to promote technical and economic cooperation, trade and investment among the members of the zone. In this regard, we view with satisfaction the achievements attained by the members of the zone in the areas of economic stability, State modernization, the opening up of markets and the privatization of State-owned companies.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa09">We consider it a good sign that most of the States members of the zone have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as that illustrates a commitment to the preservation of fish species. In that regard, although the Convention establishes a regulatory framework for the protection of living marine resources, some of the provisions of the Convention should be complemented by those of the 1995 United Nations Agreement relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks on the high seas, whose entry into force is essential.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa10">Another issue to which Argentina would like to draw attention is that of the transport of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and highly radioactive wastes. In that regard, I wish to express the concern of my country and of other coastal States about the risks entailed in the transit of ships carrying these sorts of wastes in the South Atlantic. We believe that the interests of coastal States should be taken into account when international regulations in this area are established.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa11">The fight against drug trafficking and related crimes requires a concerted effort by the international community. Argentina therefore reiterates its willingness to cooperate towards achieving the objectives the zone set for itself in Somerset West in 1996 and in Argentina in 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa12">With regard to international humanitarian assistance, I would like to highlight the progress made in the "White Helmets" initiative, which was proposed to the international community and which has been dealt with in various resolutions of the General Assembly. White Helmets have provided assistance in various countries of the zone, including Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa13">I cannot conclude without acknowledging the generous offer made by Benin to host the sixth high-level meeting of the members of the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa14">Finally, I would like to invite all delegations present, in view of the noble objectives of the zone, to lend their support to draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.39.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/L.39</a>.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Moura</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">We thank the Secretary-General for the report contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-476.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/476</a>, which records the activities of many organs of the United Nations system in the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">Since the States members of the zone held their fifth ministerial meeting, at Buenos Aires in October 1998, we have seen a consolidation of the role of the zone as a framework for cooperation, linking countries on the two shores of the South Atlantic. The zone is an instrument that supplements other institutions and arrangements and that provides its member States with mechanisms to better coordinate their action in facing common problems. Three priority areas are at the core of our efforts within the zone: preserving the denuclearized status of the region, protecting the marine environment and cooperating in the fight against illegal drug trafficking. We recall that in 1994 the members of the zone, on the initiative of Brazil, adopted a declaration on the denuclearization of the South Atlantic, which was later endorsed at the fourth and the fifth ministerial meetings.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">With regard to cooperation in protecting the marine environment and the conservation of the living resources of the sea, Brazil is working bilaterally and multilaterally with its neighbours to finalize our respective proposals on the delimitation of the continental shelf under our jurisdictions. Brazil favours the adoption of new mechanisms within the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea that would help prevent environmental accidents and would promote exchanges of information and concerted action.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">The combat against drug trafficking should continue to be actively pursued; the zone can provide a framework for active cooperation in that area. The countries of the zone formally launched an anti-drug initiative at their fourth ministerial meeting, held in South Africa in April 1996. Subsequently, they moved to adopt measures proposed by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The countries of the zone are also pursuing bilateral agreements among themselves, cooperating to increase the effectiveness of their efforts against this form of organized crime.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa05">The international community and the United Nations system, especially the United Nations Development Programme and the international financial institutions, have an important role to play in assisting the countries of the zone to further those objectives. The zone works as a catalyst for the promotion of dialogue and cooperation among the countries of the Atlantic coast of Africa, western Africa and South America. Each side of the Atlantic can benefit from the other's experience in the promotion of democratic values, the expansion of trade, investment and sea links, and the intensification of South-South cooperation. We expect that this process will be further advanced at the sixth meeting, possibly to be held next year. In that regard, Brazil warmly welcomes the offer of Benin to host the sixth meeting of member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa06">The zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic can also serve as a forum where organizations such as the Southern Common Market, the Southern African Development Community, the Economic Community of West African States, the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and the Economic Community of Central African States can pool their efforts to build peace and prosperity in our area of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa07">Brazil is a sponsor of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.39.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/L.39</a>, which was just introduced by the Permanent Representative of Argentina. We are confident that the draft resolution will be supported by an overwhelming majority of Member States.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tapia</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">On behalf of its 80 sponsors, I have the honour to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.40.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/L.40</a>, entitled "Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development and of the special session of the General Assembly in this regard". The following countries have joined the original sponsors listed in that document: Australia, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Mali, Malta, the Philippines, San Marino and the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">On 1 July 2000, at Geneva, the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly came to an end. The session followed more than a year of preparations and negotiations. There, the States Members of the United Nations reaffirmed their commitment to place people at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development. They assessed the progress achieved since the World Summit in Copenhagen and agreed on new actions and initiatives to continue with the implementation of its outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">The negotiations in Geneva were not easy, and, as is always the case in this type of process, there were aspects on which no agreement could be reached. Nevertheless, in the main it was possible to reach extremely important consensus agreements that will provide guidelines for the work to be accomplished in the field of social by Governments over the next few years.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">The international community should be proud of those consensus agreements. But we will be even prouder once we have been able to eradicate poverty, create employment for all, and ensure a dignified and secure place for every member of our societies.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">The text we are introducing today is of a more procedural nature than those that have been presented in earlier years, because of the short period of time that has passed since the conclusion of the twenty-fourth special session and this session of the General Assembly. Its procedural nature is designed to reaffirm the agreements achieved by Governments at Copenhagen and Geneva, and to provide continuity for this topic within the United Nations system by inviting the Secretary-General, the Economic and Social Council, the Commission for Social Development, the regional commissions, relevant organizations, the funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental forums to grant priority to the adoption of those measures required for the effective implementation of all the commitments and undertakings set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action and in the outcome document of the twenty-fourth special session.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">The draft resolution also expresses its deep appreciation to the Government and people of Switzerland for contributing to the successful outcome of the Geneva session. Finally, the draft requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session a report on this question.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">Although the text is of a procedural nature, negotiations thereon were not without their difficulties. This attests to the complexity of the topic and should serve as a warning in respect of future efforts in this area. We hope that future negotiations will continue to be marked by the lofty perspective that has always characterized the manner in which the topic of social development in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">Finally, Chile would like to convey its most sincere gratitude to Mrs. Marcela Nicodemos, Counsellor of the Mission of Brazil, who led the informal consultations with her well-known effectiveness, professionalism and good humour. We also wish her the best of luck in her future endeavours.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa02">Since the publication of <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.43-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/L.43/Rev.1</a>, four additional co-sponsors have joined us: Cuba, Guyana, Myanmar and Tunisia. This brings the total number of co-sponsors to 59.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa03">By its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-25.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 53/25</a>, the General Assembly proclaimed the decade 2001-2010 as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. In today's draft, we reaffirm the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, adopted by the General Assembly in September 1999 through its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-243.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 53/243</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa04">We are emphasizing the particular relevance of the special session of the General Assembly for the follow-up to the World Summit for Children, to the World Conference against racism and to the United Nations for Human Rights Education, having particular relevance to the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa05">In the operative paragraphs, the draft resolution recognizes that the objective of the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World is to further strengthen the global movement for a culture of peace following the observance of the International Year for the Culture of Peace in 2000 -- that is, this year. It also invites Member States to place greater emphasis on and expand their activities promoting a culture of peace and non-violence, in particular during the Decade, at the national, regional and international levels and to ensure that peace and non-violence is fostered at all levels. We note with particular pleasure that, during the International Year for the Culture of Peace, a number of countries at the national level undertook extensive activities to promote a culture of peace and non-violence.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa06">This draft resolution welcomes the establishment of national committees and national focal points in over 160 countries in the context of the observance of the International Year for the Culture of Peace and stresses the importance of their continued close involvement in furthering the objectives of the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace and in the effective observance of the Decade. The draft resolution also encourages the establishment of such bodies in the remaining countries.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa07">The draft resolution designates the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as the lead agency for the Decade with responsibility for coordinating the activities of the organizations of the United Nations system to promote a culture of peace, as well as liaison with the other organizations concerned in this matter. It recognizes the important role of relevant United Nations bodies, in particular the United Nations Children's Fund and the University for Peace, in further promoting a culture of peace and non-violence, particularly by means of special activities during the Decade at national, regional and international levels.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa08">In operative paragraph 9, the draft resolution invites civil society at the local, regional and national levels to widen the scope of their activities to promote a culture of peace and non-violence, engaging in partnerships and sharing information, thus contributing to a global movement for a culture of peace, and encourages civil society, including non-governmental organizations, to further the objectives of the Decade by adopting their own programme of activities to complement the initiatives of Member States, the organizations of the United Nations system and other global and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa09">There is a need for a technical correction in this draft resolution. I would draw the attention of the General Assembly to paragraphs 11 and 13, in which the General Assembly session referred to is mentioned as the "sixty-first session". Actually, the session in year 2005 will be the sixtieth session. Thus, in operative paragraphs 11 and 13, the words "sixty-first" should be replaced by the word "sixtieth".</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa10">I hope that, in view of the contents of this draft resolution and of the large number of sponsors, it will be possible for the Assembly to adopt it by consensus. We again thank the sponsors for joining in this draft resolution.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa01">I take the floor to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.15.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/L.15</a>/Rev. 2, entitled, "The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order," on behalf of the sponsors.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa02">As we stated before the Assembly when this item was debated on 25 October, the concept of a new global human order is aimed at promoting a new and enlightened partnership for peace and development involving all actors of the world community, based on mutual respect, democratic governance and popular participation, to deal with the challenges of development and poverty eradication and to arrest the growing disparities among and within nations. It is inspired by a vision of the enormous potential for human development created by the end of the cold war, the accelerated pace of technological development and the deepening interdependence of nations. At the same time, it is dictated by the realization that this potential remains virtually untapped and that instead, over the last two decades, there has been a gradual but definite displacement of development from the international policy agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa03">The reason for this gap between expectations and reality and for the failure of development policies is not hard to understand for, while every international agreement reached during the past decade -- from Rio's Agenda 21 to the recently adopted Millennium Declaration -- has highlighted the importance of certain fundamental human values for the successful pursuit of development, the prevailing paradigm, based as it is on globalization and economic neo-liberalism, is devoid of any humanistic consideration and, consequently, of any real prospect for success.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa04">The initiative of a new global human order is thus an attempt to identify and address the gaps in international cooperation that have impeded the effective implementation of the many initiatives on development pursued by the United Nations and the international community. It is also an effort to come to grips with the core questions of political will and resources. Equally important, it is an endeavour to instil a spirit of humanism into the Agenda for Development so that all may be able to benefit from the new economic forces of globalization.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa05">As experience has clearly shown by now, the complex issue of development cannot be addressed by the continued pursuit of old models and strategies that are inappropriate to the new era in which we live. Nor can it simply be farmed out to the market, which is merely the servant, and not the master, of human endeavour. It is a challenge that requires a serious dialogue among Governments, based not only on political and economic considerations, but also on ethical and moral principles capable of creating a new basis for international cooperation that is both humane and just. Such a dialogue, we believe, should ideally be undertaken here at the United Nations, which because of the universality of its Charter has an obligation to take the lead in resolving these issues.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa06">The draft resolution before us thus departs from a recognition of the important role that the United Nations must play in the creation of a new global human order. It recognizes the centrality of the well-being of people and the full development of their potential to the overall goal of sustainable development. It points to the growing disparities between rich and poor in both the North and the South, which speak to our common humanity and beg our common concern. The draft resolution therefore reflects a common determination to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples and a sense of urgency for the revitalization of international cooperation to that end. At the same time, the draft resolution expressly emphasizes the principle of responsibility on the part of countries for their development processes.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa07">In the preambular paragraphs particular attention is drawn to the goals and targets agreed upon in the Millennium Declaration, which provide, we believe, an important impetus for renewed action by the international community to promote development and poverty eradication. The draft resolution also takes note of the Declaration of the South Summit, in which leaders of the South, after reviewing the current state of international economic relations, expressed the need for a new global human order.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa08">The operative part of the text stresses the need for a broad-based consensus for action, within a comprehensive and holistic framework, towards the achievement of the goals of development and poverty eradication. The Secretary-General is accordingly requested to seek the views of Member States, as well as agencies and organizations of the United Nations system, on the promotion of a new global human order. On the basis of these submissions, the Assembly will then be able to determine what the essential components of this new order should be and what further steps should be taken for its creation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa09">I wish to inform the Assembly that the Government of Guyana, in bringing this initiative to the attention of the Assembly, has offered some preliminary ideas, contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-55-229.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/229</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-55-496.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/496</a>. This contribution is made with a view to sparking the discussion and to providing an indication of the kinds of issues that may be considered, without prejudice to the ideas that other Member States and the United Nations agencies may have.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa10">I should also note the decision to resume the debate on the item not at the fifty-sixth session, but at the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This has been agreed to by the sponsors in response to the concerns of a few delegations that have contended that the proposal might duplicate or disturb processes already under way. As I have previously stated, and as is implied in the preambular paragraphs of the draft resolution, it is our hope that these efforts will bear fruit. However, past experience and present circumstances do not allow us to be sanguine about their outcome. In any case, the issue we have raised here is a much larger one -- namely, the creation of a new partnership, indeed a new paradigm, for development based on justice and equity, mutual respect and mutual advantage.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa11">Finally, I should mention that the draft resolution before the Assembly is the result of extensive consultations with Member States and represents an accommodation of the various concerns of the delegations that participated in these discussions. In thanking them, and especially the sponsors, for their cooperation and support, I now commend draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.15-Rev.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/L.15/Rev.2</a> to the Assembly for adoption by consensus.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Snyder</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa01">Effectively responding to the challenges of achieving sustainable development and increasing human well-being in all countries is an important United States Government goal. Because of this interest, the United States Government is closely involved in discussions of the many relevant development issues at United Nations meetings and other appropriate forums.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa02">While we understand the motivations lying behind this resolution, we believe it duplicates many other ongoing international initiatives related to sustainable development objectives. The United States Government is concerned by the potential of this resolution to lead towards non-productive and duplicative discussions in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa03">The United Nations documents accompanying this resolution, <a href="../pdf/A-55-229.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/229</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-55-496.pdf" class="pdf">A/55/496</a>, in explaining the strategy for promoting a new global human order, call for the implementation of specific policies to which the United States Government is strongly opposed. These include enlarging United Nations responsibilities beyond the bounds of the United Nations Charter and infringing on the agreed mandates of other international institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa04">The same documents concentrate almost exclusively on international responsibility for achieving economic growth in developing countries. They do not address the dramatic differences in economic performance among developing countries over the past four decades. Many developing countries have achieved unprecedented income growth and poverty reduction during that period, with per capita income rising at much higher rates than in industrialized countries. Many other developing countries have only suffered economic stagnation, although they operated within the same international system and sometimes started with population and natural resource bases equivalent to those of more successful countries. Why was this so? The new global human order, as presented here, ignores this key function.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa05">We believe the lack of balance at the core of the new global human order proposal threatens to revive sterile past debates on important development questions at a time when there have been significant changes in thinking at both national and international levels concerning the best routes towards sustainable development for all. There is general agreement that pragmatic, practical solutions are needed most now. We hope that the report resulting from this resolution will take such considerations fully into account.</p>
