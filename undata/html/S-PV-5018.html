	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">the Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the signature, on 30 July 2004 in Accra, by the President of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, the Prime Minister of the Government of National Reconciliation, Mr. Seydou Elimane Diarra, and all the political forces of Côte d'Ivoire, of an agreement (the "Accra III Agreement") that consolidates the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis process. It recalls that it endorsed the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. It welcomes the resolute commitment of the African heads of State and Government, in particular of the acting Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States, Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the Republic of Ghana, and the Chairperson of the African Union, Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as well as of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the other participants to the Accra summit of 29 and 30 July 2004, thanks to which the conclusion of this agreement was made possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the spirit of dialogue and responsibility shown by President Gbagbo and each of the Ivorian parties, who have clearly demonstrated their willingness to lead the political process in Côte d'Ivoire to its completion. It welcomes the concrete measures agreed upon by the signatories of the Accra III Agreement, with a view to facilitating the full and comprehensive implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and because of the serious threats, caused by the continuing crisis, which persist against the territorial integrity of Côte d'Ivoire. It urges the parties to adhere strictly to the deadlines that have been fixed, in particular to settle the issue of eligibility for the presidency of the Republic and to start the disarmament, in accordance with the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, of all paramilitary groups and militias, and to disband disruptive youth groups.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council urges all parties to implement in good faith, without delays or preconditions, the obligations they have undertaken in signing the Accra III Agreement. It calls upon them in particular to remain committed so that open, free and transparent elections could be held, as agreed, before the end of 2005. It reaffirms its complete readiness to take any appropriate measure against individuals who impede the full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council takes note with profound concern of the preliminary results of the investigation led by the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire of the massacres that occurred in Korhogo. It reiterates its firm condemnation of all atrocities and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in Côte d'Ivoire and in particular those that occurred on 25 and 26 March 2004 in Abidjan. It reiterates its full support to the international commission of inquiry put in place by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in order to establish the facts and circumstances of the perpetration of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law which occurred in Côte d'Ivoire since 19 September 2002 and, as far as possible, to identify their authors. It recalls that all persons responsible for such violations will be brought to justice. It encourages the Ivorian parties to establish without further delay, as they have committed themselves to, the National Commission for Human Rights provided for by the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its intention to continue to follow closely developments of the situation in Côte d'Ivoire and the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. It emphasizes in this regard the importance of the follow-up mechanism and looks forward to the regular reports provided for in the Accra III Agreement of 30 July 2004. It requests in this regard the Secretary-General to keep the Council regularly informed about the implementation of commitments under the Accra III Agreement."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-29.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/29</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
