	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk09-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of 77 and China in explanation of vote on agenda item 119, entitled "Programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk09-pa02">The Group of 77 and China welcomes the conclusion of the deliberations on the issue of modalities and sustainability of the Development Account.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk09-pa03">The Group of 77 and China welcomes the conclusion of negotiations on the issue after difficult and lengthy deliberations on the matter. In this process, the Group demonstrated a spirit of cooperation and understanding in seeking consensus on this matter and looks forward to the continuation of this spirit in further negotiations in the Fifth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk09-pa04">The Group's understanding of paragraph 2 of the resolution is that the cumulative savings achieved as a result of efficiency measures will be transferred to the Development Account section in the budget, with prior approval of the General Assembly, and will form the maintenance base of the budget section relating to the Development Account for subsequent bienniums.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk09-pa05">The Group would once again like to reaffirm its position that the operation of the Development Account should be in accordance with the relevant regulations and rules of the Organization, since it is part of the regular budget. Further, it must neither be a budget- nor a staff-reduction exercise.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk09-pa06">We would also like to stress that the correlation being sought between the Development Account and efficiency measures is not appropriate. Improved efficiency and effectiveness are essential to strengthen the Organization's capacity to fulfil its role and must not be trivialized. The Group is of the view that arbitrary proposals for savings during the formulation and implementation phases of the budget should be avoided, since they can have an adverse impact on programme delivery. Therefore, we would like to reaffirm that the exercise of improving efficiency in the Organization must ensure the full implementation of all mandated programmes and activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk09-pa07">Finally, we would like to request the Secretary-General to submit proposals for the use of the funds during this session, as recommended by the Committee for Programme and Coordination. The projects approved should be fully implemented in accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk10-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated countries Cyprus and Malta, as well as the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country member of the European Economic Area (EEA) Norway align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk10-pa02">I would first like to thank the representative of Uganda, Mr. Nester Odaga-Jalomayo, for his outstanding work as coordinator for this draft resolution. Our deep appreciation also goes to his predecessor, Mr. Humayun Kabir of Bangladesh.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk10-pa03">The European Union is pleased that we have adopted by consensus the draft resolution in document <a href="../pdf/A-54-508.pdf">A/54/508</a>, dealing with the modalities for operating the Development Account. The preservation of consensus in the Fifth Committee on budgetary matters is of great importance to the European Union. It works to the advantage of all Member States and serves the common good of the United Nations. It means an approach of win-win and not zero-sum.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk10-pa04">The European Union has from the outset supported the concept of the Development Account, as launched by the Secretary-General as part of his Track II reform package. We have also consistently supported the Secretary-General's proposals on the modalities and sustainability of the Account. The resolution adequately reflects these proposals. The Account is of a multi-year character, which provides for increased flexibility in the use of funds. It does not amount to a budget- or staff-reduction exercise. It excludes an <i>ex ante </i>approval of the efficiency measures.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk10-pa05">The adoption of this resolution will now enable the Secretary-General to come up with detailed proposals for the projects to be funded from the Account during the next biennium. We look forward to the submission of these proposals and expect that they will have succinct objectives, measurable outcomes and clear performance indicators and that they will complement existing programmes.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa04">We also consider that the resources allocated to this section should not be utilized to fund activities that are normally funded through extrabudgetary sources.

	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk17-pa01">My delegation fully welcomes the adoption of the resolution on the financing the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET). Its adoption is critical for enabling the Mission to conduct its mandated activities in a timely fashion and fully reflects the international character of the Organization, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter, as well as the rules and regulations that govern such missions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk17-pa02">We firmly believe that it is the obligation of all Member States to safeguard the good name, credibility and capability of the United Nations so as to maintain the international community's trust in the Organization. It is critically important that the United Nations, in keeping with its central characteristic of being representative of all Member States, is enabled to effectively conduct its activities at the field level.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk17-pa03">It is our view that the success or failure of the Mission will very much depend on the staff of the Mission itself, and they will represent the Organization itself. Obviously, if the staff of the Mission conduct their mandated activities in a neutral and impartial manner, this would be a key element in maintaining the character of the Organization. This is even more urgent since most of the activities of the United Nations in the region are in the conflict area.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk17-pa04">In this regard, I would like to stress that in order for the Mission to be successful, it is important that it be well prepared and well organized, both at Headquarters and in the field.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk17-pa05">As host country for the United Nations Mission in East Timor, we are fully committed to the success of the Mission and have not failed to show our cooperation in this regard. Thus my delegation welcomes the assurances of the Secretariat that the host country's contribution in providing the necessary facilities and premises to the Mission, thereby enabling it to avail itself of significant savings, will be reflected in the next performance report.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk17-pa06">Finally, my delegation would like to end by expressing our sincere appreciation to Mr. Ahmed Darwish of Egypt, in his capacity as coordinator, for his remarkable efforts in forging a consensus resolution on this issue.</div>
