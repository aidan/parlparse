<p><b>The President </b>(<i>spoke in French</i>): As indicated in document <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/59/788">A/59/788</a>, as a result of the resignation of Mr. Christopher Thomas of Trinidad and Tobago, the General Assembly is required, at its fifty-ninth session, to appoint a person to serve as a member of the Joint Inspection Unit for a period expiring on 31 December 2008.</p>

The candidate, in accordance with General Assembly <a href="http://seagrass.goatchurch.org.uk/~undocs/cgi-bin/getundoc.py?doc=A/RES/59/267">resolution 59/267</a> of 23 December 2004, should have experience in at least one of the following fields -- oversight, audit, inspection, investigation, evaluation, finance, project evaluation, programme evaluation, human resources management, management, public administration, monitoring and/or programme performance -- as well as knowledge of the United Nations system and of its role in international relations.</p>
