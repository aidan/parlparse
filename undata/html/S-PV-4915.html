	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Somalia, documents <a href="../pdf/S-2004-115.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/115</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2004-115-Corr.1.pdf" class="pdf">Corr.1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council, recalling its previous decisions concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular the statement of its President of 11 November 2003 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-19.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/19</a>), and welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of February 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-115.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/115</a>), reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia, and its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of the country, consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its firm support for the Somali national reconciliation process and the ongoing Somalia National Reconciliation Conference in Kenya, launched under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council commends President Mwai Kibaki of Kenya, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, other leaders of IGAD, and international supporters of the Somalia National Reconciliation Conference for their perseverance to help Somalis reach national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the signing, on 29 January 2004, of the Declaration on the Harmonization of the Various Issues Proposed by the Somali Delegates at the Somali Consultative Meetings, held from 9 to 29 January 2004 in Nairobi, as an important step towards lasting peace and reconciliation in Somalia, and urges all signatories to the agreement to fully abide by their commitment to take forward the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council calls upon the Somali parties to build on the progress achieved and swiftly conclude the Somalia National Reconciliation Conference with a durable and inclusive solution to the conflict in Somalia by establishing a viable transitional government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates that the Somali parties should abide by and implement expeditiously the Eldoret Declaration of 27 October 2002 on cessation of hostilities, and calls on the Somali parties to continue working towards a comprehensive security arrangement for Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council stresses the urgent need for a comprehensive ceasefire throughout Somalia, and that the Somali parties themselves bear the responsibility of achieving it. The Council calls on the Somali parties to fully implement the ceasefire, to ensure security and to resolve their differences through peaceful means.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council condemns those who obstruct the peace process, and stresses that those who persist on the path of confrontation and conflict will be held accountable. The Council will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council calls upon all neighbouring States to continue their endeavour to participate fully and constructively for the success of the Somali national reconciliation process and the attainment of peace in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council welcomes the commitment and preparation of the African Union to deploy a military observer mission to Somalia, and calls upon the international community to support the African Union's efforts to improve the security situation in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council calls on the international community to continue its efforts to support IGAD in its facilitation of the Somalia National Reconciliation Conference, and calls on the donor countries to contribute to the Conference, the United Nations Trust Fund for Peace-building in Somalia and the United Nations consolidated inter-agency appeal for Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">"The Security Council expresses serious concern regarding the humanitarian situation in Somalia, and calls on the Somali leaders to facilitate the delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance and to assure the safety of all international and national aid workers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">"The Security Council reiterates its concern over the continued flow of weapons and ammunition supplies to Somalia, welcomes the establishment of the Monitoring Group pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1519(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1519 (2003)</a> of 16 December 2003, and calls on relevant States and entities to comply scrupulously with the arms embargo and to cooperate with the Monitoring Group.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">"The Security Council welcomes the readiness of the Secretary-General to enhance the attention of the United Nations to developments in Somalia within existing resources. The Council reiterates that a comprehensive peace-building programme with special emphasis on disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration will be important to post-conflict Somalia as stipulated in the statement of its President of 28 March 2002 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-8.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/8</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to consider and to suggest in his next report ways to develop the role of the United Nations in support of the IGAD-facilitated Somali reconciliation process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa19">"The Security Council reiterates its readiness to assist the Somali parties and support IGAD in implementation of the agreements reached in the Somalia National Reconciliation Conference."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa20">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-3.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/3</a>.</p>
