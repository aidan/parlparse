	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk04-pa01">I wish to put on record the position of my delegation on the draft resolutions recommended by the Third Committee under agenda item 112 (c), which relate to the human rights situation in various States. Since its founding, the Republic of Yemen has consistently pursued a policy of respect for and of upholding human rights. It has opted for democracy and political pluralism; it has laid down laws and legislative rules that enable its citizens to exercise their intellectual, social, economic and political rights and freedoms in accordance with prevailing laws and the Constitution.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk06-pa01">It conducted the first free parliamentary elections in 1993, and it is now preparing for local government elections under the law on local government. In addition, it paved the way for freedom of the press and for the political pluralism that has given rise to the emergence of more than 20 political organizations and parties.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk06-pa02">At the international level, Yemen acceded to and ratified most human-rights conventions and other instruments, thus demonstrating its absolute commitment to respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and social justice for the individual. On this basis, it consistently expresses grave concern over and denunciation and condemnation of violations and breaches of human rights, regardless of where they occur. In this regard, Yemen makes no distinction between one case and another.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk06-pa03">When we examine the draft resolutions that are before the Assembly we notice that some of them embody a process of politicization of human rights, and that such politicization serves the interests of certain States at the expense of others, and thus flouts the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948 and its annexes, the two international Covenants, the Vienna Declaration and other international human-rights instruments. This is the result of selectivity -- failure to abide by norms and standards. The methods used are devoid of impartiality and objectivity. In some cases, there is interference in the internal affairs of States, and national sovereignty is infringed. This weakens credibility and endangers the concepts of human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk06-pa04">Consequently, my delegation emphasizes the need to respect national sovereignty, to avoid interfering in the internal affairs of States and to respect the beliefs, traditions and religious creeds of peoples. The extent of respect for human rights should always be measured with the same yardstick. There should be no selectivity or double standards or politicization in the case of any State. This assertion stems from our belief that commitment by States to such an approach would enhance and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms and would lead to the establishment of equitable international relations based on mutual respect and belief in the common good, in a world where justice, democracy, progress and peace prevail.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk06-pa05">Consequently, the Republic of Yemen, which believes in and cherishes the basic principles of human rights and tries to promote and protect them and, thus, to remain impartial when faced with selective, two-faced, politicized positions, will contribute to the application of standard norms and concepts in all cases, without selectivity or politicization, by not participating in the vote on draft resolutions or proposals concerning human rights in States, with the exception of those adopted by consensus.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk07-pa01">My delegation would like to state, for the record, that with regard to draft resolution XI, entitled "Situation of human rights in Cuba", on which the Assembly will take action, the Government of Colombia is pleased at the positive progress that has been made in Cuba in the area of human rights. I refer in particular to the cooperation extended by the Government of Cuba -- something that is recognized by the Special Rapporteur in his report. The ratification of the United Nations Convention against torture, the visit to the country by some non-governmental human-rights organizations and the visit by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in November 1994 are all evidence of this cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk07-pa02">Colombia cannot but welcome the agreements on migration reached by Cuba and the United States of America. These meet the need that has been felt to provide a sensible framework for migration flows. In addition, Colombia welcomes the economic reforms recently undertaken by the Cuban Government, as these will promote the well-being of Cuban society and of the Cuban people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk07-pa03">All of this is proof that it is possible, through dialogue and international cooperation, to make progress in the area of human rights.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The General Assembly is about to enter a new stage in an exercise that has been one of the worst injustices in the recent history of this Organization, thought up and imposed by the super-Power which does not conceal its efforts to crush the ideals of freedom and social justice that have inspired our country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa03">The Government of the United States is utterly devoid of the necessary political and moral authority to proclaim itself the arbiter of human rights in Cuba. In fact, despite mammoth efforts and diplomatic pressures, it has not been able to universalize its anti-Cuba concoction.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa04">How can those who have financed, organized and promoted all kinds of aggression against our people talk about human rights in Cuba? How can those who continue even to deny millions of children, women and old people access to food and medicines talk about human rights in my country?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa05">Cuba will continue to move forward along its historic road of independence and social justice; it will continue the sovereign process of changes now under way, on the basis of the consensus of the people; and it will faithfully cooperate with the United Nations, guided by the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectivity in respect of all human rights, everywhere in the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa06">The international community should put a stop to this exercise, which contributes nothing to the protection and enjoyment of human rights in Cuba. Why should such waste of so much material and human effort continue to be allowed? Why should procedures that are so necessary to the promotion and protection of human rights be allowed to be so discredited?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa07">Cuba will never accept this crude draft, however much it may be dolled up. Cuba will never accept a special rapporteur, however much he may be disguised as a neutral and independent person.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I wish to speak in explanation of vote on draft resolution XII, "Situation of human rights in Nigeria".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa02">My delegation would like to state how unhappy it is to observe that the General Assembly has been asked to take action on a draft resolution which seeks to address a domestic issue in a Member State. The issue in question is the execution of nine Nigerians who were found guilty of murder after due process and in line with the laws of the land and the Constitution of my country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa03">The General Assembly has just celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, and during that celebration it affirmed the commitment of Member States to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. It is now being asked, through immense diplomatic pressure on several Member States of our Organization, to act contrary to the spirit and the letter of Article 2, paragraph 7, of that Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The sovereign right of a Member State to enact its own laws within acceptable international standards is being challenged, and the retention by Member States of capital punishment for serious offences is also being questioned as uncivilized -- as if there were a violation of human rights under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This is an unacceptable irony of events.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa05">The principal sponsors of this draft resolution have not only launched a campaign of disinformation but have also demonstrated an unusual arrogance of power, seeking to prescribe who governs Nigeria, when and how. With all due respect, we submit that the change from one form of government to another is the business of the people of Nigeria. In this connection, my delegation would like to reaffirm that the democratic principle is not alien to Nigeria, and much has been done already by Nigerians themselves about the promotion of that system of governance on a sustainable basis.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa06">It would be unfortunate if the General Assembly -- which under Article 13 of the Charter of the United Nations should make recommendations for promoting international cooperation and for assisting in the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction -- were to agree to take selective actions to deny Nigeria the right to development and to deprive Nigerians of their right to free movement in and out of some Member States of this Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa07">My delegation would like to state that the highly emotive reaction to the rejection of the plea of clemency for the convicted Nigerians cannot justify the manipulation of the procedures of the General Assembly by some relatively more powerful Members of our Organization. By acting on the present draft resolution, the Assembly will be acting contrary to Article 62 of the Charter, which gives the Economic and Social Council the responsibility to</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg010-bk02-pa08">"make recommendations for the purpose of promoting respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa09">What Nigeria needs is international understanding, international accommodation and international cooperation so as to facilitate the faithful implementation of its political programme within its established time frame for a return to civil rule and the promotion of human rights for all in Nigeria. In this connection, we very much welcome any genuine assistance from friendly Member States towards the achievement of this goal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa10">Based on the foregoing observations, my delegation rejects the draft resolution, and in particular its fourth and fifth preambular paragraphs and operative paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6.</div>

In this context, our aim is to promote dialogue, with a view to encouraging our brothers and sisters in Nigeria to find political solutions to their problems. Any action we might undertake should take into account the need to prevent the worsening of the situation in that country. We should encourage the Nigerian forces to continue working for democracy and human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa04">It is within this framework that we welcome the communiqué of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group on the Harare Declaration, issued in London on 20 December 1995. Conscious of the fact that a culture of democracy and of respect for human rights is a process that cannot be imposed from the outside, we believe that time and patience will be needed to fully settle an issue of the magnitude and complexity of that of Nigeria. This is our understanding of the time-frame agreed upon by the Commonwealth Summit in Auckland.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa05">Accordingly, my Government is of the view that we should contribute, to the best of our abilities, to preventing the exacerbation of misunderstandings between Nigeria and the international community at large. Efforts should be deployed in order to ensure that this state of affairs does not reach uncontrollable proportions. We are not convinced that measures in response to human rights violations should be pursued to the last consequence before other possible actions are considered in detail. Instead, we should stand together and devise a common strategy which can assist that sister country in solving its problems and enabling it to return to the family of respected sons and daughters of Africa, whose contribution has been vital in the common struggle for the liberation of our continent.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa06">It is also our understanding that the solution lies on the path of principles and traditions which our continent -- the African continent -- has followed for so many years. This has preserved our sovereignty and reaffirmed our commitment to democracy, respect for human rights and non-interference in internal affairs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa07">For the foregoing reasons, my delegation will abstain on this draft resolution concerning the situation of human rights in Nigeria.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Sudan refers to draft resolution X on human rights in the Sudan. We reaffirm our position of rejection of this unjust draft resolution, which ignores all positive and political developments in Sudan. We have asked for a separate vote on operative paragraphs 2, 4 and 12, regardless of our position on the draft resolution as a whole, because those paragraphs sow the seeds of discord in Sudan with the aim of fragmenting the country and represent blatant interference in the internal affairs of Sudan, in complete contravention of the United Nations Charter, which applies to every Member here today. Moreover, these paragraphs completely ignore the Sudan's continued official and other clarifications concerning the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Sudan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Consequently, we shall vote against that draft resolution and we call upon all countries that uphold the principle of the sovereignty of nations to follow suit.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa01">Our delegation has been deprived of its right to vote in the General Assembly because my country has not paid its contributions in view of the comprehensive sanctions regime imposed against it. This has prevented Iraq from exporting its products and has frozen its assets abroad. Some Powers have rejected Iraq's ongoing attempts to reach a solution exempting it from the application of Article 19 of the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa02">Had we had the right to vote, we would vote against the draft resolutions on the human rights situations in Iraq, Cuba, Nigeria and Sudan. These draft resolutions are of a political character and in no way serve human rights. On the contrary, they do harm to human rights as human rights are used in this context as a ploy to cover up illegal political activities, including interference in the internal affairs of States and imposing outside choices upon them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa03">As to the draft resolution on Iraq, I hope to remind the champions of human rights who shed tears over the situation of human rights in Iraq that it is they who are depriving Iraqi civilians of their basic human rights by imposing a comprehensive sanctions regime that has led to deaths of tens of thousands of women and children. These sanctions have denied Iraqis their basic human rights to food, medication, education and other necessities.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk03-pa01">My delegation would like briefly to explain the reasons that have led it to oppose the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in Nigeria. Given that we have already set forth those reasons in the Third Committee, I will be very brief.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk03-pa02">We would like to emphasize one specific aspect of the issue: our vote is not directed against any State whatsoever but is in strict accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, which in our view has a kind of supremacy over all the other international conventions on human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk03-pa03">As far as basic principles are concerned, the position of the delegation of Burundi is in full conformity with the need to safeguard and respect human rights. However, since we believe that the situation in Nigeria could have been dealt with differently as far as procedure is concerned, we feel that our Government should adhere to the principles for which it stands. It should be understood -- and we would appeal to all our friends who are in favour of this draft resolution and to its sponsors to understand -- that we are not voting against them: we are voting in favour of principles. Just as they are not voting against Burundi, since it is not Burundi but principles that are directly concerned, we earnestly urge them to understand that we should have the right to vote in accordance with our conscience, in accordance with our principles and in accordance with the procedure that we believe to be the right one.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk03-pa04">In conclusion, I repeat that we are hostile to nobody but are adhering to a principle which we regard as sacrosanct: the sovereignty of a Member State. Therefore, respecting the right of the sponsors and of those who will vote in favour of the draft resolution, I repeat those sacred principles already enunciated by a historical political figure, Abraham Lincoln:</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk06-pa04">The text of the resolution, as it stands, can lead to the misinterpretation that the legitimate military action by Croatian security forces, and certain crimes committed by individuals and groups primarily after the military operation, are equivalent to the actions which are also condemned in the text and which are attributed primarily to the Serb side -- such actions as "ethnic cleansing" massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, mass rape and indiscriminate shelling of civilians.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk06-pa05">We wish to reiterate that the Croatian military operation referred to in operative paragraph 6 of the resolution was conducted within the internationally recognized borders of the Republic of Croatia in order to restore the authority of the legitimate and democratically elected Government. Secondly, this operation liberated territory which was under the control of brutal and oppressive foreign proxy forces, which had for the past four years conducted a campaign of genocide against Croats and other non-Serb citizens of Croatia. Thirdly, the military operation lifted the siege of the Bosnian city of Bihac and spared tens of thousands of individuals from meeting the same fate as that of the unfortunate victims of Srebrenica.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk06-pa06">It should be pointed out that the number of civilian casualties, as well as the amount of property destroyed during the course of this military operation, was extremely small for an operation of such a scale. This provides compelling evidence that the Croatian military and Government undertook significant measures to keep collateral damage to a minimum. We wish to stress that Croatia is proud of the professional conduct of its troops during the military operation and their efforts to prevent civilian casualties.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk06-pa07">The Croatian Government is aware that there were criminal acts committed by individuals and groups in the aftermath of the Croatian military operation, resulting in the death of several dozens of individuals -- primarily members of the Serb community in Croatia. The Croatian Government condemns these actions and has undertaken measures to remedy them. We wish to refer, however, to a statement by a United Nations spokesman, Mr. Alun Roberts, in regard to these incidents, as quoted in <i>The New York Times </i>of 12 December 1995, that</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg020-bk06-pa08">"There, has not been an organized Government campaign to harass, loot and kill people".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk06-pa09">In conclusion, Croatia reaffirms its commitment to respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and to remaining transparent in its human rights policy. However, we expect any consideration of Croatia's human rights record to be objective, to reflect the causes of the conflict as well as the complexity of the situation in which Croatia finds itself, and to be guided by sincere concern for human rights and by no other motive. We also wish to stress that if there is need for consideration of Croatia's human rights record, then the proper forum within the United Nations is the Third Committee and not other forums, including the Security Council. Since the situation of human rights in Croatia does not pose a threat to international peace and security, inordinate scrutiny of Croatia's human rights record by the Security Council can only be understood as stemming from politically motivated reasons of certain Council members.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk06-pa10">While my delegation voted in favour of the entire draft resolution, we wish to stress that had operative paragraph 6 been voted on separately we would not have been able to support it.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg021-bk01-pa01">We wish to explain our vote on draft resolution III, "Situation of human rights in Kosovo", which the Assembly has just adopted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg021-bk01-pa02">The Chinese delegation maintains that respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity is a fundamental principle enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Kosovo is a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Since the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a sovereign State, its sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg021-bk01-pa03">In view of those considerations, the Chinese Government could not support the draft resolution on human rights in Kosovo, and my delegation therefore abstained in the voting on draft resolution III.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg021-bk02-pa01">India wishes to explain its vote on draft resolution III, "Situation of human rights in Kosovo".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg021-bk02-pa02">India remains committed to the promotion and protection of all human rights in all States. India is also committed to the preservation and protection of the territorial integrity, national sovereignty and independence of Member States of the United Nations. Further, India firmly adheres to the Charter principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of United Nations Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg021-bk02-pa03">While firmly in favour of promoting and protecting all human rights in all States, we are equally firmly opposed to the increasing tendency to adopt United Nations resolutions on a part of a territory of a Member State, which we believe is a challenge to the territorial integrity of a State and introduces an unwelcome dimension to the debate on human rights. Such resolutions may also be in violation of Article 2, paragraph 7, of the United Nations Charter. They open the way to selectivity and further politicization of the human rights agenda at the United Nations and in international affairs. We are deeply concerned by the growing tendency of some States not only to encourage or support such selectivity, but also to condone the human rights violations of one of the parties to a conflict in resolutions such as the one under discussion. This is not a healthy approach.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg021-bk02-pa04">It was for those reasons that we could not support the draft resolution entitled "Situation of human rights in Kosovo". In our view, the situation in Kosovo should have been addressed in the omnibus draft resolution, under the same agenda item, that dealt with the situation of human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the former Republic of Yugoslavia.</div>
