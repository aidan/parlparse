<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Knight</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">Allow me at the outset to express my congratulations to you, Sir, on your leadership of the Security Council during the month of February. Your diplomatic skills and gracious style have obviously ensured the smooth and effective handling of the various matters which have come before the Council. I had the pleasure of visiting your great country just over a week ago, and I was impressed by its progress and its economic development, as well as by its strong support for multilateralism and the international system. I wish to thank you and the Council for acting promptly on my request to convene this meeting, and I am pleased to see the Secretary-General, who I know has a keen interest in this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">My delegation has come before the Security Council, on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), to call the urgent attention of the international community to the rapidly deteriorating situation in Haiti. The situation has now reached crisis proportions, given the continuing breakdown in law and order, the rising insurgency and the conditions of sheer anarchy and chaos, as well as a worsening humanitarian crisis, which in turn has caused displacement of the population, resulting in increasing numbers of refugees pouring out of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">As the members of the Council are aware, during the past weeks the political upheaval in Haiti has escalated, with heavily armed groups using force to extend control over parts of the country. They have already managed to seize every city in the northern part of the country and it is now our understanding that they will seek to advance even further, with the intention of marching on the capital, Port-au-Prince. The already weakened and outnumbered Haitian National Police have been forced to abandon their posts or protectively barricade themselves against the mounting attacks of the rebel groups. In the latest flare-up of violence, some 70 persons have so far been killed. The prevailing situation within Haiti can no longer be viewed as an internal matter. The current situation now poses a serious threat to regional peace and security, given the outflow of refugees, which threatens to overwhelm the resources of States in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">The past 20 months have been particularly challenging, without much progress towards ending polarization or building a political consensus. The result is that the country is now locked in a political stalemate as a result of the steadfast refusal of the opposition to engage in the process of dialogue mandated by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) action plan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">Given Haiti's status as its newest member, CARICOM has been concerned with the developments in that country and has sought to provide its good offices on numerous occasions to bring a lasting resolution to the crisis. We have maintained that adherence to the following principles is critical: first, the full application of democracy in Haiti; secondly, non-acceptance of a coup d'état in any form; and thirdly, that any change in Haiti must be in accordance with the Haiti's constitution.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">The situation in Haiti is a serious regional concern. It is important to note that, in keeping with Chapter VIII of the Charter, regional organizations are often the first recourse in addressing threats to peace and security. Following the coup d'état against President Aristide in 1991, CARICOM, as the directly relevant sub-regional organization, participated fully in the ongoing efforts of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations to restore peace and stability in Haiti, including through the provision of civilian and military assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">The most recent CARICOM efforts, initiated in early January this year, have included fact-finding missions to Haiti and meetings with the President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and with the opposition. CARICOM's initiative outlining proposals for moving the process forward was presented at a meeting held with the major political stakeholders in Nassau, the Bahamas, from 20 to 21 January. The opposition undertook to discuss the document internally. At CARICOM's invitation, observers from the United States, Canada and the OAS participated in the Nassau meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">On 31 January, Prime Minister Patterson of Jamaica, in his capacity as chairman of CARICOM, hosted a meeting with President Aristide in Kingston. We were again joined by our international partners, including, this time, the European Union. This meeting produced the CARICOM Prior Action Plan, which President Aristide accepted. It involved certain measures to improve the security climate and to generally build confidence. These included compliance with previous OAS resolutions, negotiation of rules for demonstrations, the release of detainees, disarmament of strong-arm groups, the strengthening of the police force and the enjoyment of fundamental freedoms. The Plan also envisaged the establishment of an electoral commission, the formation of a council of eminent persons and the appointment of a neutral and independent prime minister. It further called for the formation of a new Government through a process of consultations between the Prime Minister, the President and the council. Emanating from a subsequent meeting in Washington, with the participation of the United States Secretary of State, the Foreign Minister of Canada, the Secretary-General of the OAS and the permanent observer of France to the OAS, a plan of action was drawn up to facilitate the implementation of the CARICOM Prior Action Plan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">The plan was accepted by President Aristide but has been rejected by the opposition. Members of the Council will well appreciate that it is impossible to make meaningful progress unless both sides are willing to do their part. The fact is that there are some steps that the President cannot take alone, as they require participation by the opposition and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">The situation we now face is completely different from that which began as a political impasse over the exercise of rights and the role of opposition groups. The more recent incursions by heavily armed rebel forces from the north have resulted in reprisal killings, the destruction of property and general lawlessness, creating a state of anarchy in much of the country. As Prime Minister Patterson indicated in a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan last week, immediate action is needed to safeguard democracy and to avert bloodshed and a humanitarian disaster.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa11">In response to the rapidly deteriorating political situation in Haiti, the Government of President Aristide has requested the international community to assist in the restoration of security, order and the rule of law within his country. Specifically, and given the likelihood of the rebel forces reaching the capital, CARICOM has been requested to garner support in the strengthening of the Haitian National Police, with the possibility of their participation in a multinational force in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa12">While CARICOM will continue to play its role in seeking a political solution to the crisis in Haiti, we believe the United Nations has a special responsibility in assisting Haiti, given its record of involvement in previous peacekeeping missions. The restoration of peace and stability should be considered as part of its unfinished business.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa13">In this context, we welcome the appointment by the Secretary-General of a special advisor to coordinate and promote greater United Nations engagement in dealing with the current crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa14">The United Nations past active involvement in Haiti highlights an historical recognition of its responsibility to assist in finding a solution to what has been an intractable situation for too long. The United Nations role has had a significant impact on past attempts that have been deemed relatively successful in stemming the downward spiral and in bringing the parties to the negotiating table. There is no doubt that the volatile situation in Haiti today and the potential for further chaos is not only a threat to the peace and security of the region but also, necessarily, of great concern to the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa15">It is against this background that CARICOM member States seek the direct and immediate intervention of the United Nations in Haiti within the context of the United Nations Charter. The situation is one of utmost urgency and the need for decisive action is paramount.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa16">The immediate need is for the Security Council to authorize the urgent deployment of a multinational force to assist in the restoration of law and order, to facilitate a return to stability and to create an environment in which the continuing efforts to find a solution to the political crisis can be pursued. Such international support would be important in preparing the ground for parliamentary elections and for a presidential election when due. A solution is vital for Haiti's short- and long-term future, which is so seriously endangered by the escalating insurgency and the prospect of a bloody civil war. The Council should authorize the creation of a force to do this and encourage participation by those States with the available resources.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa17">I wish to advise the Council that some members of CARICOM have already indicated a willingness to contribute to such a force within their individual capacities. All members of the international community should do their part. I should stress, Sir, that CARICOM's stand on this issue is not driven by any desire to promote the political interests of any particular personality in the Haitian political arena. It is based on the need to remain faithful to democratic principles and the integrity of a constitutional order.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa18">CARICOM also calls upon the Security Council to endorse urgent action by the international community to address the growing humanitarian crisis and the need to extend assistance, including through the delivery of international aid through the smooth transition to long-term economic and social reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa19">In the light of the growing surge of refugees to neighbouring States, it is also imperative that the States affected be provided with the requisite resources to offset costs for the provision of relief and humanitarian assistance to the refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa20">It is a cruel twist of fate that the first free black republic in this hemisphere has had such a long and difficult history of struggle to protect that very freedom. It is even a more cruel irony that, in this, the bicentenary of the commemoration of the historic event that marked the end of their struggle and the beginning of a new era of freedom, the people of Haiti are today vastly removed from the goals they valiantly fought to achieve -- political freedom, economic prosperity and social stability.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa21">Let us collectively determine again to come to the support of the valiant though long-suffering people of Haiti in their hour of need and to meet their urgent requirements at this critical time. The people of Haiti need help. We are here seeking that help.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I thank His Excellency, Foreign Minister Knight for his statement and for his kind words addressed to the country I represent.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">I now give the floor to the representative of Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Alexandre</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">At the outset, let me express my appreciation to the Security Council, and to you, personally, for the impeccable way in which you are conducting your work as the head of this important body. Let me also commend the Secretary-General for the special interest he is giving and has been giving for some time to the situation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">On behalf of the Government of Haiti, we would like to express our appreciation to the Security Council for the opportunity to make a presentation to the august membership gathered here on the situation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">The situation in Haiti is urgent and serious. Now, more than ever, it requires all the attention of the international community. Since 5 February 2004, the country has been engulfed by an armed insurrection which has already caused more than 60 deaths and hundreds of wounded. These actions have been committed by armed groups made up of former members of a repressive paramilitary force, designated as the Front for the Advancement of Progress in Haiti (FRAPH) and which committed atrocities against the Haitian people during the coup d'état of 1991, as well as former members of the armed forces that were dissolved in 1995, and convicts who have escaped from prison.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The insurgents currently control the northern part of the country, where police stations, radio stations and public buildings have been plundered and burned. They have benefited from this to carry out summary executions of persons identified as loyal to the Government. They have also released prisoners who have already been tried and convicted, among other things, for violent crimes and illegal drug trafficking. They have also plundered storage sites and the residences of peaceful people. An example to be noted is the plundering, in Cap Haïtien, of the World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse, which had more than 800 tons of food.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">The attacks of the armed groups jeopardize the stability of the country's institutions, and particularly, the survival of the population. Beyond the loss of human lives already mentioned, roads and ports have been cut off. It is therefore becoming impossible to supply the northern portion of the country with fuel, food and medicine, which is leading to a chaotic situation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">The latest report of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), of 25 February 2004 <i>(OCHA/GVA-2004/0029)</i>, is more than alarming. This dangerous path of armed violence, against the backdrop of poverty, is not an option. It is a serious threat to the region. Disorder and violence stemming from these armed attacks, threaten to plunge the country into an unprecedented humanitarian disaster and destroy its fragile institutions. Now is the moment that the international community must step forward.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">To escape the violence and poverty, Haitians are again taking to the sea on makeshift craft, risking their lives. Just yesterday, the United States Coast Guard intercepted on the open seas a number of our countrymen who are fleeing our troubled country. The same kind of situation in 1991 led more than 40,000 refugees to the coast of Florida.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">Politically, it is urgent that a solution providing for an end to the crisis be found immediately in order to restore conditions for normal life, including respect for constitutional law, because brutality is rampant, and the terror of the armed bandits prevails. In this context, President Jean Bertrand Aristide on 21 February 2004 welcomed and consented to the plan providing for a solution to the crisis that was presented by a high level delegation from the international community, led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, and which included representatives of the United States, Canada, France, the European Union, CARICOM and members of the special mission of the Organization of American States in Haiti and of the International Organization of la Francophonie.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">That plan for a political settlement to the crisis, as endorsed by the international community, and which provides, inter alia, for a government of international consensus, while respecting constitutional norms, was, unfortunately, rejected by the political opposition which is challenging the international community. The steadfast refusal of the opposition further worsens the crisis. Haiti risks being plunged into the abyss of a civil war, with all of the consequences that entails. Maintaining public order and avoiding chaos and anarchy are major challenges because the National Police, the only legal force, is no longer capable of ensuring the security of the lives and property of the citizens, given its lack of strength and its limited means.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa10">The Government reiterates its call to the opposition to contribute to restoring peace and dialogue in order to find a negotiated political settlement. It reaffirms its faith in the democratic future of Haiti and it will do everything necessary to consolidate and strengthen the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa11">Faced with the intransigence of our brothers and sisters of the opposition, how many women, elderly and children will fall to gunfire and the blows of machetes before we are aided by a force that is capable of helping to restore and maintain a stable environment?</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa12">Given the inflexibility of the main players in the opposition, who continue to believe that the solution must entail overthrowing the head of a constitutional State that has been democratically elected, how many wounded or dead will be found in Haiti before the international community comes to our assistance to avoid a bloodbath or massive exodus of refugees? Must we see an eventual battle in Port-au-Prince before action is taken? Sir, it is better to prevent, than to treat.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa13">The Haitian Government fully associates itself with the position of CARICOM, which requests that the Security Council be seized of the issue in Haiti, and that it do its utmost to send urgently an international force to help restore peace, while conforming to the provisions of the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa14">The Government of Haiti wants the Security Council to reiterate its condemnation of the acts of violence, signify its refusal to accept any form of Government resulting from an anti-democratic and anti-constitutional process, and demand that the opposition accept a political compromise to resolve the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa15">At this time of deep crisis, the issue of human rights deserves to be specifically addressed. The Government welcomes, with satisfaction, the appointment of a special adviser to the Secretary-General and welcomes the initiative to establish, in the country, an office of the Commission on Human Rights. It also anticipates international technical cooperation to professionalize the police, strengthen democratic institutions -- in particular judicial institutions -- to disarm armed groups and to provide security for elections.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa16">After 32 coups d'état in Haiti, it is clear that a democratically elected president must hand over power to another democratically elected president, as is done in all democracies. It is time that the Haitian political class understood that it can accede to power only through elections and without the resort to threats or the use of force. The Government of Haiti is counting on the international community, in particular the countries of the region, to promote a lasting and democratic solution.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to The Honourable Frederick Mitchell, MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Public Service of the Bahamas.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mitchell</span> <span class="nation">Bahamas</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">I wish to thank you, Mr. President, and the representatives of the nations of the Security Council for agreeing to this meeting and to air this subject, which is of such major importance to our country, the region and this hemisphere.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The Bahamas identifies fully with the statement that has been delivered on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) by the Foreign Minister of Jamaica, The Honourable K. D. Knight. We support the CARICOM statement in its entirety. Haiti is a pressing issue. As I said elsewhere, the Bahamas believes that this is not just about a legal obligation; the situation in Haiti presents a moral call to action.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">It is clear that the situation in Haiti is out of control. Law and order has broken down. Haiti is the newest member of CARICOM. It is difficult for us in the region to sit by idly, saying that we support legal constitutional authority, and yet, when the call for help comes from a member State to support that legitimate authority, we seek to rely on legalisms which amount to inaction. That cannot be logically correct. It would seem to set a precedent that because we may consider one politician better suited than another, we dispense with our commitment to democracy. In that case, democracy and the values which follow from it become a matter of convenience which turns entirely on parochial concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">There are two aspects of this present situation. There is the immediate problem of the breakdown in law and order in Haiti. The Haitian Government has represented that is unable with its existing resources to bring the matter under control. There is also the anecdotal evidence of an insurgency that claims to control half the country. The fact is that a nation with 8 million people, no military and a police force of just over 4,000 meant that the governmental authority was thin on the ground in any event. It was therefore not difficult to dislodge a few policemen by coming along with superior weapons and the will to murder and pillage. There can therefore be no pride taken in the scenes of carnage and disorder that have flowed from the guns of the rebel factions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Whatever the motives, if the international community refuses to act and to act quickly, we will be condoning a creeping attempt to overthrow the Government of Haiti by force. In that respect, there are 32 previous examples of the dislodging of heads of State in Haiti by this means. The question the international community must ask is whether it is going to contribute to the repetition of that history or assist in breaking that cycle.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">It would seem that logic dictates a clear choice to help stop the cycle of dislodging heads of State by resorting to extra-constitutional violence. So, the immediate problem to be addressed is helping to restore law and order in Haiti, not next week or next month but today.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">That answer is, of course, deceptively simple. The fact is that in order to restore law and order, someone will be required to do it. That means nations, that means people. That means putting other nations' troops or policemen in harm's way. It may also mean supplying equipment to an undermanned and under-equipped police force. No nation wants to put its people in harm's way, into a situation that is a political quagmire. The Bahamas understands that argument.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">There is a need for a commonality of understanding among all parties in Haiti if the country is to progress out of the present difficulties. The latest CARICOM initiative offers that chance, and we believe that it is imperative for all actors to agree to that plan as the way forward. The international community also allows for the fact that as the plan is executed, there may have to be changes to it to meet existing realities. But let us agree to a plan and stop the violence today.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">Let us be clear: we do not support any side in Haiti. The sovereign choices of the Haitian people as to who their leader is or will be is entirely a decision for the Haitian people. We do not think that our country ought to pollute the debate by venturing a public opinion on that matter. What we do know is that all countries in the hemisphere have acknowledged who presently stands as the legitimate authority in Haiti. When that legitimate authority calls for assistance, it appears to us that it must logically follow that those who can help to restore law and order ought to do so and do so now.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa10">Following on from the short-term effort to restore law and order, there is a need for a long-term effort for keeping the peace in Haiti. In many respects, the world community took its eye off the situation in Haiti in the 1990s, much too anxious to declare victory and walk away. The result is that we are back where we started. This time we ought to recognize and accept that the long-term commitment in the Council must be to affect and promote change in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa11">There is no doubt about our obligations in this matter. We have had an opportunity to speak with all our partners on this issue. We have supported a resolution in the Organization of American States which calls for the provision of a legal mandate for action to assist Haiti. We urge quick and decisive United Nations action so that countries that can help, including our own, can move with legal authority to provide the immediate assistance for security and then contribute to the longer peacekeeping and humanitarian effort.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa12">Haiti and the Haitian people have a right to exist in peaceful and quiet enjoyment of their country within secure borders. The Bahamas comes today to ask for help for the Haitian people. As we have said, that is not only a legal obligation but a moral imperative.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Menéndez</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">We thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting of the Security Council. My delegation welcomes the presence of the Ministers of the Bahamas and Jamaica.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">First, Spain expresses its profound concern at the grave situation affecting Haiti at this moment. Unfortunately, the crisis has only deteriorated since the Council issued a statement on 18 February <i>(press release SC/8004)</i>, urging both the Government and the opposition to reach an agreement and expressed its unanimous support for the initiative of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Organization of American States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">At this afternoon's meeting, we must ask ourselves what the Security Council can do, faced with this grave situation, which we believe is the result of the combination of two crises: a political crisis that has persisted since 2001 and a security crisis generated by the weakness of the State and triggered by armed paramilitary forces.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">In that connection, with respect to what the Security Council can do, we have the following comments.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">First, Spain considers essential the mediation efforts of CARICOM, whose plan of action holds the key to a possible solution. The unfolding of events in recent days, the grave risk of bloodshed, as well as the catastrophic humanitarian situation and the violations of human rights, require urgent measures to be taken in order to find a peaceful solution to the crisis that respects the existing constitutional framework.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">Secondly, we support the dispatch of a civilian peacekeeping force in accordance with the principles of the Charter, which would guarantee security both for humanitarian missions and for OAS and CARICOM mediation missions. It would make it possible to arrive at a political solution to the crisis and at a peaceful outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">Thirdly, we consider that a United-Nations-coordinated humanitarian assistance programme is urgently needed.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">So that all of this can take place, Spain would support the adoption of a Security Council resolution setting out such measures making it possible to resolve the present situation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Finally, in the longer term, a more ambitious strategy must be formulated to seek to overcome the structural problems that give rise to the recurring political crises and outbreaks of violence in Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">Let me begin by thanking the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica and of the Bahamas for their statements. They shed sobering light on the tragic situation in Haiti, which is growing in scope and gravity with every passing hour. Indeed, in recent days the situation in Haiti has sharply worsened, with half of the country under the control of rebel forces. There is now a genuine risk that those forces could soon launch an assault on the capital and that a blood bath could occur.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">Anarchy and violence now prevail in northern Haiti, down to Port-au-Prince, with looting and a lack of security. The situation is of particular concern because it is accompanied by a real humanitarian disaster: there is a sore lack of all necessities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">If the international community does not take decisive action, the whole country could well be plunged into chaos, with all that that implies in terms of the collapse of State institutions, instability, lack of security, human tragedy, flows of refugees and the risk of destabilization in other countries of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">The crisis that has engulfed Haiti for several weeks is clearly political in nature. It could have been -- and still could be -- resolved through negotiation and responsible dialogue among the parties concerned. At a time when the confrontation between the President of the Republic and the opposition has turned into violent conflict, diplomatic efforts towards a political, constitutional settlement must continue and be intensified, because there is no alternative to a negotiated resolution of the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">For that reason, Algeria -- which has been following developments in Haiti with great concern and which firmly condemns the violence in that country -- has joined the rest of the international community in supporting the efforts of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Organization of American States (OAS) aimed at restoring confidence and promoting dialogue among the parties in accordance with the three critical principles just outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">Only yesterday, a determined, unanimous Security Council called on the Government of President Aristide and the political opposition in Haiti to accept the CARICOM-OAS plan of action in order to bring about a peaceful, constitutional resolution of the crisis. But, while President Aristide has accepted the Plan of Action, the opposition continues to reject it, and armed groups strengthen their hold over northern Haiti and prepare to take the capital by force.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">In the face of this deteriorating situation, the Security Council -- while continuing to support the efforts of CARICOM and the OAS and urging the parties to favour dialogue over confrontation -- must urgently consider a variety of options for an international commitment in Haiti, including an international force in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The Council cannot permit Haiti to be engulfed in chaos or its civilian population to be caught up in a spiral of violence. It cannot allow the repetition of a tragedy like those the international community has powerlessly viewed in the past both in Haiti and elsewhere.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">Given the humanitarian disaster looming in Haiti, the Organization must also mobilize the assistance that the Haitian people desperately need in these dire circumstances, and it must strengthen its presence in Haiti. Here, we welcome the Secretary-General's appointment of a Special Adviser for Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">Let me in conclusion pay tribute to CARICOM and the OAS for their tireless efforts to find a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Haiti.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">We welcome the presence of the Secretary-General at this meeting of the Security Council and the participation of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica and the Bahamas.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Moscow shares the international community's deep concern about the wave of violence and human rights abuses that has engulfed Haiti along with the seizure of a number of cities, armed conflict and widespread turmoil, resulting in great loss of human life.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">We firmly condemn the acts of violence in Haiti. In the alarming situation that is developing, we call on all forces in Haitian society to put an end to violence and to undertake peaceful dialogue in order to overcome existing differences and problems by political means, on a democratic, constitutional basis.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">We support the efforts of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and those of other interested States, aimed at providing Haitians with the help they need to normalize the situation. We are prepared to give constructive consideration to proposals about what else the United Nations might do in that sphere.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">We are gravely concerned about the fact that the latest developments reveal the deterioration of an already difficult humanitarian situation in Haiti, with the people being provided only intermittently with food, drinking water, fuel and medicine. We view as unacceptable the actions of those who impede the work of international humanitarian organizations in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">Against that backdrop, we greatly appreciate the endeavours of the staff of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other specialized agencies of the United Nations system. In the present difficult conditions, they continue their efforts to ensure delivery of the food and other humanitarian assistance that is needed in Haiti. We call on all parties concerned to cooperate actively with them to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and of United Nations facilities.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">Clearly, Haiti also has a great need for ongoing comprehensive economic, financial and technical assistance from the international community so that it can get back on its feet and overcome the protracted social and economic crisis that has engulfed it. As in many other developing nations, stabilization in Haiti ultimately depends on remedying the extremely difficult social and economic situation that, in the end, is the source of all its other ills.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Thomson</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">We welcome this opportunity to discuss the deeply troubling situation in Haiti with the representative of Haiti and with important regional actors, and with the participation of the Secretary-General. We recognize and understand the regional concerns about the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The United Kingdom fully supports the statement that will be made by the Irish presidency on behalf of the European Union shortly, so I will confine myself to just one or two points.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">The United Kingdom believes a resolution to the current political crisis can still be obtained by peaceful means through negotiation. In this context, we fully support the plan of action put forward by the Caribbean Community and the Organization of American States. It is an important basis for a solution to the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">We urgently call on all parties in Haiti to exercise restraint, to contribute to the restoration of law and order, to make the well-being of the civilian population their priority, to observe human rights scrupulously and to respect the international humanitarian personnel and facilities in Haiti. We urge the Government and opposition to re-enter negotiations in the interests of the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">The United Kingdom continues to support the efforts of those working to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. We acknowledge the call for international involvement in Haiti, and we are ready to consider carefully and quickly proposals for the international community to contribute to the stabilization of the situation and to its durable, long-term improvement.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Maquieira</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">First, I would like to welcome the presence of the Secretary-General at this important discussion of a country in our region. I would also like to thank the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica and the Bahamas -- The Honourable Keith Knight and Mr. Frederick Mitchell -- for their eloquent statements. I also wish to thank the Permanent Representative of Haiti for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">Chile regrets that once again the political situation in Haiti has reached a crisis and that that has obliged the Security Council to take up the issue once again. At the same time, we believe that this is a timely debate, enabling us to listen carefully to various countries who, together with the Council, have shown their concern about the situation, so that we can then discuss and devise a way to deal with the political and constitutional crisis in Haiti, which needs a peaceful solution to the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">We view the violent events with concern. We believe in particular that the efforts of the international community should be focused on finding a political solution to the crisis. Its principal objective should be to support an agreement that would facilitate the restoration of peace, democracy and full respect for human rights in Haiti. To that end, my country's position comprises five points.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">First, as we indicate in the draft presidential statement that we will adopt today, we favour a political solution by constitutional and peaceful means, which can be achieved on the basis of the plan of action of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Organization of American States (OAS) and variants that may emerge in the negotiating process.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">Secondly, we consider that that process should be conducted by regional and subregional organs that currently are acting, although the Security Council should not discard a more robust action should it become necessary, as has occurred in the past. That was endorsed by the resolution adopted today by the Permanent Council of the OAS, which urges that the Security Council take necessary and urgent measures under the United Nations Charter and calls upon the Secretary-General of the OAS to maintain close contact with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, with a view to ensuring coordination and complementarity in the roles that both organizations are to play.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">Thirdly, we support the appointment of a special adviser of the Secretary-General for Haiti. We consider that very important, particularly with regard to supporting the coordination of United Nations activities, as well as those undertaken by other regional organizations, both in the political area and with regard to humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">Fourthly, we consider that any formula that is used in the consideration of dispatching a police or civilian force should be used to support the political agreement, once it is attained.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">Finally, we wish to say that any solution to the political and constitutional problems in Haiti in the short term must, as an urgent matter, anticipate a plan for humanitarian assistance and, in the medium and long term, a plan for economic and social development, with the view to giving resolute support to the political process and thereby to avoiding such painful and unfortunate crises as this one, which has serious effects on the people of Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baja</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">We wish to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting on the question concerning Haiti, with the added impact of the presence of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Yesterday we had a briefing from the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs about the grim situation on the ground in Haiti. This afternoon, the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and Bahamas and the Permanent Representative of Haiti had an even more grim and bleak picture of the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The urgent priority now is to restore order on the ground, avoid further loss of life and property, pre-empt further human rights abuses and allow safe delivery of humanitarian assistance. That has been strongly advocated by the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and Bahamas. There is no military force in Haiti, and the civilian police are incapable of doing all that. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an international civilian police presence to do the job. We are aware that there are calls from powerful nations and large organizations -- also from nations not so powerful, and organizations not so large -- for rebels to cease and desist from further violence. But such calls, no matter in how strong a voice, must be accompanied by strong action on the ground. Otherwise, they may remain hollow and empty and go unheeded.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">We are also aware that there are ongoing diplomatic and political initiatives to secure a peaceful solution to the crisis. But those laudable initiatives will have a greater chance of success only when the guns are silent. By their pronouncements both sides have hardened their positions and are on a collision course. Given the volatility of the situation in Haiti, if an international force in support of a political settlement is envisaged, it must be done now, before the situation further deteriorates, before a blood bath occurs.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">Time is of the essence, and we must bite the bullet now. We therefore see merit in the statement of the Foreign Minister of France, circulated as a Security Council document, which calls for, inter alia, the immediate establishment of a civilian peacekeeping force under a mandate mentioned therein. A number of countries have said that they may be ready to contribute to that force. There are also a number of countries that have sent troops to Haiti to protect their citizens. We could thus readily have a new coalition of the willing to arrest continued violence and the breakdown of law and order in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Although the circumstances are different, INTERFET -- the international force in East Timor -- which was authorized by the Security Council, was instrumental in arresting violence and restoring law and order in that country. Australia and other countries in the region restored law and order in the Solomon Islands last year.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">Of course, a peaceful and constitutional solution to the current crisis in Haiti will have to be evolved.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">We are gratified to note that the Organization of American States (OAS), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and other countries with particular interest are engaged in Haiti to persuade Haitians to resolve their differences peacefully, democratically and constitutionally. That will obviate the spectre of refugees: boat people from Haiti spilling into the neighbouring countries. South-East Asia had that sad experience during the Viet Nam war.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">Yesterday, the Council President, on behalf of the Council, issued a press statement (press release<a href="../pdf/SC/8009.pdf" class="nolink">press release SC/8009)</a> that called upon the Government and the armed rebels to cease the use of violence to advance political goals. It remains unclear whether that message ever really reached the parties concerned, or whether they heard even a bit of what we were saying. If, after this meeting, the Council decides to renew yesterday's call, it must also decide to do something beyond that call and address the situation on the ground. Otherwise, we may find ourselves addressing our own statement and, as an unintended consequence, only embarrass ourselves.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">The international community and the United Nations system should not abrogate its responsibility to treat the current structural dysfunction in Haiti now to a robust presence in order to address security and humanitarian aspects. The surest way to allow a bad situation to worsen and to spread is to do nothing or to do something too late. I believe the Security Council should avoid that. We therefore welcome the appointment by the Secretary-General of the Special Adviser on Haiti for that purpose.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gaspar Martins</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I would like first to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. We are grateful that the Secretary-General has returned so that he can be with us this afternoon. This is a unique opportunity for us to consider this matter with the full participation of the key regional partners. On behalf of Angola, I commend the Secretary-General for the way in which he has seized this challenge and has come to the Council so that we may jointly consider this crisis, which is not only a Caribbean crisis, but international: it is our crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">The current crisis in Haiti calls once again for the Security Council and the rest of the international community to take a stand by doing what is our responsibility: to restore peace and the rule of law in that crisis-ridden country. Our debate this afternoon in itself attests to the resolve of the international community and of the Council to act. The armed insurgency, if allowed to proceed unchecked, would not represent a dignified or effective alternative. The outcome would be yet another outlaw regime, which would open yet another chapter in the era of darkness and obscurantism for the people of Haiti -- an era that has already lasted too long.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">In my delegation's view, those are strong enough reasons for the deep concerns expressed by the international community with regard to events in Haiti and for our willingness to act. We fully support the initiative of CARICOM and of the OAS, presented so eloquently as a political solution to the crisis, and we appeal to the opposition to reconsider its rejection of the Plan that has been submitted. We believe the democratic opposition should seize this opportunity as a realistic way to advance its objectives for the democratization of Haiti and for the attainment of its political goals.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">We would like to express our appreciation for the responses made by the Governments of France, Canada and the United States. I believe their continued engagement will help the people of Haiti and the other countries of the region to find appropriate solutions to the crisis. My delegation is prepared to support the actions of the Security Council aimed at an effective engagement in Haiti, including that of an international force to support a political settlement. My delegation also fully supports the appointment by the Secretary-General of a Special Adviser on Haiti, as the situation is evolving in such a way that it warrants a more effective United Nations presence.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">The humanitarian crisis unfolding in Haiti is a cause of great concern. We call on the parties to ensure the protection of civilians, the safety of humanitarian personnel and respect for human rights. In that connection, we support the launching of the flash appeal for humanitarian assistance to the people of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">In conclusion, I support yesterday's response by the President of the Security Council in the form of a press statement<a href="../pdf/SC/8009.pdf" class="nolink">press statement SC/8009</a>. I hope that the Council will issue a presidential statement this afternoon, which should be clear and unambiguous in order to deal with the situation, which is evolving in a very dangerous way. The testimony presented this afternoon by the countries of the region should be taken very seriously as sound advice.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adechi</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">Thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting, which will enable us to explore the critical situation prevailing in Haiti. I warmly welcome the presence of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica and of the Bahamas.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">We are very much concerned at the gravity of the situation in Haiti, with which Benin has very important historical and blood ties. That situation calls for robust measures to spare the Haitian people the predictable consequences of a tragic confrontation by rival forces. Not long ago, the international community undertook major efforts to re-establish peace and constitutional legality in Haiti. That was a fresh opportunity for the country to enable democracy to take root and to develop prosperity. Perhaps we did not address the problem from the right direction, because Haiti has again fallen into the abyss.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">There is new urgency in Haiti. The security situation is worrisome; the humanitarian situation has completely deteriorated and requires concerted and immediate action. Therefore, we must quickly stabilize the situation in the country to avert the real risk that Haiti will plunge into chaos. We urge all the parties involved in the Haitian crisis to agree to commit themselves to the path of dialogue and negotiation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">We welcome and support the initiatives taken by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Organization of American States (OAS) and the countries involved in the quest for a political and peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis. We believe that the quest for peace and the resumption of dialogue must be carried out in the context of the existing constitutional order. We are also pleased that the Secretary-General has decided to appoint a special advisor to follow the situation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">The international community must support and help the Haitian people to move definitively into a virtuous cycle of growth. The Haitian people deserve genuine prospects for growth, after 200 years of independence, passed over by history and carrying the heavy burden of instability and extreme poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">Our commitment to democracy and economic and social development in Haiti must provide for and facilitate the following actions: in the short-term, facilitate emergency humanitarian assistance; restore law and public order and the respect for basic freedoms; establish the rule of law; create a national republican army; professionalize the police; and strengthen institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">But all of these efforts will be in vain if Haiti's people do not share the values and principles to which we refer today. Therefore, the Haitian authorities and all those who aspire to undertake political responsibilities in that country must fully embrace the clear aspirations of the Haitian people and other peoples of the region to be governed by law and to build free, democratic and prosperous societies.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">We welcome the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas. We would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this timely meeting of the Security Council this afternoon to consider the political impasse, the humanitarian crisis and human rights violations in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">Germany fully aligns herself with the statement to be given later in this debate by Ambassador Ryan of Ireland on behalf of the European Union. I would also like to state that Germany, as acting President of the European Union in Haiti, is actively supporting the joint efforts to reach a political solution to the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">We call for continuous support to the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in brokering a political settlement. The political dialogue must be conducted in a spirit of compromise on all sides. Not confrontation, but reconciliation and confidence-building among the Haitian parties are the objectives of the international efforts to lay the foundations for sustainable democratic development in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">It is the responsibility of all Haitian parties concerned to reject violent means as a tool for achieving political change. Killing and looting, anarchy in the streets and organized human rights violations cannot be the basis for Haiti's future. Rebel groups or militias should not be tolerated as factors in what would be an irresponsible political gamble, since this would only add to the misery of the people of Haiti. Those who calculate that violence might further their cause should be aware that this violence might soon be turned against them. There is no alternative, in our view, to a political settlement that reconciles all parts of the Haitian population within the legal framework of their own constitution.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">Such a settlement requires foreign assistance in its implementation. The Security Council should be ready to assist in the stabilization efforts in all possible ways and in a short period of time.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">In addition to the Haitian parties concerned, the international community also has obligations in light of the fact that law and order have disappeared in large areas of a United Nations Member State. Time is running short, in view of the increasing chaos, violence and misery. We have to discuss ways and means of assisting the Haitian population. Germany therefore welcomes the Secretary-General's decision to appoint a special advisor and looks forward to working with him. We also welcome the initiative of the French Government to invite representatives of both the Government and the opposition to talks in Paris.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">We deplore the loss of life in Haiti and we are facing a worsening humanitarian situation which is, of course, of great concern to us. Children are hindered from attending school, energy shortages close down hospitals and the distribution of food is interrupted. We urge all parties involved in the conflict to grant free access to the delivery of humanitarian assistance, to respect human rights and to observe international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">For the sake of the people of Haiti, violence and confrontation must end immediately, and we expect the Council to make this clear in an unambiguous presidential statement at the end of this debate.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khalid</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">We thank you, Mr. President, for convening this important meeting, and we welcome in our midst the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas, as well as other representatives of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">We have viewed with growing concern in recent weeks the deteriorating political and humanitarian situation in Haiti. The situation has been rightly described as reaching crisis proportions. The need for immediate action in order to save lives and prevent yet another conflict cannot be over-emphasized. We share the concerns of other Council members regarding the humanitarian and human rights situation in Haiti. Immediate action is warranted to alleviate human suffering.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Pakistan commends the efforts made so far by the friends of Haiti to help defuse the crisis. Pakistan also supports the initiative taken by the Organization of American States (OAS) and CARICOM to promote a peaceful political and constitutional solution of the crisis. We still hope that the parties can find a way forward towards a peaceful settlement through these efforts. My delegation is also willing to consider broader international engagement in support of a political solution in accordance with the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">As the Council considers this situation, we offer a few words of caution. We agree that there are no quick fixes and no easy solutions in Haiti. The problems that Haiti faces are multi-dimensional; decades of poverty, economic collapse, environmental degradation, violence and instability have left it the poorest country in the Americas. The solutions to these problems must, therefore, also be found on several fronts.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">The immediate concerns in the political, security and humanitarian areas must be addressed, but so must the other, deeper socio-economic root causes of conflict and instability in Haiti. Although the involvement of the United Nations in Haiti dates back to 1986 and even included a United Nations peacekeeping operation in the mid-nineties, the United Nations withdrew prematurely without addressing many of the root causes. My delegation has repeatedly advised against the premature disengagement of the United Nations in any conflict situation. We have also called for a more comprehensive approach involving not just the Security Council but also the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council to address all the underlying issues in such complex situations. If the United Nations becomes involved once again, it must do so with sufficient political and financial will and with a sustained commitment to stay the course until lasting peace and security in Haiti and the region is fully assured.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Negroponte</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">Thank you, Mr. President, for calling this meeting on the situation in Haiti. We also want to welcome the earlier presence of the Secretary-General as well as the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas, who have come to speak to us this afternoon, and of our colleague the representative of the Government of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">The United States is deeply concerned about the political crisis in Haiti. We condemn the use of violence and call on all political actors to engage in dialogue to achieve a sustainable, constitutional, political solution. Only by securing such a solution can the Haitian people build a better future for themselves -- a future that is democratic, prosperous, respectful of human rights and peaceful. If a sustainable political agreement in Haiti is reached, the United States would support efforts to deploy an international force to support its implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">We have worked closely with the Caribbean Community, the Organization of American States (OAS), the Group of Friends of Haiti and others to respond to the crisis in Haiti, and we will continue to do so.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">We also have strongly supported the full implementation of the Organization of American States resolutions <i>(CP/806)</i>, <i>(CP/822)</i>, and, more recently, <i>(CP/861)</i>. Those resolutions remain valid and outline steps that must be taken if democracy is to take root. We continue to support the OAS special mission in Haiti. The Mission can serve as the foundation for an expanded international presence to professionalize the Haitian National Police, promote the rule of law, disarm gangs and encourage a climate of security conducive to democratic activity.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">We urge all democratic elements in Haiti to maintain active dialogue to reach a lasting political solution. Naturally, our dialogue with them and with other elements of Haitian society must continue.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">It is imperative that such a solution be reached quickly, before a serious humanitarian crisis emerges. The Haitian people have already suffered a great deal in extreme poverty and precarious living conditions. And yet, they face the real prospect of an even greater calamity: deepening crisis, possible humanitarian emergency and an uncertain political future. Facing this crisis and the prospect that it may deepen, the parties must act in the best interests of the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">We have listened carefully to the suggestions and proposals of our partners in the Caribbean Community. We will continue to closely consult with them and other nations regarding the international community's response to Haiti's crisis.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. de La Sablière</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I am grateful to you, Sir, for organizing today's debate. As you know, my country, which is linked to Haiti by historical ties, is particularly concerned by the grave situation in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica, current Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, and thank them both for their statements. We share their sense of urgency and their will to act. We too have been in close contact in recent days with our main partners concerning this crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">We are aware that CARICOM and the Organization of American States (OAS) bring to the issue legitimacy, expertise and a will to act, assets that are essential to finding a solution. I will say at the outset that, in our view, the point of departure for resolving the crisis lies in the Plan of Action put forward by CARICOM and the OAS. The crucial mobilization of the international community must revolve around that Plan of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">What can we do, in this grave hour, for the Haitian people? We are facing a situation that is urgent on two levels. It is urgent, first, with regard to the humanitarian situation of the people, which is worsening in a very troubling manner and in particular with regard to the human rights violations to which people are falling victim. We must support international efforts to respond to that situation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">Secondly, it is urgent in terms of finding a solution to the political crisis, a solution that must lie within the current constitutional framework. We therefore believe it is important to insist on the proposals of the two regional organizations relating to the establishment of a transitional government of national unity, led by a prime minister and designated according to the provisions of the CARICOM Plan of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">To ensure the necessary support for that plan, it would be useful, as the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dominique de Villepin proposed yesterday, to supplement it, inter alia by accelerating the timetable for presidential and general elections.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">It goes without saying that international assistance should be deployed to prepare for such elections through the establishment of an electoral commission, legitimate voter registration roles and the organization of international observer missions. In that context, we, like others, believe that a civilian peacekeeping force should be envisaged. Such a force would not be a United Nations force, but should be authorized by the Security Council and based upon a Council mandate. It could be an important complement to a political solution: established immediately to support a government of national unity, it could help re-establish public order and support the international community's action on the ground, especially in the humanitarian and human rights spheres.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">As my authorities have indicated at the highest level, France would be prepared to contribute to a civilian peacekeeping force meeting those conditions, supplementing the contingents that must necessarily come, first and foremost, from the countries of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">I would add that it is up to the Haitian political forces themselves to make the concessions necessary to achieve a political agreement. I can only join in the calls issued by the Security Council both to the Government authorities and to the opposition.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">We are profoundly disturbed by the violence and the attacks on human rights that are currently taking place in Haiti. We beseech the country's political leaders to make the necessary gestures of openness. We believe that then, the international community, through its support for CARICOM and the OAS, will be able to fulfil its part of the contract in the areas that I mentioned, both in the political arena and on the humanitarian level, in the area of human rights and with respect to the economic and social reconstruction of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa11">The United Nations will have an essential role to play in that regard. We commend the Secretary-General for the decisions he has already taken, and we would support the appointment, when the time comes, of a special representative capable of acting on the ground and, in particular, of ensuring optimal coordination among the agencies and organizations in extending assistance to the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa12">The Council may be assured that France is determined to continue its efforts to contribute to the international community's mobilization for Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I too welcome the presence of the Secretary-General during the first part of our meeting and the participation of Foreign Minister Knight and Foreign Minister Mitchell. I convey through them our sincere appreciation for the steady efforts that the authorities of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member States are making with a view to ensuring a peaceful resolution of the current political crisis in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">As Romania associates itself with the statement to be made shortly by the Permanent Representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union, I would like to make only a few brief comments. First, I reaffirm Romania's support for the regional initiatives aimed at restoring peace in Haiti. We are of the view that the Plan of Action of CARICOM and the Organization of American States (OAS) provides good elements for building confidence and fostering political dialogue among the Haitian parties. Its basic tenets should be pursued, as they bear real potential for bringing about a peaceful and constitutional settlement of the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">The international community cannot afford to ignore the risks entailed by the violent disruption of the constitutional process. In that context, we commend the initiatives taken by the United States, France and Canada alongside the regional actors. We believe that it would be appropriate and wise to refine and complement the Plan of Action already presented to the Haitian Government and the political opposition with other ideas aimed at strengthening global support for a political settlement in accordance with the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">In that manner, it would be possible to consider an accelerated timetable for the political process in Haiti. We continue to believe that an inclusive political agreement is possible and that achieving it should be of the utmost priority. In that regard, we join others in urging all Haitian parties to show the necessary spirit of compromise and in urging the armed rebels to stop the violence and make a political settlement possible.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">Secondly, I wish to emphasize that the sources of instability in Haiti are complex and interrelated: poverty, weak governance, the lack of development and the lack of tangible benefits in the day-to-day life of Haitians. The situation requires a coherent and integrated approach to addressing the core causes of instability and to considering a long-term solution. Instead of putting out the fire every time a crisis arises, we must deal with the causes that generate periodic re-ignition.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">Thirdly, along with other members of the Security Council, Romania takes note of the request for action made by CARICOM and by the representative of the Haitian Government. The Romanian delegation is ready to work closely with other delegations in order to find the necessary answer to this request, in accordance with the United Nations Charter and within the specific competence of the Security Council in the area of maintaining international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">Finally, Romania welcomes the Secretary-General's decision to appoint a Special Adviser for Haiti and believes that one of the Adviser's priority tasks should be to address the humanitarian crisis which threatens to engulf the entire country. We believe that, meanwhile, the Security Council should continue to follow closely the unfolding of events in Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I welcome the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas at this meeting of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">In seeking a political solution for the current serious crisis in Haiti, Brazil is grateful for the efforts being carried out by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Organization of American States (OAS). Our colleague from Chile, Ambassador Maquieira, has already mentioned that earlier this afternoon, the Organization of American States adopted a new resolution on the initiative of the Caribbean countries, Canada, Mexico and Brazil. I would add only that the resolution stresses three points: first, the hope and expectation that the Security Council will take the necessary and appropriate urgent measures; secondly that the measures taken should be those established in the Charter of the United Nations; and thirdly, it stresses the idea of ensuring coordination and complementarity between the roles of the OAS and the United Nations, taking into special account the activities of the OAS special mission in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">We are grateful to you, Mr. President, for convening this public meeting of the Security Council to discuss the current state of affairs in Haiti. This meeting is timely and appropriate. Under your leadership, the Security Council has held regular consultations on this issue and has been kept informed of the events taking place in that country. This meeting now provides an opportunity to listen also to the views of the wider membership of the United Nations on this very worrisome situation. We strongly appreciate the fact that many delegations have requested to speak today.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">Brazil is very concerned by the deterioration of the situation in Haiti in its political, economic, security and humanitarian dimensions. We are closely following the events taking place there through our embassies in the region and within the frameworks of the Organization of American States and the Rio Group. My delegation expresses the solidarity of Brazil with all the people of Haiti in this difficult moment. Like us, most Haitians share the view that violence cannot be an acceptable solution to overcoming differences or advancing ideas and views.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">Within the OAS, we have been actively participating in the discussions and negotiations designed to provide a solution to the political crisis. We also took part in the negotiations on OAS resolution <a href="../pdf/CP-861.pdf" class="nolink">CP/861</a> and others. And in the context of the Group of Friends, we have been in direct contact with all the parties involved in the process. As a country of the region, Brazil attaches the utmost importance to safeguarding democracy and legality in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">In the Rio Group, whose presidency Brazil has held since January, we have been maintaining consultations on this subject. The Group has recently issued two communiqués. The most recent, released yesterday, expressed our endorsement of the efforts of the OAS and CARICOM towards a peaceful solution to the crisis in Haiti as well as of the efforts of the United Nations, especially its activities in the field of humanitarian assistance. We called upon the parties to accept the Plan presented by CARICOM, and we strongly condemned the acts of violence that are taking place in Haiti. On that occasion, we also voiced our support for the democratically elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">Thanks to the continuing efforts of the international mediators -- the OAS, CARICOM, France, the United States and Canada -- there still seems to be room for dialogue, although the situation in the country, mainly after the seizure of Cap-Haïtien, is steadily deteriorating. The Government of Brazil deplores the decision of the opposition sectors to reject both the Plan of Action presented last Saturday and the statement of guarantors. Our delegation calls upon those sectors to reconsider the position they voiced last Tuesday, show a willingness to engage in an effective and constructive dialogue and renounce all violent acts designed to put forward their political agenda. We believe that the elements outlined in the Plan of Action provided a way out of the current political impasse. We call on all the parties to render all possible assistance to efforts towards peace in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">The Brazilian authorities are in contact with their international counterparts and are ready to discuss all possibilities for international engagement designed to promote security and to address the humanitarian situation in Haiti, so long as they are carried out within the framework of the United Nations Charter and in accordance with the basic principles of international law.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">My delegation is concerned about the increasing deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Haiti. Brazil supports all the efforts being carried out by United Nations agencies on the ground, and we strongly deplore the restrictions on movement that are being imposed on those agencies. We call upon all the parties to facilitate humanitarian assistance. Above all, we would like to stress the importance of respecting the safety of international humanitarian personnel and facilities.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">We also emphasize the need for all parties to respect human rights in the country. Perpetrators of violations should bear in mind that, sooner or later, they will be held accountable for their irresponsible acts.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa11">Finally, I would like to stress the importance of a renewed commitment by the international community, and especially by the United Nations, to creating long-term conditions for a stable and prosperous Haiti. The resurgence of large-scale violence in the country, 10 years after the Council was seized of this matter, shows that the means then adopted did not bring about the results envisaged and that innovative approaches are required. It is quite clear that the root causes -- poverty, political instability and institutional weakness -- have yet to be addressed, and that this should begin to be done as soon as the present strife and political instability are overcome.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa12">The delegation of Brazil welcomes the Secretary-General's decision to appoint a Special Adviser on Haiti, and believes that he can do much to contribute not only to resolving the present situation but also to putting forth constructive ideas for dealing with the long-standing problems that afflict Haiti and its valorous people.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa13">As we look to the future, we see the matter of the crisis in Haiti becoming increasingly urgent. Having listened to the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas, to the Permanent Representative of Haiti and to fellow members of the Council, we are convinced that the Security Council will have to urgently consider the deployment of an international force in Haiti within the context of the United Nations Charter. We are willing to engage in detailed discussions on this and on the other emerging proposals on this issue.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of China.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">The Chinese delegation welcomes the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas to our meeting today. Their statements will be very useful in the Council's consideration of this item. We completely understand their anxiety and concern about the crisis in Haiti. Their recommendations merit the Council's serious consideration and study.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">China is following closely the development of the situation in Haiti and is gravely concerned at the heavy casualties caused by the continued deterioration of that situation. We urge all sides in Haiti to resolve the crisis by peaceful means, through dialogue, in the best interests of their people and their nation. All sides should redouble their efforts to that end so as to prevent further bloodshed and conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">We commend the Organization of American States, the Caribbean Community and others for their tireless efforts to press all Haitian parties forward to break the current deadlock, and we support their continuing to play an active role. We welcome the Secretary-General's decision to appoint a Special Adviser on Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">We call on the international community to provide the people of Haiti with emergency humanitarian assistance. China will participate in the international community's efforts to help ease the current situation in Haiti and to attain lasting peace, stability and development in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">The next speaker is the representative of Ireland, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ryan</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding countries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, the candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, and the European Free Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area Iceland and Liechtenstein align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">The European Union welcomes this initiative by the Security Council to address the situation in Haiti at this critical time. The European Union also welcomes the decision by the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Adviser on Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">The European Union is gravely concerned at the worsening situation in Haiti. Our concern has increased with each troubling report on the marked deterioration in the security situation, the continuing loss of life, the abuse of human rights, the serious violations of democratic rules, the reduction in access for humanitarian workers and the hindering of the provision of assistance to the affected civilian population.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">The European Union reminds all concerned of their duty to respect the Haitian Constitution and to adhere to international law, including international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law. We call on all parties to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid and to respect humanitarian personnel, establishments, vehicles and medical facilities.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">The present crisis in Haiti must be resolved peacefully, through constitutional means and a process of political dialogue and compromise. The European Union has given clear support to the efforts of the Organization of American States (OAS) to facilitate a resolution of the political impasse in Haiti. We have also strongly supported the recent initiative by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The European Union deeply regrets that the opposition in Haiti has so far declined to accept the Plan of Action presented to the Government and the opposition in Haiti on Saturday, 21 February. The European Union remains convinced that the principles of that plan offer an important opportunity to restore confidence and to facilitate dialogue. All parties bear heavy responsibilities in the current circumstances and need to act accordingly.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">The European Union stands ready, together with other concerned States and regional organizations, to accelerate the search for a peaceful, democratic and constitutional outcome. In that regard, the European Union particularly welcomes the urgent initiative of the Government of France to invite representatives of the Haitian Government, the opposition and civil society to talks in Paris tomorrow. While we await the outcome of those discussions, the European Union calls on all parties to refrain from any action which would further imperil the welfare of the Haitian people.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Cuba, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Requeijo Gual</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">Cuba is following events in Haiti closely and with great concern. Haiti is a brother Caribbean nation with which we have close historic ties. It is the duty of us all to stand by the side of Haiti. Let us not forget that it was in Haiti, some 200 years ago, that the peoples of the Caribbean and Latin American began their struggle for freedom. The international community must help Haiti at this crucial time in its history. To the old problems, with their roots in colonialism and exploitation, new, burning troubles have been added, related to the unjust and exclusionary international economic order.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">Cuba will continue to adhere strictly to its principled position of non-interference in the internal affairs of any country, including Haiti. We support the efforts of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) towards a just and peaceful resolution of the current situation in Haiti. We firmly condemn all the acts of violence taking place in that country and deplore the ongoing casualties and material damage. The Cuban assistance personnel currently in Haiti will continue to abide strictly by the principle of non-interference in that country's internal affairs. The security of those personnel must be fully guaranteed. Likewise, the integrity of the Cuban Embassy and of all its personnel remaining in Port-au-Prince must be fully respected.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">Despite the critical situation in Haiti, Cuban volunteers continue to work at their posts. Cuban doctors, in particular, continue to provide their services to the Haitian people, who now need them so much. Cuba currently has a medical brigade in Haiti composed of 525 volunteers, of whom 332 are doctors. They are scattered throughout the country's departments and serve 75 per cent of the 8.3 million Haitians. To have an idea of the importance of their work, one must know that Haiti has fewer than 2,000 doctors, 90 per cent of whom provide their services in the country's capital.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">In the past five years, Cuban doctors in Haiti have conducted nearly 5 million medical appointments, assisted in almost 45,000 births and performed 59,000 surgical interventions. It is estimated that nearly 86,000 human lives have been saved by Cuban health workers in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">Cuba has also provided assistance to the country with regard to promoting literacy, training Haitian doctors, sanitation, aquaculture, food security, culture, road construction and the functioning of Darbonne's main sugar refinery.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">In the light of the current domestic tensions in this brotherly country, which have resulted in the departure of a number of foreign residents, our Government on 10 February explicitly instructed our Embassy staff in Port-au-Prince to remain in place, working uninterrupted with all the members of the Cuban medical brigade throughout the country.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">In addition, given the obstacles that may arise with regard to the availability of medicines, Cuba sent a 12.2-ton shipment of 525 units of nearly 80 medicines on 11 February to enable each Cuban medical volunteer to successfully perform his or her work. Cuban medical personnel, who are abiding strictly by the principle of non-interference in Haiti's internal affairs, are honourably carrying out their noble mission of tending to the health of the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">If all of what I have described is proof of what even a small and blockaded country can do for Haiti, then other States that have ample economic and financial resources can do much more in terms of providing cooperation and official development assistance to that brotherly Caribbean country. In particular, the Cuban people feel they are fulfilling their duty and honouring a debt of gratitude to the peoples of the Caribbean, who have been so steadfast in their unwavering friendship and solidarity with Cuba.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa09">Once again, we reaffirm Cuba's firm intention to continue to help in every possible way to achieve a peaceful, just and lasting solution to the situation in Haiti. We hope that, given the grave situation facing that brotherly country, the United Nations and the international community as a whole will rise to the level required by events.</p>

The Organization of American States (OAS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have taken the lead in responding in recent weeks, and Canada has fully endorsed their efforts. But now the time has come for the Council to once again become seized with the situation in Haiti, as the OAS Permanent Council asked in its resolution adopted this morning.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa01">Ten years ago, this body was called upon to decide how to respond to similar troubles in Haiti. The action by the international community then was decisive and successful, but only in the short term. Haiti is again in the process of sliding into anarchy, its population in a state of great vulnerability. Civilians are being attacked with impunity, and humanitarian workers are increasingly unable to help them.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk06-pa01">We can be under no illusions. The international community cannot solve Haiti's problems. It is Haitians themselves who must determine the way forward, finding a new way to work together for their own future. That is why Canada was so deeply distressed by the decision of the Haitian opposition to reject the CARICOM Plan. We believe the Plan is still the best option for a peaceful resolution of the current situation. No winners will emerge from the path of violence on which Haiti is embarking. It will take generations for people to heal from the grief and anger that that violence will leave in its wake.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk06-pa02">There is a heavy responsibility on President Aristide and on the opposition parties to reject violence, to make compromises and to embrace democratic and peaceful solutions. We urge them to implement the provisions of the CARICOM Plan. As the Plan itself makes clear, any transition in Haitian leadership must respect the Haitian Constitution and the rule of law. It is, in the last analysis, the people of Haiti who bear the pain and the suffering of intransigence.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk08-pa01">The international community stands ready to help, but Haiti must take the first steps. Without clear political will to commit to reform, the situation will not change. President Aristide and the democratic opposition must commit themselves, in a concrete and convincing way, to work together to put an end to the bloodshed and to restore the rule of law and respect for human rights. And they must act urgently.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk10-pa01">For our part, we, the international community, must now ready ourselves to respond when the conditions are right -- not to defend one side or the other, but to protect the people of Haiti by restoring order and by creating a stable environment to enable democratic processes to unfold. Canada will do its part in such a coordinated and authorized international response.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk10-pa02">The humanitarian situation in parts of Haiti is becoming severe. Violence is joining forces with poverty to deprive thousands of Haitians of food, water and medical care. President Aristide, the leaders of the democratic opposition and leaders of armed groups must give unequivocal direction to their supporters to refrain from attacking civilians, to allow humanitarian personnel safe access and to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those in need. Haiti's neighbours also have a role to play in facilitating aid delivery and in giving safe haven to displaced persons in search of safety.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aranibar Quiroga</span> <span class="nation">Bolivia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa01">Mr. President, I would like to express my delegation's thanks to you for having convened this meeting of the Security Council to consider the situation in the sister republic of Haiti. We welcome the presence, at the beginning of this meeting, of the Secretary-General, as well as that of the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa02">Bolivia has already expressed its deep concern regarding the serious situation in Haiti at the General Assembly meeting convened by its President, Mr. Julian Hunte, to hear the report of the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs. At this time, we would like to emphasize the significance of having this item addressed in the Security Council, since we consider that the situation of Haiti deserves speedy and determined action on the part of this important body entrusted with the preservation of peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa03">The international community has also expressed its concern in statements and through the steps taken by regional organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). For its part, the United Nations has announced the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General. Unfortunately, all of these steps have, as yet, had very limited results.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa04">The Security Council must play a decisive role in finding solutions to the worsening of the Haitian crisis by taking urgent and agreed upon steps and measures to deal with this situation, which could lead to even more serious consequences. We are thus faced with the moral and political imperative to do our utmost to avoid any more suffering on the part of the Haitian people. The action of the Council, in our opinion, must be directed towards finding solutions in the following four areas: political, security, humanitarian, and economic and financial.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa05">On the political front, a dialogue must begin as soon as possible among the Government, the opposition and the rebel groups to find a peaceful, institutional and negotiated outcome to this crisis. We do understand that the situation is complex, that positions have become extreme, that tempers are running high, but efforts must be redoubled on the political front before it is too late.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa06">Insofar as security is concerned, there is talk about sending a quick response multinational force to stabilize the country and, in particular, to avoid further clashes and suffering on the part of the Haitian people. We would view with interest and would support a Security Council decision to create and dispatch a multinational peace and stability force to Haiti. The Haitian Government has appealed for assistance from the international community and a response must be given.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa07">The precarious situation in which humanitarian assistance is being carried out is also cause for great concern. We understand the difficulty of the prevailing conditions and we support those organizations that are making heroic efforts in the field to bring food and medicine to the neediest people. It is essential to appeal to the international community, to Governments, to institutions and to governmental and non-governmental organizations to speed up and increase humanitarian assistance. We are facing here a situation that also calls for urgent and immediate action.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa08">The fourth front, to which notably scant attention has been paid, is the economic, social and institutional development of Haiti. It is important to rely on an emergency plan from the economic, financial and institutional point of view, followed by a medium and long-term plan that will ensure economic, social and environmental development. A solution to the political, security and humanitarian assistance crises, however vital at this time, will nonetheless not suffice in the medium and long term. A true, viable and feasible plan, along with the necessary resources, is needed that would give real opportunities to all sectors of the population and would entail new activities and raise new hope. Otherwise, we will again be faced with a situation that has all-too-familiar consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk06-pa09">The international community, particularly the Latin American and Caribbean region, expresses its deep concern for the fate of the sister people of Haiti and stands united in calling on the Council to take the necessary steps to achieve a political and diplomatic solution that is peaceful and institutional, thereby avoiding further suffering on the part of the noble Haitian people. These measures must be taken with the urgency that the situation requires.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">My delegation appreciates the convening of this open meeting and the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas today.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">Guatemala is exercising the pro tempore presidency of the Central American Integration System this semester. It is therefore in that capacity that I have the honour to intervene on behalf, not only of my own country, but also of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, as well as the Dominican Republic, an associate member of the System. We all view with the greatest concern and distress the deterioration of the situation in our sister country of Haiti. This deterioration is evolving on three planes, namely, economic, political and humanitarian.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">These three facets are, needless to say, interrelated, and therefore necessitate an integrated approach. We believe that the initiative launched by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Organization of American States (OAS), with the support of the Governments of Canada, France and the United States of America, points in that direction, and we appeal to the parties -- the Government and the democratic opposition -- to reach an agreement on the basis of the content of this initiative in a peaceful and constitutional manner. We accordingly urge all parties to refrain from the use of violence.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">Despite the democratic opposition's negative response to the Plan proposed by CARICOM and the OAS, we urge them to reconsider their position, since we feel that this Plan is the best option for preventing further bloodshed and finding solutions consistent with the internal legal order and the rules of the inter-American system, to which we all belong. For Haitians to be able to resolve their differences in a peaceful and democratic manner that is respectful of human rights is important, not only for Haiti, but also for all Latin American and Caribbean countries.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">We also appeal to the international community and to the United Nations system to contribute to easing the grave humanitarian situation afflicting the population of Haiti, particularly as regards access to food, health care, personal security and shelter. On the other hand, if the Plan proposed by CARICOM and the OAS coalesces, we hope the international community will participate in efforts and projects that will enable the country to reinvigorate its economy with a view to its long-term development.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Pulido Santana</span> <span class="nation">Venezuela</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa01">The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like to thank the President of the Security Council, Ambassador Wang Guangya, for having convened this important meeting to address the grave situation besetting our sister Caribbean country, Haiti. We are pleased that the Secretary-General was here at the beginning of the meeting. We also welcome the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica and the Bahamas.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa02">Whatever happens in the sister Republic of Haiti is a matter of deepest concern for Venezuela, and we carefully follow developments in its internal affairs. The joint communiqué issued yesterday by the Rio Group, which was mentioned by the representative of Brazil at this meeting, clearly reflects the position of Venezuela on the situation in Haiti. Accordingly, the Government of Venezuela would like to reiterate its complete support for the constitutional Government of Haiti, of which Jean-Bertrand Aristide is the President, and firmly rejects all attempts to overthrow the constitution of that country or to make any changes in it concerning the fixed terms for the election of authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa03">We also support steps taken by the Organization of American States (OAS), the natural forum for considering this situation. We fully support the efforts of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to find a peaceful and negotiated solution within the Haitian constitutional framework.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa04">We express our wish that efforts to achieve an immediate cessation of violence and the speedy restoration of peace to the country will continue. As we had the opportunity to say at the briefing on Haiti that was convened by the President of the General Assembly in a timely and appropriate fashion on 20 February, we hope that mechanisms of the United Nations will prompt the international community to deal directly with the humanitarian emergency that is currently besetting Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa05">In that context, we reiterate our support, expressed in the Permanent Council of the OAS, to contribute to alleviating the serious humanitarian situation through a financial contribution and to support other initiatives that stem from the San José Agreement and the Caracas Agreement on Energy Cooperation. At the same time, Venezuela will be sending emergency supplies such as food and medicine.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa06">We stress that it is crucial for the international community to express and show its solidarity with the people and the democratic institutions of Haiti that are threatened today. Venezuela welcomes the Secretary-General's decision to appoint a Special Adviser, as well as the opening of an office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa07">Venezuela views with optimism the efforts undertaken by the United Nations to support regional steps to find a peaceful and democratic solution to the Haitian crisis. Our country remains optimistic concerning the results of efforts under way in the United Nations and in regional organizations, and we hope that they will effectively support one another, with a view to finding a speedy solution to the Haitian conflict.</p>

	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Argentina.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mayoral</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">At the outset, let me commend you, Mr. President, for convening today's meeting. My country welcomes the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica, The Honourable K. D. Knight, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, who have expressed their concern with respect to the problem of Haiti, which is so close to those countries. Argentina has expressed its support for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Plan of Action, and we regret its rejection by the Haitian opposition.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">We believe we should also mention resolution <a href="../pdf/CP-862.pdf" class="nolink">CP/862</a> of the Organization of American States (OAS), which calls on the Security Council to take necessary emergency measures and reaffirms support for the OAS special mission in Haiti. We also believe it important to note that that resolution seeks to ensure coordination and complementarity in the roles of the OAS and the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">My country, which is current Chairman of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) affirmed on 18 February, that the Governments of MERCOSUR and its associated States, deplore the acts of violence in the Republic of Haiti. Unfortunately, there has been no resolution of those events, which have only increased and worsened. We consider it essential to help Haitian society reach a political agreement that will bring about an end to the violence and confrontation, within the framework of institutional law.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">Argentina condemns the bloodshed perpetrated by armed gangs that have risen against the Government. At the same time, we regret the inability of the Government and the opposition to reach an agreement on the basis of the CARICOM Plan of Action. We also join in calling on the parties to show restraint. We believe that the solution must involve dialogue between the Government and the opposition, while respecting constitutional order and the principles and values embodied in the Inter-American Democratic Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">We also support the initiative of France, to invite the parties to Paris, for negotiations as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">Argentina calls on all the forces in Haiti to respect human rights. We believe that the international community must insist that human rights be fully respected and that violations cease, before it is too late. There have already been too many victims in this confrontation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">Similarly, we are facing a serious humanitarian and security situation that we see deteriorating with each passing hour. There is the risk of a major catastrophe. It is thus urgent that the international community provide humanitarian assistance. In that connection, Argentina is ready to send an aeroplane with three tons of food and medicine and qualified emergency personnel, as part of a White Helmet effort.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">For years, the international community has been acting in support of Haiti. The Security Council, the General Assembly and subsidiary bodies of the United Nations have all had the situation in Haiti on their agenda. Missions have been created in the past and Special Representatives of the Secretary-General have been appointed, including one from Argentina. Unfortunately, regional organizations and States that have actively supported Haiti, such as our country, have not been able to change the situation. In spite of all the international measures, crises in Haiti continue to reoccur. This shows that international efforts have fallen short in terms of finding a solution to the political conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">The situation in Haiti is not simply a result of disagreement among political factions that are unable to get along democratically. There are also expressions of disillusionment and frustration due to the injustice and the extreme poverty in which the Haitian people have long been living. Those conditions are not exclusive to Haiti; unfortunately, many areas of Latin America and the Caribbean -- along with a large part of the planet -- are in a similar situation, where extreme poverty threatens democratic stability and peace. We need to understand the impact the realties of desperate social conditions and poverty have on the viability of democracy in nations. That is a fact that we need to address through appropriate measures.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">The most urgent task is to end the terrible conflict taking place in Haiti. But it will not be a short process. We will not resolve this situation overnight with an international presence. To bring about a genuine solution, we must have true international cooperation, increased development assistance and the creation of economic conditions that provide for equal and non-discriminatory participation in the world economy. The economic and social dimension of the conflict in Haiti calls for all members of the international community, particularly the richest and most powerful, to work with the United Nations to put an end to a situation which today affects all humanity.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Rivero</span> <span class="nation">Peru</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I congratulate you, Ambassador Wang Guangya, on your presidency of the Security Council this month and I thank you for convening this necessary debate on the grave crisis in Haiti. I also thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica, The Honourable Keith Knight, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, Mr. Frederick Mitchell, for the valuable information they presented to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">The Security Council cannot fail to take action to prevent the violence, the chaos and the humanitarian crisis from spreading in Haiti, a Member State that lies only a few hours by plane from the Headquarters of our Organization. Peru has no doubt that the Council will shoulder its responsibility in dealing with this profound political and humanitarian crisis, as requested in the resolution adopted today by the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States (OAS).</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">Peru vehemently rejects the use of violence to resolve political crises in any part of the world. It therefore reaffirms its profound conviction that the most rational formula for resolving the crisis in Haiti is to achieve political peace and stability while strictly respecting of the country's constitution. Any solution of the crisis now before the Council must be achieved through a constitutional formula -- in other words, according to the rule of law and in respect of the constitutional order of Haiti. The solution found must also be guided by the Inter-American Democratic Charter and find inspiration in the initiative of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which was endorsed today by the Organization of American States.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">Peru affirms that no effort should be spared to achieve peace and social stability in Haiti and, in accordance with today's statement by the Rio Group, vehemently condemns the acts of violence that have occurred and expresses once again its support for a peaceful solution to the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">Haiti is among the Latin American countries with the greatest social problems. What is occurring in Haiti is undoubtedly the result of great social crisis and the erosion of the country's social fabric. Its population has been suffering countless shortages for years and is frustrated. We must take the crisis in Haiti seriously. We are deeply concerned at the humanitarian situation in the country. It is a serious problem on which the international community, and especially the United Nations, must take urgent action. We therefore view positively the present intention of the United Nations to strengthen humanitarian activities. Peru welcomes all initiatives for long-term assistance to Haiti, not just short-term humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">Peru believes that the Security Council must send a clear signal that it is ready to take action and that it is monitoring respect for human rights in Haiti. All political and social forces in the country should be fully aware that the international community will not permit any violation of human rights to go unpunished.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">Finally, I believe it is necessary that the objectives of the United Nations in this crisis not be limited to finding a momentary political solution. Rather, once the crisis is resolved, it should initiate a permanent strengthening of democracy and the institutions in the country, stabilize it and help the people of Haiti to improve their deplorable social and economic situation. That is the best strategy for preventing civil conflicts and achieving stability in the world.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, we welcome your initiative of convening this important meeting to hear the views of the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean countries on the conflict afflicting Haiti. As well, we welcome the presence of the Foreign Ministers of Jamaica and the Bahamas.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">As the representative of the Government of the Dominican Republic, I would like to state that the acute and lamentable socio-political crisis afflicting the territory of the brotherly Republic of Haiti is of profound concern to the Dominican Republic since we share the same island and that, as a result, the events and the grave insecurity in Haiti will have great repercussions for my country in the economic, migratory and humanitarian areas.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">The President of the Dominican Republic, Mr. Hipólito Mejía Domínguez, spoke before the forum of nations during the General Assembly's Millennium Summit about the worrisome situation in Haiti and asked the international community, in particular the developed nations, to extend their assistance and cooperation in order to find solutions to the economic, social and humanitarian problems affecting our brotherly nation. Our President and our Minister for Foreign Affairs have reiterated this message in all international forums. Had those appeals been heeded, we could have avoided the chaotic situation in which Haiti finds itself today. In that connection, we welcome the Secretary-General's announcement that he will appoint a Special Adviser on Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">We express our fervent desire that Haiti will overcome its political and humanitarian crisis within the framework of international law and the norms of peaceful coexistence. We support the Organization of American States resolution urging Haiti to resolve its internal crisis within the framework of its constitution, and we support all the humanitarian initiatives proposed by the Caribbean Community.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">My Government reiterates its offer of its good offices in the search for mechanisms that can help resolve this foretold crisis and reiterates its call on the international community, in particular the developed countries, to extend immediate assistance to the Republic of Haiti in order to prevent further disaster and sorrow in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Finally, I inform the Council that the Government of the Dominican Republic has decided to suspend the repatriation of undocumented Haitians found in Dominican territory.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Berruga</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa01">I wish to thank the President of the Security Council, Ambassador Wang, for having convened this open meeting to consider the situation in Haiti. We have listened attentively and with much appreciation to the statements made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica and Bahamas, who shared with us the view of the member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in the search for a peaceful solution to the crisis besetting that fraternal country.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa02">To those expressions we can add the continental appeal set out this morning by the Organization of American States (OAS), urging the Security Council of the United Nations to take the necessary and appropriate steps to restore peace to Haiti and security to the people. My country was an active promoter of this appeal from the regional organization, with the purpose of ensuring that it had the greatest possible resonance in the Security Council. On the basis of that continental consensus, and in light of the gravity of the Haitian crisis, Mexico reiterates its support for the mediation initiative by CARICOM countries and also expresses its sternest condemnation of violence and calls for its immediate cessation.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa03">The two priorities in the current situation are absolute respect for human rights and facilitating the work of international agencies involved in humanitarian assistance and protection of the civilian population. Mexico reiterates its solidarity with the Haitian people. In this connection my country is in contact with other Governments in the region and with the Group of Friends to study possible joint measures.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa04">In light of the gravity of the crisis and the possibility of a violent takeover, Mexico believes it necessary to consider confidence-building measures, to secure support from financial institutions and to weigh the dispatching of a multinational force, mandated by the United Nations, to contribute to the pacification of Haiti. We consider that a return to dialogue and negotiation acceptable to all actors is a matter of urgency to avoid further bloodshed and the spillover of the humanitarian crisis to neighbouring countries. We support a political solution that makes room for all opinions and forces in the country to promote national unity. We appeal to the opposition to reconsider, with a sense of responsibility and urgency, the offers of international mediation that have been put forward.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa05">Mexico emphasizes that it is important that there be a presidential statement at the conclusion of this debate. We consider that that statement should, in and of itself, be an initial tool to hasten and facilitate the immediate cessation of violence and the start of political negotiations. We trust that this message from the United Nations would be heeded by the Haitians so that order, security and institutional life can be restored without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa06">It is still possible to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict. In this connection we call upon the Secretary-General to deploy the necessary media forces to ensure that the presidential statement is clearly heard by the entire Haitian society. Furthermore, we support the intention of the Secretary-General to name a Special Adviser for Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa07">The gravity of this crisis demands a study of the mandate and actions that could determine the Council's activities. In our opinion, the mandate should have five components: first, the protection of the civilian population; secondly, the distribution of humanitarian assistance; thirdly, to contribute to the restoration of order and the cessation of violence; fourthly, to assist in disarmament; and lastly, to guarantee any political agreements reached by the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa08">We are sure that members of the Security Council will take into account the views that have been expressed this afternoon when it adopts a decision.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Carbo</span> <span class="nation">Ecuador</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">I would like to express my thanks for making possible this open debate in the Security Council to enable the international community to grasp the magnitude of the problems besetting Haiti. I also wish to thank the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica and Bahamas for their statements on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which, together with the reports by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs yesterday, have made it possible for Member States to have an accurate picture of the gravity of the crisis in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">The serious developments of recent weeks prompt me to express my deep concern about the violence and political instability besetting this sisterly country, as well as the full support of Ecuador for its democratic institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">This meeting gives us an opportunity to urge the democratic institutions, the political leadership and the Haitian people, with the urgency that the situation merits, to establish channels of dialogue and democratic understanding that will make it possible to find a peaceful solution to the current problems in that country and to achieve the national reconciliation that would make its democratic life more robust and would strengthen its efforts to improve the political, economic and social conditions with a view to ensuring prosperity and sustainable development for future generations within a framework of peace, tolerance and national concord.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">Ecuador considers that, as a prerequisite to achieving a negotiated settlement of the crisis, the current spiral of violence must be halted in order to avoid further bloodshed and a worsening of the humanitarian emergency. In that context, there must be greater participation on the part of the international community to guarantee access to this assistance by the most vulnerable segments of the population, in order to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe with greater consequences. The Security Council and the United Nations must play a leading role, in coordination with the Organization of American States (OAS) and CARICOM.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">My country is convinced that the current crisis must be resolved peacefully within the context of the Haitian legal order. We therefore would like to emphasize our strong support for the constitutional, democratic system in that sister country, as well as for the efforts to date by the OAS and CARICOM and the Group of Friends of Haiti with a view to stabilizing the situation in that fraternal Caribbean country, preserving its legal, constitutional and political order, protecting human rights and avoiding an institutional and humanitarian crisis that would affect not only the Haitian people but also the neighbouring countries and the Caribbean region as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">Finally, in the knowledge that the resolution adopted by the Permanent Council of the OAS urges this body to take necessary and appropriate steps, as set out in the United Nations Charter, to dealing with the crisis in Haiti, I wish to express our country's support for that resolution of the American regional organ and urge the Security Council to adopt the pertinent decisions with all due urgency in order to stabilize the situation in Haiti.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sevilla Somoza</span> <span class="nation">Nicaragua</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">I should like to tell you how pleased my delegation is that you, Mr. President, have convened this important meeting. We also wish to welcome the presence of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Bahamas and Jamaica.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">I first wish to endorse what was said by the representative of Guatemala, speaking on behalf of the Central American Integration System. However, in view of the bonds that unite us with the Haitian people, we would like to make our own comments as well.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">The people and Government of Nicaragua -- a country that suffered a years-long civil war that caused thousands of deaths, casualties and maimed and made our economy slip back at least 40 years -- can do no less than express our solidarity and concern at the current crisis in the sister Republic of Haiti. Rebel forces opposing President Jean Bertrand Aristide have taken at least two of the main cities and have destabilized the political order in many other parts of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">The military conflict in Haiti -- above and beyond the physical violence that has in a terrible manner produced a huge number of dead and wounded -- has worsened the situation for the 8 million inhabitants of the poorest country in the continent, a situation characterized by famine and lack of drinking water, medication, fuel, transportation and electricity. This has the greatest impact on the weakest parts of society -- women, children and the elderly.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">The crisis threatens to spread, in some form, to other countries of the region. They would have to seek international assistance to deal with the flow of refugees that the conflict could cause if it persisted or intensified. The Organization of American States (OAS) and Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have taken a number of initiatives with a view to resolving the problems besetting our brethren, the people of Haiti. They have condemned the violence and have voiced the urgency of a peaceful settlement of the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa06">The most recent of those initiatives was a multilateral mission to Haiti with the participation of the United States, France, Canada, CARICOM and the OAS. CARICOM offered a concrete proposal intended to restore confidence among the various armed groups and to begin a process of détente that could facilitate dialogue with opposition forces and civil society. But that Plan of Action has not yet come to fruition, because it has been accepted only by President Aristide. We hope it can soon be adopted by the opposition as well.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa07">The Government of Nicaragua deplores the violence and the loss of life in Haiti, and calls on all the conflicting parties, including the Government, to respect human rights, cease violence and hostility and begin dialogue in accordance with the CARICOM Plan, with a view to a peaceful and democratic settlement of these disputes.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa08">We fully support President Aristide in the quest for a solution consistent with the Haitian constitutional order and the principles of the Inter-American Democratic Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa09">We call on the international community, and on the United Nations system in particular, to help the Haitian people to improve the grave humanitarian situation by providing food, medicine, blankets and other goods that can improve the present serious situation of the people of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa10">We echo resolution <a href="../pdf/CP-862.pdf" class="nolink">CP/862</a>, adopted today on this subject by the Permanent Council of the OAS, by which that body resolved, inter alia, to "call upon the United Nations Security Council to take the necessary and appropriate urgent measures, as established in the Charter of the United Nations, to address the crisis in Haiti".</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motomura</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, my delegation welcomes your decision to convene today, at the request of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), an emergency public meeting concerning the situation in Haiti. We believe that this action testifies to the international community's concern over the deterioration of the situation in Haiti and its commitment to achieving a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In addition, since the start of the violence at the beginning of this month, we have been pleased to see that concerned parties, led by CARICOM and the Organization of American States (OAS), have formulated a Plan Of Action for the restoration of stability in Haiti. Since the end of last week, those regional organizations, in cooperation with the United States, France and Canada, have sent missions to Haiti to propose a mediated agreement that must be accepted by both the Government and the opposition, and through diplomatic efforts have been working to persuade both parties to accept it. My delegation believes that the elements contained in the Plan of Action provide an important basis for a negotiated settlement and urges both parties to show the utmost flexibility in order to achieve a peaceful political resolution through dialogue. In that connection, we take note of the proposal explained by France earlier this afternoon.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">My Government is gravely concerned about the humanitarian issues in Haiti posed by the continuing conflict and the resulting food shortages and worsening health and education conditions. Halting further deterioration in the humanitarian situation requires an immediate end to the violence. We fear that, should the conflict continue to escalate and should it spread to the capital city of Port-au-Prince, even greater human casualties and property damage will result.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">Since the restoration of the Aristide presidency in 1994, the Japanese Government has provided in excess of $200 million in economic cooperation with Haiti, the bulk of which has been in the form of grant aid assistance. However, due to the deterioration of the security situation as a result of the continuing conflict, there have been unavoidable delays in the implementation of economic assistance, and this has led to a vicious circle in which the further delaying of Haiti's economic development makes it difficult for a democratic political system to take hold. And those sustaining the damage are the general populace, in particular women and children, who are the most vulnerable members of society. My Government hopes that, by bringing the conflict quickly to a halt, the vicious circle can be broken and an environment conducive to cooperation for Haiti's economic development by the international community, including Japan, can be restored at the earliest possible date.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">In addition, Japan requests that, as soon as the security situation is ameliorated, a needs assessment be carried out on the ground, primarily by United Nations agencies, for the purpose of responding to the urgent humanitarian situation in Haiti. We further strongly request that the parties to the conflict allow access for the required humanitarian activities and that the other countries concerned exert themselves through a variety of channels to persuade the parties to permit such access.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">We believe that a peaceful political resolution, achieved through dialogue between the parties, is the best possible strategy. For that purpose, a committed effort on the part of both parties is required. My Government supports the continued efforts made in solidarity by the international community to bring about political stability in Haiti.</p>

	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa01">I wish at the outset, Sir, to express our appreciation for your efforts as President of the Security Council for the month of February to promote a resolution of the crisis in Haiti. I wish also to thank the delegation of Jamaica, which on behalf of the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) requested this emergency meeting of the Council. We are pleased to see the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica and of the Bahamas at this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa02">The International Organization of la Francophonie is following closely and with grave concern developments in the situation in Haiti, which has been a member of our organization since 1970. Ministers of our organization's member States, meeting at Paris in December 2003 at the nineteenth session of the Ministerial Conference of la Francophonie, considered in depth the situation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa03">Our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf, has repeatedly condemned the acts of violence, irrespective of their origin, and human rights abuses in that country. He has stated his grave concern at the deterioration of the humanitarian situation and has reaffirmed his commitment to a peaceful resolution of the crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa04">La Francophonie was part of the high-level international delegation that visited Port-au-Prince several days ago in an urgent attempt to promote a political resolution of the crisis. Because of the present risk of chaos in Haiti, the International Organization of la Francophonie appeals for an end to the violence and encourages the quest for an agreed peaceful solution, so that peace, democracy and the rule of law can return to that country.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa05">I should like to assure the Council of our full support for the international community's efforts in the quest for such a peaceful solution and to reaffirm our readiness to participate in any action to promote the implementation of the Bamako Declaration on the practices of democracy, rights and freedoms in the French-speaking community.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk04-pa06">The Secretary-General of the International Organization of la Francophonie will preside over a meeting, to be held in Paris on 2 March 2004, of an ad hoc advisory group on Haiti to determine what contribution our organization can make in support of the international community's action on behalf of Haiti. We trust that the Council will swiftly take the steps necessary to deal with the dangerous situation in Haiti and to help re-establish order and security in the country, thereby opening the way for coordinated action by the international community aimed at consolidating peace and rebuilding the country -- action to which la Francophonie will not fail to make its contribution.</p>

	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa02">"The Security Council expresses deep concern in regard to the deterioration of the political, security and humanitarian environment in Haiti. It deplores the loss of life that has already occurred and fears that the failure, thus far, to reach a political settlement may result in further bloodshed. Continued violence and the breakdown of law and order in Haiti could have destabilizing effects in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa03">"The Security Council commends the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) for their lead role in promoting a peaceful solution and for trying to re-establish confidence among the parties, in particular through their Plan of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa04">"The Council supports CARICOM and the OAS as they continue to work towards a peaceful and constitutional solution to the current impasse. The principles outlined in the CARICOM/OAS Plan of Action represent an important basis for a solution to the crisis. The Council calls upon the parties to act responsibly by choosing negotiation instead of confrontation. An accelerated timetable now seems necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa05">"The Security Council is deeply concerned with the prospect of further violence in Haiti and acknowledges the call for international involvement in Haiti. The Council will consider urgently options for international engagement, including that of an international force in support of a political settlement in accordance with the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa06">"The Council calls upon all sides in Haiti's conflict to facilitate the distribution of food and medicine and ensure the protection of civilians. It calls upon all sides to respect international humanitarian personnel and facilities and to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those who need it.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa07">"The Council calls upon the Government and all other parties to respect human rights and to cease the use of violence to advance political goals. Those responsible for human rights violations will be held accountable.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa08">"The Security Council supports the Secretary-General's decision to name a Special Adviser for Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa09">"The Security Council will continue to monitor closely the situation in Haiti and remains seized of the matter."</p>
