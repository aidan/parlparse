	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa01">The General Assembly will proceed to the election of five members of the International Court of Justice for a nine-year term of office commencing on 6 February 2006. The terms of office of the following judges expire on 5 February 2006: Mr. Vladlen Vereshchetin (Russian Federation), Mr. Pieter Kooijmans (Netherlands), Mr. Francisco Rezek (Brazil), Mr. Thomas Buergenthal (United States of America) and Mr. Nabil Elaraby (Egypt).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa02">In connection with the election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the members of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa03">I should like to confirm that, at this time, the Security Council, independently of the General Assembly, is also proceeding to elect five members of the Court. This procedure is in accordance with Article 8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg001-bk03-pa04">"The General Assembly and the Security Council shall proceed independently of one another to elect the members of the Court."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa05">Accordingly, the results of the voting in the General Assembly will be communicated to the Security Council only when five candidates have obtained the required majority in the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa06">I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. Document <a href="../pdf/A-60-186.pdf">A/60/186</a> contains a memorandum by the Secretary-General on the present composition of the Court and the procedure to be followed in the General Assembly and in the Security Council with regard to the election. Document <a href="../pdf/A-60-187.pdf">A/60/187</a> and corrigendum 1 contain the list of candidates nominated by national groups.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa07">In this connection, I have received information from the Legal Counsel that, after the established deadline for nominating candidates, the following additional submissions were received from several national groups, all of which relate to the candidates already nominated by other national groups appearing in documents <a href="../pdf/A-60-187.pdf">A/60/187</a> and corrigendum 1: Mohamed Bennouna (Morocco) has been nominated also by the national group of Argentina and Jordan; Thomas Buergenthal (United States of America) has been nominated also by the national group of Germany, Peru and Romania; Julio D. González Campos (Spain) has been nominated also by the national group of Argentina; Kenneth Keith (New Zealand) has been nominated also by the national group of Germany, Luxembourg and Papua New Guinea; Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor (Mexico) has been nominated also by the national group of Argentina, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania; and Leonid Skotnikov (Russian Federation) has been nominated also by the national group of Germany and Romania.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa08">I should also like to draw the attention of the Assembly to a note by the Secretary-General, contained in an addendum to document <a href="../pdf/A-60-187.pdf">A/60/187</a>, which was issued this morning, in which he informs me that the national group of Niger decided to withdraw its nomination of Mr. Seidou Adamou Mazou as a candidate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa09">The Assembly also has before it document <a href="../pdf/A-60-188.pdf">A/60/188</a> and corrigendum 1, which contains the curricula vitae of the candidates nominated by the national groups.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa10">In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa11">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General Assembly are all 191 Member States. Accordingly, for the present election, 96 votes constitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa12">Pursuant to rule 151 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly, if in the first ballot the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than five, a second ballot will be held and balloting will continue at the same meeting until five candidates have obtained the required majority.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa13">At its 915th meeting, on 16 November 1960, the General Assembly decided that ballots shall be unrestricted. That decision has been followed consistently.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa14">I should like to bring another matter to the attention of the General Assembly. Cases have arisen in the Security Council in which more than the required number of candidates have obtained an absolute majority on the same ballot. The same also occurred in the General Assembly, at the 45th plenary meeting of the fifty-fourth session, on 3 November 1999.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa15">Both organs decided to hold a new ballot on all the candidates, and no notification to the President of the other organ was made until only the required number of candidates, and no more, had obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa16">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to the same procedure should the case arise at this election?</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg002-bk01">
	It was so decided.

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa03">Any announcements, including those concerning withdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made prior to the commencement of the voting process, that is to say before the announcement of the beginning of the voting process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa04">I should like to seek the usual cooperation of representatives during the time of the conduct of the election. Please be reminded that during the voting process all campaigning should cease in the General Assembly Hall. This means in particular that once the election has begun no more campaign material can be distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also requested to remain at their seats so that the voting process can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank representatives in advance for their cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa05">We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot papers will now be distributed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa06">Representatives are requested to use only the ballot papers now being distributed. Only those candidates whose names appear on the ballot papers are eligible. Representatives will indicate the five candidates for whom they wish to vote by placing crosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers. Ballot papers on which more than five names are marked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names appear on the ballot papers.</div>
