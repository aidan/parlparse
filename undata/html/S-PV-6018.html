The humanitarian situation is becoming more dire all the time. While we are pleased with the increase in the number of peacekeepers who will be sent to that part of the country, we wish to also underline that it goes along with the political process, which is also necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">We are pleased that the Secretary-General appointed former President Obasanjo to assist in the political process, and the good news is that the infrastructure for such a political process is contained in the Goma agreement and the Nairobi agreement, which are both available to the parties in the area to use to resolve the political situation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">We hope that the resolution will also act as an encouragement, saying that we want more troops to go in and assist people, but that it will also encourage the political process.</p>
