	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa01">In connection with <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.63</a>, on the commemorative high-level plenary meeting devoted to the follow-up to the outcome of the special session on children, I wish to place on record the following statement of financial implications, on behalf of the Secretary-General, in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa02">Under the terms of operative paragraphs 1, 3, 10 and 11 of the draft resolution, respectively, the General Assembly would:</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa03">"[Decide] to convene a commemorative high-level plenary meeting to evaluate progress made in the implementation of the Declaration and the Plan of Action contained in the document entitled `A world fit for children' on 11 and 12 December 2007;"</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa04">"[Decide] that the commemorative high-level plenary meeting will comprise plenary meetings and two thematic interactive round tables;"</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa05">"[Request] the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive analytical report on progress achieved and challenges remaining in implementing the commitments set out in the Declaration and the Plan of Action at least six weeks prior to its consideration by the General Assembly at its sixty-second session;"</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa06">and</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa07">"[Decide] that the chairpersons of the interactive round tables will present summaries of the discussions at the closing plenary meeting".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa08">Pursuant to those operative paragraphs of the draft resolution, it is understood that the commemorative high-level plenary meeting would comprise a total of four General Assembly plenary meetings with simultaneous interpretation and verbatim records in the six official languages of the United Nations, as well as two parallel round tables with simultaneous interpretation in the six official languages. Documentation requirements are estimated at 32 pages of pre-session and four pages of in-session documents, to be issued in all six languages. No post-session documentation is foreseen.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa09">Should the General Assembly adopt <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.63</a>, no additional conference servicing resources would be required for the four General Assembly plenary meetings and documentation indicated earlier, on the understanding that these are part of the normal work of the General Assembly, for which resources have already been budgeted throughout the year according to its entitlements.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa10">As regards the two parallel round tables, these would constitute an addition to the draft calendar of conferences and meetings of the United Nations, for which it is estimated that implementation would involve additional conference servicing resources in the total amount of $22,500 under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, of the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk11-pa11">Although no provisions have been made under the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 for servicing the two parallel round tables as envisaged in the draft resolution, the necessary requirements would be accommodated to the fullest extent possible from within existing provisions of the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007, and resources required over and above the existing capacity would be accommodated by the United Nations Children's Fund. Therefore, should the General Assembly adopt <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.63</a>, no additional conference servicing resources would be required for the servicing of the two parallel round tables.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Pérez Álvarez</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">The delegation of Cuba would like briefly to explain its position on <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.63</a>, which is before us today.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">The delegation of Cuba would like to thank those countries which, for several weeks, contributed to the negotiations on this draft resolution, which outlines organizational arrangements for the holding of the commemorative high-level plenary meeting devoted to the follow-up to the outcome of the special session on children. My delegation would also like to commend the representative of Belarus for his efforts as facilitator during the negotiating process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">Cuba reaffirms its steadfast commitment to the Declaration and the Plan of Action contained in the document entitled "A world fit for children" (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-S-27-2.pdf" class="nolink">resolution S-27/2</a>, annex). We acknowledge that its implementation is closely linked to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. That being said, the delegation of Cuba would like to express its understanding of paragraph 7, in the light of what representatives of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) stated to delegations during the negotiations: organizations accredited to UNICEF already have consultative status with the Economic and Social Council, unlike those in a collaborative relationship with UNICEF, which are not in that category and to which the no-objection procedure would apply for a final decision by the General Assembly on the matter.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">The delegation of Cuba would also like to point out an error in paragraph 12 of the draft resolution. The word "commitment" should be replaced by the word "commitments".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">Once again, I would like to thank the Secretariat for its efforts throughout the entire negotiating process, which went on for several months.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa06">Here, I would like to recall the words of José Martí, the champion of Cuban independence: "Children being the hope of the world". That sums up the highest aspirations of humankind -- which, however, is obliged to struggle for this reality. That should be the objective of our work and of open, transparent negotiations -- which we hope will continue under the President of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly -- among all Member States present in this room.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">The United States would like to make an explanation of position after the adoption.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">The United States joined consensus on <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.63</a> reluctantly. We would have preferred that paragraph 12 of this resolution left more discretion to the President of the General Assembly as to the appropriate format and methodology for arriving at an outcome of the commemorative high-level plenary meeting. The United States would have been satisfied with a chairman's statement or summary as the outcome of the commemorative meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">The Declaration and Plan of Action contained in "A world fit for children" (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-S-27-2.pdf" class="nolink">resolution S-27/2</a>, annex) adopted by consensus in 2002 and still relevant and applicable, sets out the commitments of the international community towards children. We believe that the outcome of the commemorative meeting in December 2007 should reaffirm those commitments and that every precaution should be taken by the President of the General Assembly and by Member States to keep the outcome extremely brief and to avoid re-opening, undermining or calling into question any of those commitments.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa01">My delegation would like to express its support for the draft resolution on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We will vote in favour of the draft resolution, in line with principles that we have always affirmed: that responsibility for the financing of this force should be borne by Israel, the aggressor and the occupying Power, which is responsible for the establishment of the Force. Our country's vote is in line with the general principles contained in resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa02">During the first part of the resumed session of the Fifth Committee, my delegation raised serious concerns with regard to the logical framework of the UNIFIL budget, in particular regarding the manner in which expected accomplishment 1.1, which stipulates the provision of a "Stable and secure environment in southern Lebanon" (<i><a href="../pdf/A-61-870.pdf" class="pdf">A/61/870</a>, para. 10</i>) was drafted. My delegation indicated at that time that that expression was not in line with the mandate given to UNIFIL by the Security Council and that Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1701 (2006)</a>, which strengthened the mandate of UNIFIL -- a mission established by Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 425 (1978)</a> -- could not be interpreted in that manner. We have indicated that this expression, the provision of a "stable and secure environment" in southern Lebanon as an expected accomplishment, could entail giving Israel the right to enter Lebanese territory on security pretexts -- a right that is open-ended in terms of area and time. It could also justify Israel's continued violations of Lebanese sovereignty by air, sea and land on the pretext that a "stable and secure environment" does not exist in southern Lebanon, as defined by Israeli criteria. As is well known and as has been documented, those criteria are not consistent with and do not respect the mandate of UNIFIL or <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa03">The General Assembly, in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-250.pdf" class="nolink">resolution 61/250</a> B of 2 April 2007, on the financing of UNIFIL, recognized the concerns of my delegation and requested the Secretary-General to measure the accomplishments of the Force, including expected accomplishment 1.1, fully in accordance with the Security Council mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa04">During the second part of the resumed session of the Fifth Committee, my delegation once again raised serious concerns about the manner in which expected accomplishment 1.1 was drafted. This was because the Secretariat did not reformulate that expected accomplishment in line with the Security Council mandate and in accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-250.pdf" class="nolink">General Assembly resolution 61/250</a> B.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa05">My delegation would like to confirm once again that expected accomplishment 1.1, which stipulates the provision of a "stable and secure environment" in southern Lebanon, is not linked to the two basic objectives behind the enhancement of UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)</a>. Those objectives are full respect for the Blue Line by both parties, as called for in paragraph 8 of the resolution, and the cessation of hostilities between the two parties, as mentioned in paragraph 11. We would like to indicate in this respect that the insistence on mentioning expected accomplishment 1.1 -- a stable and secure environment in southern Lebanon -- would enable Israel to continue to justify its failure to abide by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)</a> and to undermine the credibility of UNIFIL in southern Lebanon. It would also give Israel a free hand to continue its intervention and violations in southern Lebanon without any control or accountability whatsoever.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa06">We recall that Israel continues to occupy parts of southern Lebanon and that the Israeli air force still violates Lebanese airspace. This constitutes a violation of the Blue Line, which is monitored by UNIFIL, and a real threat to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon, in violation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)</a>. Those Israeli violations are confirmed in UNIFIL reports to the United Nations and in official Lebanese letters on this matter. I have before me 10 official memorandums sent by the Permanent Mission of Lebanon on Israeli violations of Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1701 (2006)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa07">This matter is now well known, as is the fact that Israel has targeted UNIFIL forces since the establishment of the Force and up until this very moment. We all remember the two Qana massacres, the first in 1996 and the second in 2006. Those two massacres are still fresh in the memory of the United Nations. I would like to indicate that the Lebanese letters and notes to which I have referred, between 14 March to 14 June 2007 -- that is, over a period of four months -- enumerated 155 Israeli violations by air, 34 by sea and 48 by land. All are violations of Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1702(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1702 (2006)</a>. They encroach on the mandate of UNIFIL and disregard the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa08">The General Assembly has once again recognized our serious concerns regarding expected accomplishment 1.1 by including paragraph 12 in the draft resolution that we will adopt shortly. It reaffirms paragraph 12 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-250.pdf" class="nolink">resolution 61/250</a> B and requests the Secretary-General to measure the expected accomplishments of the Force fully in accordance with the Security Council mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa09">On that basis, my delegation would expect the Secretary-General to reformulate expected accomplishment 1.1 in a manner consistent with the mandate of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 425 (1978)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">1701 (2006)</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Today more than ever, Lebanon is in need of the continued support of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that on Sunday, 24 June, targeted a Spanish battalion patrol in southern Lebanon and resulted in the deaths of six UNIFIL personnel and the injury of two others. The Lebanese Government expressed its solidarity with UNIFIL, denounced the attack in the strongest possible terms and committed itself to bringing the perpetrators of this heinous attack to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The Lebanese people and the Lebanese Government extend their sincere condolences to the families of the fallen victims and to the peoples and Governments of Colombia and Spain. The Lebanese people and their Government also express their wishes for the quick recovery of those injured.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The latest attack on UNIFIL underscores the importance of maintaining a stable and secure environment in southern Lebanon, as stated by the Secretary-General in his report contained in <a href="../pdf/A-61-870.pdf" class="pdf">document A/61/870</a>, on the budget for the Force for the period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008. In this regard, we reiterate our understanding, as well as that of all of the States members of this Assembly that concur with the conclusion of the Secretary-General, that expected accomplishment 1.1 set out in the UNIFIL budget report is fully in line with the mandate of the Force under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">The General Assembly, in operative paragraph 12 of its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-250.pdf" class="nolink">resolution 61/250</a> B of 2 April 2007, on the additional financing of UNIFIL, requested the Secretary-General to continue to measure the accomplishments of the Force, including expected accomplishment 1.1, fully in accordance with the Security Council mandate. In response to that request, the Secretary-General, in his current report on the budget for the Force, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-61-870.pdf" class="pdf">document A/61/870</a>, reasserted his understanding that expected accomplishment 1.1 is fully in line with UNIFIL's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The delegation of Lebanon emphasizes that paragraph 12 of the current draft resolution, contained for the time being in <a href="../pdf/AC.5-61-L.53.pdf" class="nolink">document A/C.5/61/L.53</a>, on which the Assembly is about to take a decision, only ascertains that the expected accomplishment 1.1 is fully in line with UNIFIL's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">We hope that future reports on the financing of UNIFIL will continue to take into account the views of my delegation, the delegation that is primarily concerned with this issue, which concurs with those of all of the members of the Assembly.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fluss</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">At the outset, let me express our condolences to the families and fellow soldiers of the members of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) who were attacked by terrorists at the beginning of this week in southern Lebanon. We also wish a speedy recovery to the injured.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">It is with an eerie sense of déjà vu that we have been forced to listen to manipulations by the Syrian representative, who has tried to divert expected accomplishment 1.1 entirely towards the Blue Line, whilst he is hiding behind the fact that Syria is undermining peace and stability in the region through its blatant and dangerous violation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1701 (2006)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Members need not rely solely on my words here; Syria's interference in Lebanon is addressed in the Secretary-General's forthcoming report on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1701 (2006)</a>, which I would like to cite, as the matter came up just yesterday.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">"It is widely believed in Lebanon, including by the Government, that the strengthening of Fatah-Intifada and PFLP-GC outposts could not have taken place without the tacit knowledge and support of the Syrian Government. The Prime Minister of Lebanon has recently stated publicly that these outposts have been reinforced with munitions, arms and fighters by the Syrian Arab Republic."</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">The Government of Lebanon, says the Secretary-General, has reported seeing "two vehicles heading from Al-Kafeer in the Syrian Arab Republic across the Syrian-Lebanese border".</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">In his conclusion, the Secretary-General writes</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">"I urge the Syrian Arab Republic to do more to control its border with Lebanon. I am disturbed by the persistent reports pointing to breaches of the arms embargo along the Lebanon-Syria border. I am disappointed that no further progress has been made between the Government of Lebanon and the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to take the necessary steps with Lebanon to delineate their common border."</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">Those are the words of the Secretary-General's report on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)</a> exposing Syria's underhanded tactics, dangerous meddling and malicious disobedience. Syria's wilful violation of Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1701 (2006)</a> gravely endangers the stability and security of Lebanon and the region.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">Nothing short of immediate action can change this alarming situation. That is why Israel strongly supports the logical framework, including expected accomplishment 1.1, which is intended to provide for a safe and stable environment in southern Lebanon. It is not merely a question of the Blue Line; there are many more implications. Violations are currently originating from the Syrian-Lebanese border, as reflected in the report we saw yesterday. The world knows that Syria is behind the instability in Lebanon. Actually, Prime Minister Siniora said just this week, referring to the refugee camps where internal violence is taking place within Lebanon, that "these camps have been reinforced with munitions, arms and fighters. Everyone knows that these groups are supported and armed by Syria".</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">So, everyone knows -- and I think the Syrian representative also knows -- these facts. With these words, I suggest that we not try to interfere in the understanding and rationale of the mandate of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1701 (2006)</a> and of expected accomplishment 1.1.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa01">I call on the representative of the United States of America, who wishes to speak in explanation of vote on the resolution just adopted.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hillman</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk04-pa01">Although my delegation strongly supports the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the use of a funding resolution to pursue claims against a Member State procedurally is not correct. That is the reason that we were unable to support this resolution, which includes paragraphs that were objectionable to us. And that is the reason that we requested that a vote be taken.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk05-pa01">I shall now call on those representatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind members that, in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, statements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes for the second and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ja'afari</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">My Government has officially expressed its sincere condolences to the Government and the people of Spain with regard to the deaths of members of the Spanish battalion as a result of the terrorist act committed in southern Lebanon. I also wish to express my personal condolences to the Spanish Government and to the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">The cowardly terrorist act targeting members of the Spanish battalion occurred in an area 600 metres from the Israeli-Lebanese border. Therefore, it could have been carried out with special, by-remote technology possessed by Israel.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">The manner in which the representative of Israel voted today -- against certain paragraphs in the resolution and against the resolution as a whole -- indicates Israel's aggressive posture towards international legitimacy. If Israel really had any respect for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and for international legitimacy, it would not have voted against a resolution that was nearly unanimously adopted. The Israeli representative cited a number of paragraphs from the Secretary-General's report on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2007).pdf" class="nolink">Security Council resolution 1701 (2007)</a>. He stated that the Secretary-General says such and such, presumptuously supposing what the Secretary-General has said. But what the Secretary-General actually has said confirms that Israel violated Lebanese sovereignty 33 times in only one day. That is not a supposition, but a confirmation of reports sent to the Secretary-General by UNIFIL commanders.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The Israeli representative also referred to the existence of Palestinian refugee camps and military sites in Lebanon, as if those camps and sites had nothing to do with Israel's occupation of Palestine and as if the Palestinian refugees had come from outer space and not from Palestine, from where they had been expelled, and as if those Palestinians had no relevance to resolution 194 (III), concerning the right of Palestinian refugees to return to the lands, villages and homes from which they had been forcibly expelled by Zionist gangs, first in 1948 and then in 1967.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">The Israeli representative suggested that Syria should not interfere with UNIFIL's mandate. He should give that advice to his own Government so that it stops targeting UNIFIL forces politically, militarily and in terms of security, and stops carrying out assassinations and bombing of UNIFIL sites in Lebanon. Since the establishment of the Force, the Israeli Government has killed dozens of UNIFIL troops, including, most recently, the four Chinese officers killed by Israeli forces during the recent aggression carried out against Lebanon last July.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">The Israeli representative also said that Syria's position threatens stability in the Middle East. That is his opinion and he is entitled to it, but he has forgotten that a survey undertaken in Europe last year under the aegis of the European Commission confirmed that 70 per cent of Europeans -- Europeans, not Syrians -- consider Israel to be a threat to international peace and security. He also neglected to mention that more than 1,000 resolutions have been adopted by the United Nations since its establishment condemning Israel and declaring it an aggressive occupying Power because it continues to terrorize the Palestinian people, preventing it from establishing its own State, and to occupy the lands of others by force, including territories of my country in the Syrian Golan.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">How can the Israeli representative offer advice in this context? His State is notorious throughout the world, and over 1,000 resolutions of international legitimacy have passed against it. Not one of those resolutions, nor even a single paragraph thereof, has been implemented. Israel takes "international legitimacy" to mean the implementation of merely half a resolution -- resolution 181 (II), of 1947, partitioning Palestine into two States. That resolution referred to the establishment of two States in Palestine: a Jewish State and an Arab Palestinian State. Israel has implemented only that half of the resolution, one of as many as a thousand, referring to the creation of its own State. As for the other half, it can go to hell as far as Israel is concerned. Israel is not concerned about upholding justice or the establishment of the Palestinian State in Palestine.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">I do not wish to discuss this further. The story is obvious and well known to all.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ramadan</span> <span class="nation">Lebanon</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">We take the floor to exercise the right of reply under agenda item 144. My delegation intended to limit its statement to the budgetary aspects of the resolution. However, since the Israeli representative made false accusations, we are compelled to clarify the facts.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">We also note that the Israeli representative did not respect the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, because he spoke in exercise of the right of reply when it was his turn to make an explanation of vote before the voting. I think that only shows how Israel does not in any sense respect the resolutions of this Assembly; so why should it respect its rules of procedure?</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Lebanon highly appreciates the important role that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) plays in the southern part of my country, and invites Israel to cooperate with UNIFIL as it pretends to do. The reports of the lack of Israeli cooperation with and even intimidation of UNIFIL are clear and include low-altitude flights of Israeli warplanes over UNIFIL that almost resulted in an armed retaliation by the German and French contingents of the maritime component of the Force. Also, recently, reports attributed to the spokesman of the German command of the maritime component of UNIFIL explained that three new such incidents took place between the Israeli army and the German ships, and that another separate incident took place with a Swedish ship during the months of April and May this year. This past Wednesday, 27 June, Israel was yet again denounced by a UNIFIL official for the lack of Israeli cooperation with the Force, as it seems that Israel does not want to establish a hotline of communication with the Force to tackle arising security incidents.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">We advise the Israeli representatives not to interfere in issues that pertain to our relationship with the Syrian Arab Republic. Syria is a brotherly Arab country; Syria is not our enemy. We know very well who our enemy is. It is only because we believe in further strengthening the long-standing and strong relations between Lebanon and Syria that we want to resolve all the pending issues between our two countries. It is for those reasons that we want to establish diplomatic relations and delineate the common borders between Lebanon and Syria.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">If the Israeli representative is very interested in the expected accomplishment 1.1, which calls for the establishment of a safe and secure environment in southern Lebanon, we invite Israel to withdraw its forces from occupied Lebanese lands. Lebanese lands are occupied today as we speak, be it in Sheba'a, the Kfar Shuba hills, or in the village of Rshaf. Thus, if Israel is concerned about safety in the southern part of Lebanon, we invite it to withdraw from our country.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">Lebanon is thankful and appreciative to all the friendly States that voted in favour of the resolution. Specifically, we extend our thanks to the members of the Group of 77 and China, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and the States members of the League of Arab States.</p>
