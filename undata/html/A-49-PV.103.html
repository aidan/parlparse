	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa01">As members may recall, by its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-955(1994).pdf">resolution 955 (1994)</a> of 8 November 1994 the Security Council adopted the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa02">Pursuant to article 12, paragraph 2 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, the members of the Appeals Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 shall also serve as the members of the Appeals Chamber of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa03">According to article 12, paragraph 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, the six judges of the Trial Chambers of the International Tribunal for Rwanda shall be elected by the General Assembly from a list of candidates submitted by the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa04">In connection with this election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa05">Firstly, at its 3524th meeting, on 24 April 1995, the Security Council, in accordance with article 12, subparagraph 3 (c) of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, established in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-989(1995).pdf">resolution 989 (1995)</a> a list of 12 candidates, taking due account of adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the world. The list was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by letter dated 24 April 1995 from the President of the Security Council. The letter was issued as document <a href="../pdf/A-49-889.pdf">A/49/889</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa06">Secondly, in accordance with article 12, subparagraph 3 (a) of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, the Holy See and Switzerland, the two non-Member States which were invited to nominate judges for the Trial Chambers of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, shall participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. On this occasion, I am happy to welcome here the representatives of the Holy See and Switzerland.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa07">Thirdly, in accordance with article 12, paragraph 5 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, the judges shall be elected for a term of four years. They will serve on a full-time basis and therefore cannot engage in any other occupation of a professional nature during their tenure. Moreover, the judges of the International Tribunal for Rwanda will take office, upon two months' notice, shortly before the commencement of trial proceedings. However, they may be convened beforehand for an extraordinary session for the purpose of adopting the rules of procedure and evidence of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa08">Finally, I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to the documents relating to the election. The memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning the election of judges of the International Tribunal for Rwanda is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-893.pdf">A/49/893</a>. The list of candidates for judges of the Trial Chambers of the International Tribunal for Rwanda is to be found in paragraph 8 of document <a href="../pdf/A-49-893.pdf">A/49/893</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa09">The curricula vitae of the candidates are found in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-894.pdf">A/49/894</a>. In that connection, I wish to direct the Assembly's attention to the provision of article 12, paragraph 1 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, which reads as follows:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa10">"The judges shall be persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices. In the overall composition of the Chambers due account shall be taken of the experience of the judges in criminal law, international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law." (<i>S/1994/1168, annex, article 12, para. 1</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa11">As delegates know, the election of judges will take place in accordance with the relevant provisions of article 12 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa12">Furthermore, given the similar nature of the election of judges of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the Trial Chambers of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, the Secretary-General suggests in his memorandum that the General Assembly proceed in the same manner as it did in the election of the judges of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa13">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to that suggestion?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa14">I hear no objection.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa01">In accordance with article 12, subparagraph 3 (d) of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, the candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the non-Member States maintaining permanent observer missions at United Nations Headquarters will be declared elected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa02">The practice of the United Nations has always been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they take part in the voting. The electors, for this purpose, are all 185 Member States and two non-Member States -- the Holy See and Switzerland. Accordingly, 94 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of electing judges of the Trial Chambers of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa03">If, in the first ballot, fewer than the required number of candidates obtain an absolute majority, there will be a second ballot, possibly to be followed by other rounds of balloting until the required number of candidates have obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa04">Following the practice in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, the Secretary-General suggests in his memorandum that, after the first ballot, other rounds of balloting should be unrestricted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk02-pa05">He suggested also that, in accordance with the practice followed in the elections of the judges of the International Court of Justice, if more than the required number of candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot, all candidates will be included in a second ballot and balloting will continue until the exact number of candidates required, and no more, have obtained an absolute majority.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk05-pa02">The Holy See followed with anguish and alarm the events that covered Rwanda in blood last year. On many occasions, His Holiness Pope John Paul II has deplored the mindless violence and called for an end to the massacres, which were sometimes even committed in churches, where innocent, unarmed people thought they had found sanctuary.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk05-pa03">The Holy See approved of the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which is an expression of the international community's commitment to fighting violations of human rights, and it expressed its support by making a symbolic contribution to the special fund established by the Secretary-General to finance the activities of the Tribunal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk05-pa04">The Holy See appreciates the invitation from the United Nations to join in the appointment of the judges of the Tribunal. None the less, considering its special position and special role in the community of nations, the Holy See does not intend to take active part in choosing the people who will exercise these functions. Consequently, its delegation will abstain in the voting. The General Assembly will recall that the Holy See took the same position when the judges of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia were elected in September 1993.</div>
