	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1995-209.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/209</a>, which contains a note dated 20 March 1995 by the Secretary-General concerning the date of an election to fill a vacancy in the International Court of Justice. The note explains the need for the item on our agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">The resignation of Sir Robert Jennings, which will take effect on 10 July 1995, will create a vacancy in the International Court of Justice that will have to be filled. Sir Robert Jennings was President of the Court from 1991 to 1994 and sat as a member during two Chamber cases: the Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute between El Salvador and Honduras, Nicaragua intervening, from 1986 to 1992; and Elettronica Sicula S.p.A, from 1987 to 1989. He has been a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration since 1982 and a sometime legal consultant to a number of Governments. Sir Robert Jennings is the author of various books and former editor of several law journals, including the International and Comparative Law Quarterly -- from 1957 to 1959 -- and the British Yearbook of International Law, in 1959.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Sir Robert Jennings was elected a member of the International Court of Justice on 6 February 1982. He was re-elected, as from 6 February 1991, for a further period of nine years. His current term of office would have expired on 5 February 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">Under Article 14 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, the Security Council shall fix the date for the election to fill the vacancy in the Court. As agreed during our prior consultations on this matter, the election is to take place on 12 July 1995 at a meeting of the Security Council and at a meeting of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">Members of the Council also have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1995-213.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/213</a>, which contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">May I take it that the Council is ready to proceed to a decision on the draft resolution?</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">In the light of consultations which I have held, it is my understanding that the Security Council is ready to adopt the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1995-213.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/213</a> without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">The draft resolution has been adopted as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-980(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 980 (1995)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
