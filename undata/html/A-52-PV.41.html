	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">This afternoon the General Assembly will continue with the election of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">As members will recall, when the 40th plenary meeting was adjourned earlier today there still remained to be filled two seats from among the Asian States, one seat from among the Eastern European States and one seat from among the Latin American and Caribbean States.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">I call on the representative of Georgia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Volski</span> <span class="nation">Georgia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">I take this opportunity to extend the warmest words of gratitude to those delegations that advocated Georgia's membership of the Economic and Social Council and supported us to the very end. I would like also to congratulate warmly all those already elected to that important body, among them the delegation of Belarus from our regional group.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">Under the circumstances, and in order to facilitate the course of the election, the Georgian delegation has decided to withdraw its candidature. Once again, let me thank those who supported us, and extend our best wishes for success to the delegation of Poland.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk05">

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Khalifa</span> <span class="nation">Qatar</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">As members know, Qatar is among the candidates for membership of the Economic and Social Council. My country attaches great importance to occupying one of the seats allocated to the Asian States in order to represent our region. We recall that all countries large and small are eligible to stand for seats on the Economic and Social Council, something we have seen with respect to the African States and something which deserves the greatest respect and recognition from my country and its regional group.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">In view of our belief in the importance of representation for the Asian group and in view of the fact that Oman is among the candidates from that group, my delegation has decided to withdraw its candidature in favour of that of our sister State of Oman. I thank all those delegations that have supported our candidature throughout the process.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">In accordance with the rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to a restricted ballot, taking into account the statements made by the representatives of Georgia and of Qatar.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">In accordance with the rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to the third round of balloting, by secret ballot, for the remaining seats. This third round of balloting shall be restricted to those States which were not elected but which obtained the largest number of votes in the previous ballot, and which have maintained their candidature: from among the Asian States, India, Malaysia and Oman; from among the Eastern European States, Poland; and from among the Latin America and Caribbean States, Guatemala and Peru.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">Ballot papers marked "B", "C" and "D" will now be distributed. May I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers the names of the States for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers marked "B", for the Asian States, will be declared invalid if they contain the name of a State other than India, Malaysia or Oman, as well as if they contain the names of more than two States. Ballot papers marked "C", for the Eastern European States, will be declared invalid if they contain the name of a State other than Poland, as well as if they contain the names of more than one State.
