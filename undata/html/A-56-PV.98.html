	Mr. Ovia (Papua New Guinea)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa01">I would like to make some general comments on the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, under agenda item 18.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa02">The report in document <a href="../pdf/A-56-894.pdf">A/56/894</a> contains a draft resolution on East Timor. In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Special Committee of 24 for their support. For the information of the General Assembly, this draft resolution was initiated by the former Permanent Representative of Papua New Guinea, Ambassador Peter Donigi.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa03">I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our close neighbours, the Republic of Indonesia and the former administrating Power, Portugal, for their cooperation and understanding in agreeing to the text before us today. The text is a consensus one, and it is now the text of the Chairman of the Special Committee on Decolonization. We in the Assembly all look forward to the next stage that East Timor will embark on after today, and more formally on 20 May. After independence, we hope to welcome it into our midst as one of our very own -- an equal and sovereign Member State.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa04">The draft resolution is, in large part, procedural in nature, but I would like to point out a number of salient and substantive facts and implications as we, as an active member of the Committee of 24, see them. For my delegation, the draft resolution before us today sends a very clear signal about three very important aspects.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa05">First of all, as all of the members of the Committee of 24 will agree, the draft resolution, after it has been adopted by the General Assembly today, will end the mandate of the Special Committee over one of the remaining 17 Non-Self Governing Territories. All of us in the Assembly are well aware that the Committee of 24 has been seized of this matter for at least the past two decades, if not longer, although in recent times the Security Council became seized of the matter and arranged for a Special Representative of the Secretary-General to administer the Territory. The Committee's mandate, however, was preserved, and it continued to receive petitions and to arrange participation by representatives of the Territory at its annual meetings and seminars.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa06">Secondly, this draft resolution serves to send a very strong message to all administering Powers that there is a transparent process by which all Territories on the United Nations list under the Special Committee must be dealt with, and that no administering Power may pass its own legislation or do as it pleases with any Territory or group of Territories, whatever its physical size or population, political, economic, social and historical circumstances.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa07">Thirdly, the transparent process involves the development of work programmes on a case-by-case basis for each Territory and involves the Committee in overseeing the proper administration of each Territory up to and including the date of its removal from the United Nations list.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa08">Accordingly, although the draft resolution on East Timor appears to be procedural, it has substantive implications in respect of the mandate of the Special Committee. The implication is that the administering Power cannot bypass the Special Committee by transferring or attempting to deal with the Territory concerned without the involvement of the Committee. It also shows that the Committee is serious and has in place a transparent process for dealing with each Territory.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa09">For these reasons, over the past several years Papua New Guinea has been advocating that a specific programme of work for each Territory be developed, in close collaboration and cooperation with the Committee of 24, the administering Powers and the peoples of the Territory. Such a programme of work must take account of all of the issues and the circumstances pertaining to each of them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa10">In this regard, therefore, the Committee has mandated the delegations of Antigua and Barbuda and Papua New Guinea to lead informal discussions with the people of the Territories and the administering Powers to arrive at possible elements for work programmes for the small Territories in both the Caribbean and Pacific regions. The Papua New Guinea delegation, together with all interested delegations, has commenced discussions with the administering Powers in respect to developing work programmes for Tokelau Islands, American Samoa and Pitcairn Island in the Pacific region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa11">We had one such meeting with the Ulu O Tokelau -- the head of Tokelau -- the New Zealand Administrator and government officials last year. We are very grateful that Tokelau Islands and its administering Power, New Zealand, are moving in unison in this direction, and hopefully a work programme will be finalized very soon.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa12">We also met with the Government of the United States last year and on 15 March this year, albeit at an informal level. The United States Administration has taken on board the draft work programme and will soon make suggestions to the Special Committee with regard to the Territory of American Samoa.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa13">We have also made initial contact with the Government of the United Kingdom with regard to Pitcairn Island and are awaiting a response.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa14">I would therefore like to conclude my remarks by calling once again on all administering Powers, especially the larger ones -- the United States, the United Kingdom and France -- to continue to cooperate fully with the Special Committee in all our endeavours to complete our work in this our second decade.</div>
