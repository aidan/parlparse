<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ovia</span> <span class="nation">Papua New Guinea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">I would like to make some general comments on the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, under agenda item 18.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">The report in <a href="../pdf/A-56-894.pdf" class="pdf">document A/56/894</a> contains a draft resolution on East Timor. In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Special Committee of 24 for their support. For the information of the General Assembly, this draft resolution was initiated by the former Permanent Representative of Papua New Guinea, Ambassador Peter Donigi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our close neighbours, the Republic of Indonesia and the former administrating Power, Portugal, for their cooperation and understanding in agreeing to the text before us today. The text is a consensus one, and it is now the text of the Chairman of the Special Committee on Decolonization. We in the Assembly all look forward to the next stage that East Timor will embark on after today, and more formally on 20 May. After independence, we hope to welcome it into our midst as one of our very own -- an equal and sovereign Member State.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa04">The draft resolution is, in large part, procedural in nature, but I would like to point out a number of salient and substantive facts and implications as we, as an active member of the Committee of 24, see them. For my delegation, the draft resolution before us today sends a very clear signal about three very important aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa05">First of all, as all of the members of the Committee of 24 will agree, the draft resolution, after it has been adopted by the General Assembly today, will end the mandate of the Special Committee over one of the remaining 17 Non-Self Governing Territories. All of us in the Assembly are well aware that the Committee of 24 has been seized of this matter for at least the past two decades, if not longer, although in recent times the Security Council became seized of the matter and arranged for a Special Representative of the Secretary-General to administer the Territory. The Committee's mandate, however, was preserved, and it continued to receive petitions and to arrange participation by representatives of the Territory at its annual meetings and seminars.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa06">Secondly, this draft resolution serves to send a very strong message to all administering Powers that there is a transparent process by which all Territories on the United Nations list under the Special Committee must be dealt with, and that no administering Power may pass its own legislation or do as it pleases with any Territory or group of Territories, whatever its physical size or population, political, economic, social and historical circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa07">Thirdly, the transparent process involves the development of work programmes on a case-by-case basis for each Territory and involves the Committee in overseeing the proper administration of each Territory up to and including the date of its removal from the United Nations list.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa08">Accordingly, although the draft resolution on East Timor appears to be procedural, it has substantive implications in respect of the mandate of the Special Committee. The implication is that the administering Power cannot bypass the Special Committee by transferring or attempting to deal with the Territory concerned without the involvement of the Committee. It also shows that the Committee is serious and has in place a transparent process for dealing with each Territory.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa09">For these reasons, over the past several years Papua New Guinea has been advocating that a specific programme of work for each Territory be developed, in close collaboration and cooperation with the Committee of 24, the administering Powers and the peoples of the Territory. Such a programme of work must take account of all of the issues and the circumstances pertaining to each of them.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa10">In this regard, therefore, the Committee has mandated the delegations of Antigua and Barbuda and Papua New Guinea to lead informal discussions with the people of the Territories and the administering Powers to arrive at possible elements for work programmes for the small Territories in both the Caribbean and Pacific regions. The Papua New Guinea delegation, together with all interested delegations, has commenced discussions with the administering Powers in respect to developing work programmes for Tokelau Islands, American Samoa and Pitcairn Island in the Pacific region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa11">We had one such meeting with the Ulu O Tokelau -- the head of Tokelau -- the New Zealand Administrator and government officials last year. We are very grateful that Tokelau Islands and its administering Power, New Zealand, are moving in unison in this direction, and hopefully a work programme will be finalized very soon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa12">We also met with the Government of the United States last year and on 15 March this year, albeit at an informal level. The United States Administration has taken on board the draft work programme and will soon make suggestions to the Special Committee with regard to the Territory of American Samoa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa13">We have also made initial contact with the Government of the United Kingdom with regard to Pitcairn Island and are awaiting a response.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa14">I would therefore like to conclude my remarks by calling once again on all administering Powers, especially the larger ones -- the United States, the United Kingdom and France -- to continue to cooperate fully with the Special Committee in all our endeavours to complete our work in this our second decade.</p>

The co-chairpersons shall be heads of State or Government and shall be selected from the five regional groups. The sixth co-chairperson, who shall be the head of State of the country of the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, will co-chair round table 3.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa02">With regard to the sixth co-chairperson, I have been informed that the President of the Republic of Korea will not be able to attend the special session on children. In the light of this development, consultations were held with the chairmen of the regional groups regarding the replacement of the sixth co-chairperson.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa03">I should like to inform members that it has been agreed that the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal will be the replacement as the sixth co-chairperson to co-chair round table 3.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa02">The adoption of draft decision <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.77.pdf" class="pdf">A/56/L.77</a> would give rise to a requirement for expenditure in the amount of $328,100 in respect of the scheduling of meetings on the weekend of 14 and 15 September 2002.
