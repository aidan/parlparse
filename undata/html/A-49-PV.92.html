	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk03-pa01">It is with deep regret that I must inform the Assembly of the death yesterday of Mr. Bradford Morse at his home in Naples, Florida.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk03-pa02">Mr. Morse's association with the United Nations was one of extraordinary distinction. Mr. Morse was Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme from 1976 to 1986. Prior to that appointment Mr. Morse was Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs from 1972 to 1976, after having served six terms as a member of the House of Representatives of the United States of America.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk03-pa03">His dedication and devotion to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to the United Nations Development Programme as a valuable instrument for economic development will never be forgotten.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk03-pa04">All who had the privilege and pleasure of knowing Mr. Morse will remember his warm human qualities, his compassion and his dynamic energy.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk03-pa05">On behalf of the General Assembly, I should like to request the representative of the United States of America to transmit to the Government of the United States of America and to the family of Mr. Morse our expressions of profound sympathy.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk03-pa06">I now ask representatives to stand and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of Mr. Bradford Morse.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk06-pa01">My country and the United Nations suffered a huge loss yesterday in the passing away of Bradford Morse. In remembering him this afternoon, we should remember his compassion and his dedication to bettering the lives of people all over the world.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk06-pa02">Bradford Morse served the United Nations and the international community for 14 years, from 1972 to 1986, first as Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs, and then as Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme. His career was guided by the fervent desire to use the institutions of the United Nations to mobilize and deliver humanitarian and economic assistance to persons in need throughout the world.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk06-pa03">It is no exaggeration to state that millions of people throughout the world are in Mr. Morse's debt. He has bequeathed to us his successors in this Organization a powerful and important legacy -- a United Nations which effectively brings its resources to bear on the pressing problems that affect people, nations and the international community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg001-bk06-pa04">We must all do our utmost to continue and develop that legacy to meet the challenges that we face today and the new challenges that we shall face in the future. The inspiration of Mr. Morse's example will be a powerful motivation to that end.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk02-pa01">I call on the representative of Zambia, Chairman of the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia, to introduce the Committee's final report.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Kasanda</span><span class="nation">Zambia</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa01">It is my distinct honour and privilege to introduce the final report of the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia (<a href="../pdf/A-49-782.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/782</a>). Part II of the report contains details on the activities of the Fund for Namibia during the period 1991-1994. Part IV contains recommendations and conclusions and the draft resolution for consideration by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa02">As Chairman of the Trust Committee, I should like to express my sense of pride and privilege at being a part of this historic moment and of this final chapter in United Nations responsibility for Namibia. Zambia has had a long and fruitful association with the Council for Namibia as its President. Zambia has also been privileged to serve as Chairman of the Committee on the Fund for Namibia and, most recently, as Chairman of the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa03">The United Nations Council for Namibia, as the legal Administering Authority for the country until independence, had the foresight, in preparing it for independence, to use the Fund for Namibia for the purpose of supporting human resources development as the cornerstone of its nation-building efforts. Over the lifetime of the United Nations Institute for Namibia more than 1,200 students were trained, primarily for the civil service, in divisions that included development studies, magistrates' functions, public administration and international relations, teaching, secretarial studies and management.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa04">Zambia was very proud to provide the premises for the United Nations Institute for Namibia. In this respect, the President of Zambia personally presided at most special occasions, including the inauguration, and at almost all the graduation ceremonies. The Institute completed its work in 1990. Accordingly, it is recommended that the Fund for Namibia and the Institute for Namibia Account be closed.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa05">The crowning success in the discharge of the responsibility of the United Nations for Namibia was the elections that were supervised and controlled by the Organization, culminating in Namibia's independence in 1990. The preparations leading up to independence were a great credit to Member States, the Namibian people and the United Nations Secretariat, as well as to United Nations executing and financing agencies, which, in a partnership perhaps unique in the history of the Organization, laboured to lay the groundwork through development projects financed primarily under the Nationhood Programme Account of the United Nations Fund for Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa06">Since its inception in 1979, the Nationhood Programme has comprised more than 100 training and research projects. In addition to capacity-building through formal and non-formal training, primarily in the front-line States, the Nationhood Programme supported institution-building projects, such as the Technical Secondary School in the Congo, the Vocational Training Centre in Angola, the Agricultural Training School in Zambia and the Namibia Enrolled Nurses Training School in Angola. The institutions flourished, in spite of their wartime setting, with virtually full-time Namibian administration. The multiplier effect of training a corps of people to run the country and of providing excellent experience in the development and administration of their own institutions was a credit to the United Nations Council for Namibia and the Fund, to the donors and to the Member States that fostered the development of these institutions and projects.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa07">These projects and programmes are a model of partnership and cooperation, to the credit of all of us in the global community. As we have recommended in our report, the one remaining student under the Nationhood Programme will this month complete his studies in the field of mining. We have also approved one project deficit payment.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa08">The remaining student funded under the General Account, which was primarily a scholarship programme for formal training abroad, will, as recommended by the Trust Committee, complete his studies in 1996, under the able administration of the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa of the Department of Development Support and Management Services.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa09">We are convinced that the cornerstone laid through the training of thousands of Namibians under these three Accounts of the United Nations Fund for Namibia will serve to consolidate the foundations of democracy and the process of healing now under way in Namibia. We extend our best wishes to the Government and people of Namibia for continued success in this regard.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa10">We commend to the Assembly, for its consideration and unanimous adoption, the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-782.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/782</a>. We are pleased to commend, in addition to provisions of the operative paragraphs that I have already highlighted, the closure of the Trust Fund and the transfer of its assets to the Government of Namibia to be utilized for the purposes for which they were given -- namely, the education of Namibians.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa11">Finally, we are pleased, upon completion of our mandate, to recommend the dissolution of the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg002-bk03-pa12">In conclusion, I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the members of the Trust Committee for their dedication and commitment. I should like, on their behalf and on my own behalf, to express gratitude to all Member States for their invaluable support and for their contributions to the successful completion of our mandate. We also commend the generous support, in the form of financial and material contributions, extended to the United Nations Fund for Namibia by many Member States. The Secretary-General and the United Nations Secretariat, as well as the relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, also deserve our deep appreciation.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa01">Before addressing the item on our agenda, I would like, on behalf of the Government, the people and the delegation of Namibia, to express heartfelt condolences to the delegation of the United States and to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) family on the loss of the former Administrator of the UNDP, Mr. Bradford Morse. I personally recall the close relations between Mr. Morse, when he was Administrator of the UNDP, and the former Commissioners for Namibia, especially the late Sean McBride. As we address the question of the United Nations Fund for Namibia, I regret to learn that Mr. Morse has left us, because when he created the Indicative Planning Figure for Namibia he was very supportive. Please accept our condolences.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa02">When my colleague the Honourable Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, addressed the Assembly on 6 October 1994, he extended Namibia's best wishes to you, Mr. President. Namibia is indeed proud that an illustrious son of Africa is presiding over our world body at its forty-ninth session. It is therefore my honour and privilege to bring to you, and through you, to other representatives, warm greetings and salutations from the Government and the people of Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa03">The Namibian delegation is particularly grateful to you, Mr. President, and to the General Committee for agreeing to Namibia's request to inscribe on the agenda of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session agenda item 160, "United Nations Fund for Namibia", even at this late hour.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa04">His Excellency Mr. Peter Kasanda, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the Republic of Zambia to the United Nations and Chairperson of the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia, very ably introduced the final report on the Fund, on behalf of the Trust Committee. I shall therefore confine myself to highlighting some of the salient achievements of the Fund in support of the liberation and nationhood of Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa05">When this body, on 27 October 1966, terminated South Africa's mandate to rule Namibia, it assumed a noble responsibility to lead the people of Namibia to nationhood. It was against this background that, by resolution 2248 (S-V) of 19 May 1967, the General Assembly established the United Nations Council for Namibia and the Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Namibia. By resolution 2679 (XXV) of 9 December 1970, the General Assembly established the United Nations Fund for Namibia. Through resolution 3112 (XXVIII) of 12 December 1973, the Assembly appointed the United Nations Council for Namibia trustee of the Fund. As the activities of the Council for Namibia expanded and started to provide education and training to the Namibians, the Assembly launched the Nationhood Programme for Namibia by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-31-153.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 31/153</a> of 20 December 1976. In addition, by resolution 3296 (XXIX) of 13 December 1974, the General Assembly adopted the plan for the establishment of the United Nations Institute for Namibia at Lusaka, in Zambia. Thus, through the vigorous fund-raising activities of the Council for Namibia, three distinct Funds were established -- the General Account Fund, the Nationhood Programme Fund and the Fund for the United Nations Institute for Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa06">The General Account Fund provided individual scholarships to Namibians, met the social and medical needs of students and trainees and supported specially targeted educational projects, such as the Namibian Secondary Technical School, which was located in Congo. The Fund also assisted Namibians to attend international meetings pertaining to Namibia. At Namibia's independence, some 255 students were still pursuing their studies in various fields and at different educational levels. Today all but one have completed their studies and returned to Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa07">The Nationhood Programme was a comprehensive developmental programme focusing on training and research projects. By June 1989 the total value of the Programme amounted to $28,690,360. Some 42 projects, costing $12,223,065, were carried out from 1979 to 1989. Another 43 projects, valued at $16,464,295, were under way by June 1989. More than 1,700 students were trained through the Nationhood Programme and the General Account programme.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa08">The United Nations Institute for Namibia was opened in Lusaka on 26 August 1976. Before its dissolution in September 1990 it had trained 1,456 Namibians in the fields of administration, teacher education, law, international relations and secretarial skills.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa09">The impact of the educational and training programmes of the United Nations Fund for Namibia is very visible today. Beneficiaries of these training programmes are to be found at the policy, programme and management level of the Government of the Republic of Namibia. A number of Government Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and Ambassadors, including our current Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, were also trained through these programmes.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa10">It may be said, therefore, that the past two decades have been years of combined international efforts to prepare Namibians for their nationhood. These efforts have been critical to human-resource development for a free and democratic Namibia. Apartheid colonial policies excluded the African majority from meaningful education and decision-making responsibilities. At independence, the new Government had to start building democracy on the ashes of apartheid minority misrule. Leaders trained abroad brought back skills and experience from outside Namibia. Many of those cadres are the ones that benefited from the education and training programmes of the United Nations Fund for Namibia. The Assembly has therefore fulfilled the responsibility it assumed under resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966, when it accepted direct responsibility for preparing the people of Namibia for their national independence and nationhood.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa11">The Fund was able to take off and grow thanks only to the generous annual contributions of many countries, small and large, rich and poor, developing and developed. Contributions to the Fund demonstrated a collective commitment by the international community to freedom, democracy, human rights and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as set out in resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa12">The General Assembly itself, besides funding the activities of the Council for Namibia and the Office of the Commissioner for Namibia, subventionized part of the Fund for Namibia on an annual basis. The United Nations Development Programme established the Indicative Planning Figure for Namibia, through which funds were allocated to the Fund for Namibia. Other agencies of the United Nations system supported the activities of the Fund through such gestures as an overhead costs waiver, funding for specific activities, training and accepting Namibians for experiential attachments and training.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa13">The United Nations Council for Namibia's Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia worked hard to campaign for support for the Fund. Under the Chairmanship of Zambia, with Venezuela as Rapporteur, the Fund Committee inspired international confidence in the Fund. It is for this reason that the Fund has received generous contributions for the past 20 years.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa14">The Office of the Commissioner for Namibia was pivotal in the administration of the Fund's identification of the training and educational needs of Namibia and in the implementation of various projects. Through the dynamism of the former Commissioner for Namibia, the late Mr. Sean McBride, the Fund for Namibia and the United Nations Institute for Namibia gained international recognition, support and acknowledgement. The former United Nations Commissioner for Namibia, Mr. Marti Ahtisaari, who is now President of Finland, expanded the Fund's activities by implementing a programme for the comprehensive development of Namibian human resources, policy planning and research through the United Nations Nationhood Programme for Namibia. Ambassador Mishra continued along the same path. Staff members of the United Nations Council for Namibia and the Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Namibia worked very hard to identify training institutions, liaise with receiving Governments and monitor the progress of students.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa15">Many Governments and national institutions all over the world received students from Namibia and provided educational opportunities under the Fund's programmes. Special recognition should be accorded to the Republic of Zambia, which provided leadership to the United Nations Council for Namibia and to the Fund Committee. Zambia also hosted a variety of training programmes under the Fund, including the United Nations Institute for Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa16">The Republic of Angola hosted the United Nations Vocational Training Centre for Namibia. It also provided the logistics for the recruitment of potential trainees under the Fund's projects.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa17">The Republic of the Congo housed the Namibian Secondary Technical School, which provided general secondary education to young exiled Namibians. The Fund augmented the resources of the Centre through support to Namibian employees of the school.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa18">The Republic of Cuba hosted two Namibian schools which housed the young people who survived the Cassinga massacre in Angola. The Fund contributed by providing instructional materials in English and other classroom equipment.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa19">As we gather here today to close down the United Nations Fund for Namibia and to transfer the net residual assets of the Fund to the Government of the Republic of Namibia, I should like, on behalf of the Government and the people of Namibia, to thank the United Nations for its invaluable contribution to the freedom, independence and, above all, the nationhood of Namibia. The United Nations efforts to achieve the development of Namibia stand out as a shining example of international understanding, cooperation and collaboration.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa20">As we bring to an end the special relations between the United Nations and the Republic of Namibia and the special programmes, we may be tempted to proclaim that we are closing a chapter. Indeed, we are not; we are merely turning a new page in our development efforts. Although political apartheid has been buried, the impacts of its policies on our society are still very much in evidence. For example, the massive inequities in the distribution of resources to various sectors of our community are embarrassing features of our democracy.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa21">It is against that background that our Government is spending half of the annual national budget on social sectors, with education claiming 25 per cent of the budget, or 12 per cent of the gross domestic product. The goal is to reduce inequities in the allocation of resources between the formerly disadvantaged communities and the privileged sectors of our population, between urban and rural areas, between women and men. This is a challenging task, which requires all the support and encouragement of the international community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa22">Namibia's democracy is faced with challenges of unequal wealth distribution, youth unemployment, social development and economic revitalization. In this regard, the Government is about to complete the first National Development Plan, whose goal is to address the social and economic distortions of the apartheid legacy. The Government, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme, is planning to organize a second donors conference for the reconstruction of Namibia. We plead for sympathy, support and understanding from the international community in this regard.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa23">The Government of the Republic of Namibia is grateful to note that net residual funds and assets in excess of $4 million will be transferred to the Government of the Republic of Namibia. The Government has already taken a decision to invest those funds in safe investment portfolios from which regular modest interest will be earned and be earmarked to provide scholarships for training abroad in fields of special developmental interest to Namibia. Such money will only target fields of study which are not available in Namibia. We believe that this is the best way to thank the various countries that have contributed so generously to the United Nations Fund for Namibia over the past 20 years. An education endowment fund will be created to manage this money.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg003-bk02-pa24">As we approach the festive season, my delegation is gratified to take back to the Namibian people your season's greetings, Mr. President.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg006-bk03-pa01">My delegation is delighted to extend its congratulations to the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia on the successful completion of its work. At this important moment in the political development of Namibia, all those who have worked tirelessly to ensure the realization of the mandate of the Trust Committee deserve special commendation. It is important to emphasize that, although Namibia attained its independence in 1990, the work of the Trust Committee has continued, especially during the country's initial period of fundamental socio-economic transformation. The Namibia Fund has demonstrated its capacity to render direct assistance to individual Namibians cost-effectively. It has over the years ensured the exemplary measure of creating a future through education and training for a lot of disadvantaged Namibians.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg006-bk03-pa02">With Namibia's attainment of independence, the challenges facing its new Government were first and foremost those of addressing the enormous socio-economic imbalance resulting from decades of colonialism and apartheid. My country has remained steadfast in identifying fully with the needs and aspirations of this sister African country. It is for this reason, <i>inter alia</i>, that we have continued to support the noble ideals of the Namibia Fund. In the same vein, we fully support the recommendation of the Trust Committee that the available balance of funds resulting from the closure of the three Accounts of the United Nations Fund for Namibia be transferred to the Government of Namibia for use in accordance with the original purpose of the Fund. We also urge the international community to continue to render the necessary financial and economic assistance to Namibia and other developing countries so as to ensure their sustained growth and development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg006-bk03-pa03">As the development of human resources is an important aspect of any society and the most durable legacy any Government can bequeath to its citizenry, my delegation believes that national Governments have the responsibility to develop strategies aimed at achieving the desired goal of enhancing the living conditions of their people. Nevertheless, the support and assistance of the international community in this regard become all the more relevant. While we feel confident that the Namibian Government will continue to uphold the ideals for which the Namibia Fund was established in the first place, the international community -- and in particular the United Nations, which has been closely involved in the affairs of that country over the years -- should continue to provide valuable assistance as the country undertakes its programmes of reconstruction and progressive development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg006-bk03-pa04">It is not often that the United Nations meets to say "Mission accomplished", but as we adopt the present draft resolution we shall be saying just that.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg006-bk04-pa01">First of all, may I join in the tribute that has just been paid by the General Assembly to Mr. Bradford Morse of the United States, who served the United Nations well in several capacities.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg006-bk04-pa02">The United Nations Fund for Namibia was established in 1970 to provide assistance to the people of Namibia during their struggle for independence. Today marks an important occasion, for the Fund has fulfilled its mandate in an exemplary manner.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg006-bk04-pa03">The General Assembly decided in 1990, after Namibia's accession to independence, to continue the Fund to ensure the orderly completion of all activities it had undertaken until then. This decision stands vindicated by the success achieved by the Fund in continuing educational assistance to Namibians through its General Account, the Nationhood Programme Account and the United Nations Institute for Namibia Account. An indication of the contribution made by the Fund to the Namibian struggle for independence can be had, <i>inter alia</i>, from the number of Namibian students who have benefited from it since its inception. We are informed that over 5,000 Namibian students and trainees have been provided assistance from the Fund to date. An amount of approximately $60 million has been disbursed. India is proud to have contributed to this effort.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg006-bk04-pa04">India's support for the Namibian struggle for independence, through bilateral and international channels alike, is on record. Our participation in international efforts such as the Council for Namibia and the Fund for Namibia, in addition to our bilateral assistance to the South West Africa People's Organization, was a reflection of our duty to assist the Namibian people in their just struggle for independence. It is this sense of duty which impelled us to associate ourselves with the Council for Namibia from its very inception and subsequently with the Fund for Namibia and the Trust Committee for the Fund for Namibia, which was established after the dissolution of the Council for Namibia in 1990. An eminent Indian diplomat, Ambassador B. C. Mishra, has also served as the Commissioner for Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg006-bk04-pa05">As I indicated earlier, the mandate of the Fund for Namibia and the Trust Committee for the Fund stands fulfilled. We therefore support the dissolution of the Trust Committee. Furthermore, we are in agreement with the recommendation that the remaining assets of the Fund be transferred to the Government of Namibia for the further education of Namibians. We consider this gesture to be a symbol of the commitment of the United Nations to the continuing efforts of the Government of Namibia for the economic and social betterment of its people. The Government of Namibia deserves our continued support in these efforts, and my Government stands ready to do what it can to lend it such support.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk01-pa01">I should like at the outset to convey my delegation's sincere condolences over the sad demise of Mr. Bradford Morse, the former Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk01-pa02">Today, as this body meets to dissolve the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia, it is indeed fitting to remember that this act is directly linked with Namibia's independence. The world community resolved to bring about the independence of Namibia through a genuine exercise of the inalienable right to self-determination of the Namibian people. We can recall with justifiable pride that the heroic struggle of the Namibian people and the consistent support of the international community culminated in the independence of Namibia in March 1990. This historic development is a shining example of the United Nations role in emancipating peoples from the shackles of colonialism.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk01-pa03">Pakistan, along with several other freedom-loving countries, was in the forefront of championing the cause of the right to self-determination of the Namibian people. Its success in Namibia added a glorious chapter to the achievements of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk01-pa04">Today we gather to dissolve the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia. We would like to pay a tribute to all those countries that have sustained these efforts with dedication, courage and financial contributions. The decision that we are going to take also demonstrates maturity in the functioning of the Organization, in that when specific tasks have been performed satisfactorily, we can also dismantle the organizational set-up aimed at addressing the situation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk01-pa05">This is a delicate psychological moment for the Namibian people. The dissolution of the Committee should in no way be construed as signalling the discontinuation of international assistance to them. The scars of subjugation and alien administration take decades to heal. This is a time when the Namibian people need reassurance in the form of continued assistance from the international community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk01-pa06">Pakistan itself is a developing country, undergoing the painful process of transition from underdevelopment to development. However, throughout Pakistan's short history we have never forgotten the requirements of our brothers in Africa, particularly the people of Namibia. In addition to bilateral assistance programmes, the Government of Pakistan launched a five-year Technical Assistance Programme for Africa. The Programme, commonly known as the Special Technical Assistance Programme, provides cost-free training programmes for African students and professionals in the fields of administration, agriculture, aviation, banking, diplomacy, pharmacy, engineering, oceanography, broadcasting, power generation, port management and postal and railway services. Hundreds of scholarships are offered to African students to study in Pakistan institutions and universities. We are pleased to note that Namibian students and professionals have participated in these programmes. We hope that our cooperation with Namibia in this field will grow in the years to come.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, I should once again like to congratulate the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia on its important accomplishments. I should also like to convey the best wishes of the Government and people of Pakistan to the brotherly people of Namibia.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Cissé</span><span class="nation">Senegal</span><span class="language">French</span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk02-pa01">It was with great sadness that I learned this morning of the death of Mr. Bradford Morse yesterday at his home in Naples, Florida. I immediately informed the Government of Senegal of his passing, because Bradford Morse was always a friend of Senegal, and of Africa as a whole, during his years in Congress and the time when he occupied important posts of considerable responsibility in the United Nations. Bradford Morse was very familiar with Senegal, where his work was deeply appreciated, and his generosity and nobility of heart and spirit won him great esteem in my country. On behalf of the Government of Senegal, and on my own behalf, I should like solemnly to pay tribute to this illustrious personage and to convey deep condolences to the United States Government, his widow, his three children and all the other members of his family.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk02-pa02">Although 24 years ago there was much uncertainty about Namibia's acceding to independence, the international community, which was firmly resolved to achieve that objective, was already making plans to prepare the citizens of Namibia to take their future into their own hands when the time was ripe.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk02-pa03">To that end, the international community created the United Nations Fund for Namibia, with a General Account, a Nationhood Programme Account and an Account for the Institute for Namibia. As a member of the Governing Council of the Fund, Senegal can state today with pride and satisfaction that it has effectively carried out its task.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk02-pa04">The General Account made it possible to grant scholarships to 80 students from Namibia. They have all completed their studies, with the exception of one, whose programme will be completed in 1996. The Account for the Institute for Namibia ceased functioning in 1990 after having initiated a number of interesting training programmes. The Nationhood Programme Account financed 14 projects, only three of which need additional funding.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk02-pa05">These few examples, culled from so many others in the report of the Secretary-General, bear eloquent testimony to the important achievements of the United Nations Fund for Namibia. I should therefore like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the Chairman and the members of the Governing Council of the Fund on the rigour, the efficiency and the wisdom with which they managed the Fund, thus making possible these tangible and satisfactory results.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk02-pa06">I should also like to extend my very sincere thanks to the donor countries, and my warm congratulations to the Secretary-General and the Secretariat on having provided valuable financial support and high-calibre technical assistance to the Fund.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk02-pa07">This act of solidarity is all the more significant today because the international community, which is determined to continue to assist Namibia in its efforts for national reconstruction, envisages the transfer of these three Fund Accounts to the Government of that friendly and fraternal country to enable it to continue its work. This very wise decision, which we would particularly like to welcome, demonstrates -- if that were necessary -- the international community's firm commitment to continuing its support for the strengthening of the bases of the new Namibian nation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg007-bk02-pa08">For all those reasons, I should like to fully associate myself with the statement made earlier by the Minister of Education and Culture of Namibia and also to reiterate the total support of the delegation of Senegal for the draft resolution entitled "United Nations Fund for Namibia". I hope that this draft resolution, whose noble goals are beyond question, will be adopted by consensus.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg008-bk01-pa01">I wish to extend cordial greetings to His Excellency Mr. Nahas Angula, Minister of Education and Culture of the Republic of Namibia. Venezuela and its delegation are pleased to see that our Organizations's long-term efforts in helping the people of Namibia have today reached another milestone, particularly since we have been members of the Council for Namibia and the soon-to-be-dissolved Trust Committee for the Fund for Namibia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg008-bk01-pa02">Since Namibia achieved its independence in 1990 and the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-44-243.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 44/243</a>, the Fund for Namibia has been able to continue its operations, ensuring, under the supervision of the Trust Committee, the successful completion of all the programmes and activities on its agenda. The final report reflects the Fund's excellent financial situation and contains the Committee's recommendation that the Fund's operations be shut down, in the light of the goals already achieved in its three operational accounts. It also recommends a transfer of the existing assets to the Government of Namibia to help it continue to carry out, through its own national institutions or any others it may deem appropriate, activities in keeping with the original purpose for which the Fund was created -- the education of Namibians.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg008-bk01-pa03">In its capacity as Vice-Chairman of the Trust Committee, the delegation of Venezuela is confident that the General Assembly will lend its full support to the recommendations contained in the report.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg008-bk01-pa04">Venezuela congratulates the people and the Government of Namibia, with which we have very close and cordial relations, on the progress achieved in their country at all levels, and we ask its representatives to convey to Namibia's authorities our best wishes for well-being and prosperity in their country and our assurances that we will continue to lend them all the support we can within our means.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg008-bk01-pa05">On this occasion our joy for Namibia's future is mixed with sadness over the death of Bradford Morse, who was so much a part of United Nations efforts to improve and equalize the lot of peoples. Thanks to successes such as the one we mark today on Namibia, his memory will always be linked with the aspirations of States that struggle for justice and social well-being.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg009-bk01-pa01">The draft resolution before us, submitted by the Trust Committee for the United Nations Fund for Namibia, will, when adopted, bring to a close an important chapter in the long process that led to the independence of Namibia and its admission to membership in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg009-bk01-pa02">The draft resolution, in its second preambular paragraph, quite appropriately recalls General Assembly resolution 2679 (XXV) of 9 December 1970, by which the Assembly established the United Nations Fund for Namibia. That resolution was originally introduced in the Fourth Committee of the Assembly by the delegation of Finland on behalf of the sponsors: Burundi, Nepal, Sierra Leone and Zambia. I should like to quote a passage from the introductory statement made at that time by the Representative of Finland. Having referred to the special responsibility of the United Nations towards Namibia, he stated that</p>
	<blockquote id="docA49PV92-pg009-bk01-pa03">"that special responsibility calls for a broad financial and economic commitment by the United Nations -- not a commitment by choice, but one that follows directly from the responsibility of the United Nations for Namibia. It is a commitment to every form of assistance and every form of guidance that we can possibly give for the benefit of the population of the Territory until its independence. Its aims would not merely be to offer financial assistance for relief or education, but to contribute to an increased feeling of nationhood and national responsibility among Namibians by providing for them education, training and other kinds of assistance in an appropriate form and environment."</blockquote>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg009-bk01-pa04">The United Nations can take pride and pleasure in stating today that it has fulfilled the special responsibility which it undertook to carry out for Namibia 24 years ago. Therefore, the General Assembly can, with full justification, now take the measures recommended in the draft resolution introduced by the Chairman of the Trust Committee, the Permanent Representative of Zambia.</p>

It has been very pleasant for me and for my country to serve as Rapporteur of the Second Committee at this very important session.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa01">It is a distinct pleasure for me to speak on behalf of the of non-aligned countries.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa02">I should like, first, to express our deepest condolences on the passing away of Mr. Bradford Morse of the United States, a former Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa03">We welcome the consensus adoption of the draft resolution entitled "Enhanced international cooperation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries", which was sponsored by Algeria on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by Indonesia on behalf of the non-aligned countries and is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-727-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/727/Add.2</a>. We should like also to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to all countries for their cooperation and support, especially during the negotiations that led to the Assembly's adoption of this draft resolution by consensus.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa04">We believe that this resolution, though falling short of our expectations, marks the beginning of a more fruitful partnership for solution of the perennial debt problem, which for too long has plagued the developing countries in particular.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa05">Given the complexity of the issue, the developing countries have for quite some time striven to achieve a comprehensive and integrated approach to the solution of their external debt problems. It is true that, as is noted in the resolution, the various ongoing approaches which have contributed to the international debt strategy that has evolved to date -- for example, the Brady Plan, the Toronto Terms and the Trinidad Terms -- have addressed important parts of the overall problem. These, together with the national efforts of the debtor countries, have resulted in an improvement in the relevant overall aggregate indicators. This is due especially to the progress achieved in Latin America.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa06">However, despite such efforts, too many countries continue to be plagued by acute debt and debt-servicing problems. The situation in Africa, for the most part, is considerably worse than it was in the early 1980s, and payment arrears continue to soar. As is noted in the fifth preambular paragraph of the resolution, this is due, <i>inter alia</i>, to the uneven development of the various approaches. In addition, as has been pointed out by the Secretary-General, there is still something lacking in such approaches, and gaps have persisted. We consider that this resolution, if fully implemented, will to some extent represent an important step towards closing such lacunae.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa07">We should have liked the resolution to contain all the provisions recommended by the non-aligned countries' ministerial meeting on debt and development, which was held in Jakarta in August 1994, and by the ministerial declaration of the eighteenth annual meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77, which was held in New York in September 1994. I refer in particular to those provisions related to the need for a</p>
	<blockquote id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa08">"once-and-for-all arrangement for settling the outstanding debt of the developing countries"</blockquote>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa09">and for a substantial reduction of all types of debt, including multilateral debt, for all categories of developing countries. We consider these to be essential elements of a global approach to the realization of an effective, comprehensive, equitable, development-oriented and durable solution to the perennial debt problem of the developing countries, particularly the poorest and most heavily indebted of them.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa10">However, we note that the resolution contains a number of positive measures. In this context, we particularly welcome the formulation of the seventh preambular paragraph, which stresses the importance of alleviating the debt and debt-servicing burdens connected with the various types of debt of many developing countries on the basis of an equitable and durable approach and, where appropriate, addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a priority.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa11">We are also gratified by operative paragraph 2, in which the Assembly recognizes that a durable solution to the debt problems of the poorest and heavily indebted developing countries suggests even more favourable terms of debt-relief measures, including a reduction of the stock of debt sufficient to enable those countries to exit from the rescheduling process and help them to resume growth and development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa12">We consider that those two provisions in the resolution essentially reflect the intent of the aforementioned recommendations of the non-aligned countries' ministerial meeting on debt and development and the ministerial declaration of the Group of 77.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa13">In addition, we are encouraged by the fact that in operative paragraph 11 the Assembly notes the high proportion of multilateral debt of a number of developing countries and invites the international financial institutions to examine proposals for tackling such problems while preserving the preferred-creditor status of those institutions, thereby ensuring their continued ability to provide concessional financing to developing countries. This provision also corresponds to one of the recommendations of the non-aligned countries and the Group of 77.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa14">Another welcome measure is the call that is made on the international community, including the relevant international institutions, to build upon the momentum generated by various recent meetings on debt issues and to address these issues in the elaboration of an agenda for development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa15">Other provisions that should be noted are those that essentially reflect an overall balanced approach to the debt problem. These include many of the essential relationships between the various factors that are central to solution of the debt problems of the developing countries -- factors that include the need to sustain global economic growth, the need to increase financial resource flows to the developing countries, as well as to promote sound macroeconomic reforms, and the need to foster an external environment conducive to development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa16">I should like to conclude by saying that we hope and trust that the various measures called for by this resolution will be implemented by all parties involved, particularly the creditors, including the multilateral financial institutions, in their efforts to assist the debtor developing countries to solve their debt problems.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg013-bk04-pa17">I am convinced that, just as the formulation and adoption of this resolution depended on a spirit of partnership and cooperation between the developed and the developing countries, so too will its effective implementation be fully achieved only through a spirit of genuine partnership.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg015-bk07-pa02">My delegation particularly welcomes the General Assembly's adoption today of the draft resolution entitled "United Nations conference on South-South cooperation". This historic decision calls for a new and fresh look at the possibility that such cooperation can contribute to a global partnership between developing and developed countries.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg015-bk07-pa03">Allow me to recall that Foreign Minister Kono, in his address to the General Assembly at the beginning of the current session last September, expressed Japan's intention to devise</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg015-bk07-pa06">In its statements on the subject, my delegation has often referred to the international Conference on African Development, held last year in Tokyo. In our view, the Conference, in drawing on the experience of East Asian countries that have worked with some success to achieve economic progress, demonstrated that the future holds promise. Following up the Conference, an Asia-Africa Forum on South-South cooperation, organized jointly by Japan and Indonesia in cooperation with the United Nations, the UNDP and the Global Coalition for Africa, was held last week in Jakarta, with great success. My delegation will soon make available to all States Members of the United Nations a report on the outcome of that gathering, which is likely to be of great value in the work to enhance South-South cooperation envisaged in the present resolution.</p>

I would also like to express my delegation's deep appreciation to all delegations for contributing towards its adoption, particularly those involved in its negotiation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg015-bk08-pa02">Obviously, South-South cooperation is not new. It has been evolving for years, and, indeed the Afro-Asian Conference, held in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955, has been credited with laying the basic philosophical foundation for promoting a sense of collective self-reliance. The non-aligned countries and the Group of 77 have continuously called for an intensification of economic and technical cooperation between the developing countries through, <i>inter alia</i>, the development of more effective means of pooling resources, expertise and experiences within the South itself. Both groups have also advocated South-South cooperation as a necessary and viable strategy for greater collective self-reliance for national, regional and global development. The dynamism introduced through such cooperation would also contribute to strengthening the world economy and restructuring international economic relations. Since its inception, therefore, South-South cooperation has served as a mechanism for injecting a sense of common responsibility for accelerating economic and technical cooperation between developing countries and for advancing international cooperation for development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg015-bk08-pa03">Today, in this era of growing interdependence, globalization and integration, the promotion of collective self-reliance for development should, in our view, also be seen in a new light. It should be seen not only as an imperative for advancing the economic growth and development of the developing countries, but also, we believe, as an indispensable factor for helping to ensure the sustained prosperity of the developed countries of the North, as well as for promoting world peace and stability. Thus, we are convinced that South-South cooperation deserves adequate international support to enable the developing countries to evolve into a genuine partnership with the developed countries for the common purpose of fostering and strengthening the global economy.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg015-bk08-pa04">This, in my opinion, can be achieved only by increasing the capacity of the developing countries to participate fully, effectively and responsibly in world economic activities for the promotion of world economic growth and sustainable development, which should result in greater prosperity for all. The positive impact of a number of economically dynamic countries in the South, especially in Asia, in helping to put a brake on the recent worldwide recession, well illustrates this point.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg015-bk08-pa05">The resolution we have just adopted provides us with an opportunity to employ greater efforts to this end, particularly if a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation is convened. We regard the opportunity provided by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-164.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 48/164</a>, which requested the Secretary-General to present the Assembly at its fiftieth session with a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South cooperation entitled "State of South-South cooperation", as representing a first step towards elaborating a new vision for strengthening South-South cooperation with the increased involvement of the developed countries and the increasing share of the burden and responsibility of the developing countries themselves. We trust that the discussions on that report will lend support to such a new vision of South-South cooperation. Furthermore, my delegation hopes that the intergovernmental meeting of experts to be held in 1995 will help pave the way towards the convening of such a South-South conference.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg015-bk08-pa06">Moreover, we ought to remind ourselves that in this case, unlike some other international conferences, we should seek to ensure that the proposed United Nations conference on South-South cooperation does not become an end in itself but is directed towards achieving a successful follow-up process and implementation. As we see it, the conference should serve as a forum for elaborating and adopting the new vision of South-South cooperation whereby the developing countries would continue to formulate, develop and strengthen their own cooperation based on their own priorities and needs, but, at the same time, it should also underscore the importance of and need for international support, cooperation and partnership in the pursuit of its successful implementation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg015-bk08-pa07">In conclusion, since Indonesia has always attached great important to the strengthening of South-South cooperation, my delegation is particularly appreciative of the efforts of those developing and developed countries that have over the years helped to promote various South-South cooperation programmes with Indonesia. We hope that such cooperation will be further enhanced in the context of the implementation of this resolution.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg018-bk01-pa04">The Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan pays equal attention to the short-term and the long-term goals of the development of the transport and transit infrastructure in Central Asia, and would welcome the international community's support and assistance both in the development of new and feasible alternative routes and in the improvement of regional transport planning, the elaboration and updating of transport- and transit-facilitating arrangements among the countries of the region and their neighbours, and their accession to the relevant international conventions in the field of transport and transit.</p>

We feel that the draft resolution represents a step towards ensuring the sustainability of marine resources. For this reason, my delegation was pleased to join with others in the adoption of draft resolution VI by consensus.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg022-bk14-pa02">We would like to associate ourselves with the views expressed on this draft resolution by the delegations of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea before the Second Committee.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg022-bk14-pa03">International negotiations on fisheries are ongoing, both in the United Nations and in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Our joining the consensus in the adoption of this draft resolution today does not prejudge our position in the ongoing negotiations in the international forums I have just mentioned.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg022-bk14-pa04">In our opinion, the crux of the issue is how to obtain the maximum sustainable utilization of living marine resources. As stated in article 62 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the achievement of this optimum goal requires cooperation in fisheries between coastal and other States.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg022-bk14-pa05">The Thai Government has actively supported the promotion of legitimate international fisheries cooperation between the private sector and neighbouring coastal States that do not have the capacity to harvest the entire allowable catch. Fisheries agreements with these countries have been obtained in the form of both licensing and joint ventures. We will continue to work in a spirit of cooperation and neighbourliness with these regional coastal States in order to obtain a mutually beneficial arrangement on this issue of fisheries, conservation and management.</p>

This initiative will link schoolchildren, teachers and scientists worldwide, energize scientific and environmental education and contribute to scientific research -- with the goal of enhancing our ability to protect the health of the planet and contribute to the promotion of sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg023-bk04-pa02">Although the GLOBE programme is still in its early start-up phase, the goal is to have the programme under way in at least 200 schools worldwide by the twenty-fifth Earth Day, in April 1995. The response to this initiative has been very gratifying. Over 100 countries have expressed an interest in the GLOBE programme and we are now developing a fruitful partnership with these countries. We will seek an effective partnership with the agencies and organizations of the United Nations as well. Certainly there is a great deal of experience and expertise within this institution that can further the objectives of the GLOBE programme and that can make a significant contribution to its successful implementation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg023-bk04-pa03">We look forward to working with you, Mr. President, and with all the Members of the United Nations to make the GLOBE programme as successful as possible.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg024-bk13-pa01">In our view, the United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks must firmly address the environmental issue for which that Conference was called: that is, to protect the straddling stocks and highly migratory species throughout the area of their distribution. This means that both the parties fishing on the high seas and those fishing within the economic zones will have to undertake obligations to conserve and manage those fish stocks in a sustainable manner, taking full account of the biological unity of the stocks.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg024-bk13-pa02">In this connection, I wish to refer to a statement made by the Chairman of the Second Committee during the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, which reflected the consensus of the delegations at that session. The Chairman said:</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg024-bk13-pa03">"It is understood that the Conference must also resolve the question of the relationship between the proper management and conservation of the fish resources concerned in the high seas and in areas under national jurisdiction in the light of the biological unity of those stocks".</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg024-bk13-pa04">The European Union has throughout the Conference sought to advance a reasonable position that takes full account of the interests of both high-seas and coastal fishing States. We feel that only a responsible attitude by both can make a difference in the important task of conserving these fish stocks.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg024-bk13-pa05">We feel we made good progress at the last session of the Conference, and we continue to hope that it will succeed under the able chairmanship of Ambassador Nandan. We look forward to cooperating with him in the coming months.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg029-bk08-pa03">Joining the least developed countries is not a happy occasion. Indeed, the happiness will come when my country graduates from this group. But since the prevailing economic situation obliges my country to be listed as one of the least developed countries, I want to take the opportunity to thank the Committee for Development Planning, the Economic and Social Council, the Second Committee and the plenary General Assembly, all of which helped in the long process of adding my country to this group.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg029-bk08-pa04">Eritrea, the newest African nation, emerges with tremendous inherited economic and social problems. But my Government and the people of Eritrea are committed to turning things around in the same spirit in which they fought for 30 long years to win their human dignity. Last August, the National Assembly -- equivalent to Parliaments elsewhere -- approved a multifaceted macroeconomic policy that will in the long run bring a better quality of life to the people of Eritrea and a brighter future to its children.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg029-bk08-pa05">Eritrea also emerges at a time of the globalization and ever-deepening interdependence of the world economy. We therefore realize that the people of Eritrea cannot single-handedly accomplish the huge task of rehabilitation and development they have started.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg029-bk08-pa06">My country is grateful for the bilateral and multilateral assistance received so far, but I must also admit that this assistance falls far short of that needed to make the huge economic programme a success. Therefore, I would like at this juncture to make an appeal, on behalf of my Government, to the international community for a substantial increase in assistance to Eritrea. I assure the Assembly that my country will set a perfect example of successful international cooperation in bringing about sustainable development. Once the international community contributes its fair share, Eritrea will graduate very quickly from the group of least developed countries.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg029-bk10-pa02">Allow me, on behalf of the President, the Government and all the people of Kyrgyzstan, to express deepest gratitude and sincerest appreciation for the resolution (49/129) just adopted by the General Assembly, which proclaims 1995 the international year commemorating the millennium of the Kyrgyz national epic, <i>Manas</i>. Our special thanks go to the sponsors of the draft resolution on this matter.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg029-bk10-pa03">Kyrgyzstan, a new, independent State of Central Asia, located at the crossroads of the world's civilizations and religions, is engaged at present in the implementation of a task of epochal importance for us: building up a sound democratic society, based on the principles of political and economic freedoms for each citizen and respect for human rights. We have the appropriate prerequisites to meet this challenge: an industrious and peace-loving people, century-long traditions of democracy and tolerance, and the conscious choice of pluralistic democracy and market economy as ultimate goals. At this crucial stage of our development, the adoption of the resolution on <i>Manas </i>has extremely great importance for our people. We regard this event as the symbol of the spiritual and national rebirth of our ancient people and our young, independent State.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg029-bk10-pa04">From generation to generation, through their hardships and misfortunes, the Kyrgyz people have, with love and tenderness, preserved the epic to this day and have enriched the tradition of folk narration through the colourful diversity of individual interpretations. This epic, <i>Manas</i>, was composed in the vast territory from the Yenisey River in southern Siberia to the mountains of Tien Shan in Central Asia, in interaction with other people, and it can therefore be regarded as a cultural heritage not only of the Kyrgyz people but also of all Eurasia. Hence, we can view the adoption of this resolution as a recognition of the timeless value of the Kyrgyz people's epic, <i>Manas</i>, and as their contribution to the world's cultural and historical memory.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg029-bk10-pa05">The celebration of the millennium of <i>Manas </i>coincides with two events of utmost importance in the life of the world community: the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and the international Year for Tolerance. These three events are connected in a way, as all of them assert the ideals of peace, stability, justice and tolerance. We express our hope that the celebration of the millennium of <i>Manas </i>will become the appropriate contribution of the Kyrgyz people to cooperation and mutual understanding in the world.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk04-pa01">Members will recall that the Assembly concluded its debate on agenda item 42 at its 70th meeting, on 29 November 1994.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk04-pa02">The Assembly has before it draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.35-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.35/Rev.1</a>. The following countries have become co-sponsors of that draft resolution: Colombia, Ireland, Suriname and Venezuela.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mrs. Castro de Barish</span><span class="nation">Costa Rica</span><span class="language">Spanish</span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa01">The delegation of Costa Rica, on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Central American States -- El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama -- wishes to associate itself with those who have expressed condolences on the death of Ambassador Bradford Morse, who served as the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme with great skill and sensitivity. We convey our heartfelt condolences to the delegation of the United States and to the family of the late Mr. Morse.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa02">I have the signal honour of presenting to the members of the General Assembly for their consideration a draft resolution on agenda item 42, "The situation in Central America: procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development". I do so on behalf of the initial sponsors, the States of Central America -- El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica -- and of the co-sponsors whose names appear in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.35</a>, in addition to those just announced by the President.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa03">The text follows the broad lines of resolutions adopted earlier on this item. It recognizes the fact -- already recognized at the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly -- that there remain in Central America major obstacles to the full exercise of peace, freedom, democracy and development. It reaffirms the need for a global frame of reference that would enable the international community to channel support to the efforts of the Central American Governments.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa04">The draft resolution recognizes the importance and validity of the commitments assumed by the Central American Presidents at the Esquipulas II summit meeting and lists the subsequent summit meetings -- such as the one at Guatemala, from 27 to 29 October 1993, and the one at Guácimo, Costa Rica, from 18 to 20 August 1994; as well as the Central American Environmental Summit for Sustainable Development, held at Managua on 12 and 13 October 1994, and the International Conference on Peace and Development in Central America, held at Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on 24 and 25 October 1994 -- at which a framework of priorities for the formulation and implementation of an integrated strategy for sustainable development covering political, moral, economic, social and ecological matters was established.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa05">At this point, I wish to make two minor changes in operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution. In the first line the word "contained" should be replaced by the word "included". In the second line, after the words "Guácimo Declaration" the following words should be inserted: "and adopted at the Managua Environmental Summit". I hope that these minor changes will make clear when and where the process in question started and where it was finally adopted.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa06">The draft resolution also recognizes the importance of the peace-keeping operations that have been carried out in Central America pursuant to the decisions of the Security Council and with the support of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa07">It reaffirms that there can be no peace in Central America without sustainable development or democracy, which are essential for transforming the region and realizing the hopes of the Central American peoples and Governments. It is important also to emphasize the role of the Central American States in promoting economic growth in the context of human development, as well as the progress made in strengthening democracy and peace-building in the region. This has been amply demonstrated by the free and transparent elections which have taken place in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Panama.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa08">Concerning the specific situation of each country, the draft resolution highlights, for example, the progress made in the peace negotiations between the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca, with the assistance of the Secretary-General and the support of the Group of Friends of the peace process -- Colombia, Mexico, Norway, Spain, the United States of America and Venezuela.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa09">Mention is also made of the 1994 decision to establish the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala, in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary-General. The draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to continue his support for the Guatemalan peace process, through his Representative, and his assistance in implementing the agreements. It also encourages the United Nations system and the international community as a whole to continue their assistance in favour of peace, national reconciliation, democracy and development in Guatemala.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa10">The draft resolution notes with satisfaction the holding of free and democratic elections in El Salvador and the progress made towards fulfilment of the outstanding commitments assumed under the peace agreements, which is essential to promote reconciliation and maintain and consolidate peace in El Salvador. With this in mind, the draft resolution requests all States and invites the international development and financing institutions to react quickly and generously to the joint appeal of the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberacíon Nacional to provide the additional resources required fully to implement the peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa11">The draft resolution takes into account the efforts made by the Government of Nicaragua to promote broad national agreement as the best way of consolidating peace, national reconciliation, democracy and sustainable development with social justice. It welcomes with satisfaction the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-16.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/16</a> of 17 November 1994, entitled "International assistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Nicaragua; aftermath of the war and natural disasters", in which the exceptional circumstances prevailing in the case of Nicaragua are recognized. That is why it supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances, so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country's economic recovery and social reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa12">The draft resolution recognizes the valuable and effective contribution of the United Nations and of various governmental and non-governmental mechanisms to the process of democratization, peace and development in Central America, and the importance to the achievement of this goal of both the political dialogue and the economic cooperation set in motion by the Ministerial Conference between the European Union and the Central American countries and the joint initiative of the industrialized countries (Group of Twenty-four) and the group of cooperating countries (Group of Three) -- consisting of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela -- through the Partnership for Democracy and Development in Central America.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa13">It recognizes the importance of executed, updated and pending programmes and, in view of the fact that the resources assigned to the Special Plan of Economic Cooperation for Central America have been used up, requests the agencies of the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, and international institutions to mobilize the necessary resources to set in motion new national and regional programmes in support of the content of the Guácimo Declaration, the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America and the Tegucigalpa Commitments on Peace and Development in Central America, in order to prevent the progress made in Central America from being reversed.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV92-pg030-bk05-pa14">Finally, the draft resolution stresses the steps that Central America has taken towards achieving peace, democracy and sustainable development, and recognizes the major aspirations of our peoples and Governments <i>vis-à-vis</i> the role that we are convinced the international community, and in particular the United Nations system and the international development and financing institutions, can play in ensuring the success of this new Central American undertaking. We hope that the will of the General Assembly will reflect the draft resolution's letter and spirit. The peoples of Central America want freedom and peace. Today, Central America faces a new challenge: sustainable development and ecological harmony. That is why we reaffirm that the resolve and determination of Central Americans, as well as the support which their efforts receive from the international community, will be decisive in winning another and more glorious victory over poverty and economic and social backwardness. We are working with determination, resolve and commitment to achieve that goal.</p>
