	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk13-pa01">Almost one year ago, agenda item 163 was included in the agenda of the General Assembly on the pretext of urgency. At that time, Armenia unequivocally opposed the introduction of the item, stating clearly that all allegations levelled against Armenia were false, and suggested facilitating the dispatch of a fact-finding mission to assess the situation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk13-pa02">A fact-finding mission was launched by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the results were made available to all Member States represented at the United Nations. It clearly affirmed what Armenia had been stating all along: first, that overall settlement is quite limited and, secondly, that there is no clear organized resettlement, no non-voluntary resettlement and no recruitment. The fact-finding mission concluded that the overwhelming majority of settlers are displaced persons from various parts of Azerbaijan. Most important, the fact-finding mission saw no evidence of direct involvement by the authorities of Armenia in the territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk13-pa03">The result of the fact-finding mission should have put Azerbaijani concerns to rest and convinced Azerbaijan of the necessity of making a genuine effort to negotiate a lasting solution to the Nagorny Karabakh conflict, within the OSCE Minsk Group. As a matter of fact, there was a common understanding between the parties concerned that, with the convening of the fact-finding mission, the matter would be put to rest. It is with sadness that we note the futile effort of our negotiating partner to keep an agenda item alive by transferring its consideration to the sixtieth session, which is both pointless and counterproductive. We express our strong dissatisfaction with the Azerbaijani decision.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk13-pa04">We remind the General Assembly that Armenia is negotiating on behalf of Nagorny Karabakh within the OSCE Minsk group framework because Azerbaijan refuses to negotiate directly with the authorities of Nagorny Karabakh. Any Azerbaijani exploitation of that fact within international organizations will therefore result in Armenia's disengagement from the negotiation process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk13-pa05">Armenia was opposed to the inclusion of item 163 in the agenda of the fifty-ninth session. Armenia is opposed to the deferral of the consideration of the agenda item to the sixtieth session. Hence, Armenia dissociates itself from the decision to defer consideration of agenda item 163, "The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan," to the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.</div>
