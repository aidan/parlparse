	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the further report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Operation in Mozambique, <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1002.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1002</a>. Members of the Council also have before them the report of the Security Council Mission established pursuant to the statement made by the President of the Security Council at the 3406th meeting, held on 19 July 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-35.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/35</a>). The report of the Mission is contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1009.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1009</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General of 26 August 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1002.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1002</a>) on the United Nations Operation in Mozambique and notes with appreciation the report (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1009.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1009</a>) and oral briefing of the mission it sent to Mozambique to discuss with the parties how best to ensure full and timely implementation of the General Peace Agreement. It commends the mission for accomplishing its objectives, as set forth by the President of the Council on 4 August 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-931.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/931</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">&quot;The Security Council is satisfied, at present, with the pace of the peace process, including demobilization of all forces which will be completed shortly. It maintains a cautious optimism that Mozambicans will be able to fulfil the goals of the peace process, achieving democracy, lasting peace, and responsible, representative government in their country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the fact that the leaders of the main political parties in Mozambique and the National Elections Commission have confirmed their commitments to take all steps necessary to ensure the holding of elections on 27 and 28 October 1994, as scheduled. It underlines the importance of ensuring that the voter registration process reach as many Mozambicans as possible. Those parties who have concerns about the implementation of aspects of the electoral process should pursue them through the National Elections Commission. The Council reiterates its intention to endorse the results of the Mozambican elections provided the United Nations declares them as free and fair and reminds all the parties of their obligation under the General Peace Agreement fully to respect these results as well as the principles of democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">&quot;The Security Council reaffirms the importance of proceeding as expeditiously as possible with the formation and training of the new Mozambican Defence Force (FADM). It notes with satisfaction that both the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO have accepted the fact that the initial size of FADM will be consistent with training and recruitment constraints during the pre-election period. It encourages the Government of Mozambique speedily to complete the transfer of the requisite authority and assets from the Mozambique Armed Forces (FAM) to FADM. The Council calls upon Member States to help provide military training and appropriate equipment to the FADM.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">&quot;The Security Council expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for providing a detailed revised timetable for the phased withdrawal of ONUMOZ civilian and military personnel as set out in his report. The Council concurs with the Secretary-General that ONUMOZ should be deployed over a wider area of the country, keeping in mind the need to assist the Government in maintaining security, particularly in the crucial period before, during and immediately after the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">&quot;The Security Council notes the importance of ensuring that the Mozambican police have the resources required to maintain security in the country, in particular in the post-electoral period. It urges that the Mozambican police be provided with these resources, and calls upon Member States to assist in this regard by contributing to the training and equipment needs of the police.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">&quot;The Security Council expresses concern at the limited progress made to date in the area of demining. It welcomes efforts to revitalize that programme and urges all concerned to accelerate training and mine clearance activities, and work with the relevant Mozambican authorities towards the establishment of a national demining capability, including the possibility of leaving demining equipment in Mozambique after the withdrawal of ONUMOZ, subject to the appropriate arrangements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">&quot;The Security Council invites the Secretary-General to report on the final disposition of the assets of ONUMOZ within the framework of the withdrawal of ONUMOZ.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">&quot;The Security Council encourages the parties to continue their efforts in good faith to ensure post-electoral harmony on the basis of the observance of the democratic principles accepted by them in the General Peace Agreement as well as on the basis of the spirit and letter of that Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa13">&quot;The Security Council notes that the post-election period will be an important and delicate time, during which the international community will need to assist the Mozambicans in the rehabilitation and development of their country, and in this regard calls upon the Secretary-General to report to the competent United Nations bodies on what further role the United Nations can perform.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa14">&quot;The Council commends the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in moving the peace process forward. It expresses its gratitude to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and his dedicated staff for the assistance rendered to the mission sent by the Security Council to Mozambique.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa15">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-51.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/51</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa16">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
