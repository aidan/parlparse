	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">"The Security Council expresses its profound regret over the death of First Vice President of Sudan Dr. John Garang de Mabior in a helicopter crash on 30 July 2005. The Security Council offers its deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of Dr. Garang and to the people and Government of the Republic of Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa04">"This is a time for the world community to come together to support Dr. Garang's vision of a united and peaceful Sudan. The Security Council commends the perseverance and commitment which the parties in Sudan demonstrated in achieving the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the promise of a new future. Over the last few years, Dr. Garang's courageous efforts were instrumental in ending the over 21-year civil war that cost the lives of millions of Sudanese. His leadership offered hope of democracy and peace for all people of Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa05">"The Security Council calls on all Sudanese to honour his memory by restoring peace and calm throughout Sudan. The Security Council trusts that, despite the sudden death of Dr. Garang, the people of Sudan remain united and continue to work for the consolidation of peace in the country by implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, for which Dr. Garang worked unstintingly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">"The Security Council stresses that the death of Dr. Garang should not deter the struggle of the Sudanese people for justice and dignity, and encourages the people of Sudan to refrain from violence and maintain peace in the midst of mourning.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its determination to assist the Sudanese people in their efforts to promote national reconciliation, resolve the conflicts in Darfur and restore peace and stability throughout the country and to build a prosperous and united Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa08">"The Security Council looks to the international community to continue its support for the people of Sudan to implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, to resolve the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and to proceed with the reconstruction and rehabilitation process."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-38.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/38</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
