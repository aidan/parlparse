We all look forward to collaborating closely with Ambassador Zhang, and we wish him every success in his new functions. I give the floor to Ambassador Zhang.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa01">Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your heartwarming remarks. I am greatly honoured to be appointed as Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations. This provides me with an opportunity to work together with all my colleagues here. I understand that, in working in this Chamber, we are undertaking the task of maintaining international peace and security with the trust of all the Member States of the United Nations. Only by making concerted efforts and sincerely cooperating can we achieve the tasks before us.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">I know that all my colleagues here had very good cooperative relations with my predecessor, Ambassador Wang Guangya. I am confident that members will continue to be very generous in providing full support to me and to the Chinese Mission to the United Nations. That will be especially important next month, when China will assume the presidency of the Security Council. I hope to have very good cooperation with my colleagues here and expect to enjoy full support and cooperation from the Council and the Secretariat.</p>
