	Mr. Qin Huasun (China)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa01">Allow me at the outset to convey to you, Sir, the heartfelt thanks of the Chinese delegation for your expression of grief at the loss of life in the recent floods in China and your sentiments of sympathy and solicitude for the Chinese people for the property and economic losses caused by the floods.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa02">The melting of ice and snow at the source of the Yangtze River, as a result of global warming, led to a rise of the water level in the middle and lower reaches of the river to a height far exceeding that of previous years, causing severe flooding in 10 provinces of Southern China, most seriously in Hunan and Jiangxi. According to preliminary statistics, from May to 4 July 1995, the floods took the lives of 1,179 people, injured 26,115 and resulted in economic losses of $4.4 billion.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa03">At present, the floodwater in Hunan is subsiding. The situation in that province may stop deteriorating if there are no more heavy rains. However, the water level in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is still rising slowly, and the provinces and cities along the river are making every effort to fight against the floods.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa04">The Chinese Government attaches great importance to this flood situation. It has led and organized the relevant departments of the central Government and governments at various levels in their efforts to mobilize human, material and financial resources to combat the floods. It has also encouraged the people in flood-stricken areas to make persistent efforts in their battle against the floods, to resume production as soon as possible, to rebuild their homeland and minimize the losses caused by the floods.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa05">The international community has shown concern for the rather serious floods that have occurred in China in recent years, for which I should like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa01">In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-980(1995).pdf">resolution 980 (1995)</a>, adopted by the Security Council on 22 March 1995, the General Assembly will proceed to the election of a member of the International Court of Justice for the unexpired term of office of Judge Sir Robert Yewdall Jennings, whose resignation took effect on 10 July 1995.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa02">In connection with this election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the members of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa03">Firstly, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 264 (III) of 8 October 1948, a State which is a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice but not a Member of the United Nations shall participate in the General Assembly in electing the members of the Court in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. On this occasion I am happy to welcome here the representatives of Nauru and Switzerland.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa04">Secondly, I should like to confirm that at this time the Security Council, independently of the General Assembly, is also proceeding to elect one member of the Court. This procedure is in accordance with Article 8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa05">"The General Assembly and the Security Council shall proceed independently of one another to elect the members of the Court."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa06">Accordingly, the results of the voting in the General Assembly will not be communicated to the Security Council until one candidate has obtained the required majority in the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa07">Thirdly, I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The Assembly has before it document <a href="../pdf/A-49-931.pdf">A/49/931</a>, which contains a memorandum by the Secretary-General on the present composition of the Court and the procedure to be followed in the General Assembly and in the Security Council with regard to the election; document <a href="../pdf/A-49-932.pdf">A/49/932</a>, which contains the name of the candidate who has been nominated by national groups within the required time for submission, that is, by 21 June 1995; document <a href="../pdf/A-49-940.pdf">A/49/940</a> and Add.1, providing information concerning nominations received from national groups after 21 June 1995; and document <a href="../pdf/A-49-933.pdf">A/49/933</a>, which contains the curriculum vitae of the candidate nominated by national groups.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa08">In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa09">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose, are all the Member States -- 185 -- and two non-Member States, Nauru and Switzerland. Accordingly, 94 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of electing a judge of the International Court of Justice.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa10">The General Assembly will now proceed to a secret ballot. If in the first ballot, no candidate obtains an absolute majority, it will be necessary to proceed to other ballots until a candidate has obtained that majority. Pursuant to the decision taken by the General Assembly at its 915th meeting, on 16 November 1960, these ballots shall be unrestricted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa11">I should like to remind representatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the Assembly's rules of procedure,</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa12">"After the President has announced the beginning of voting, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order in connection with the actual conduct of the voting".</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk07">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Naranjo Villalobos" nation="Costa Rica" language="Spanish">
	Mr. Naranjo Villalobos (Costa Rica)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa01">I wish to extend once again Costa Rica's gratitude to the President of the General Assembly for his wise and efficient leadership of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa02">We are a few weeks away from the solemn occasion when Presidents and Heads of State and Government from all over the world will gather in the city of New York for the General Assembly and to commemorate, on behalf of humankind, the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa03">However, with candour and realism, it must be noted that the overview of peace in which the United Nations is celebrating its first half-century of existence is not completely positive.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa04">The ideological conflict that dominated the world during the second half of this century has been succeeded by a mosaic of explosions of violence that are difficult to characterize, but in which, almost without exception, the clash of cultures is identified as the source of the dispute.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa05">In the settlement of disputes, Costa Rica has adopted an original and non-traditional approach.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa06">In 1948, at the end of a civil war in my country which had as its main goal the defence of democratic institutions and the re-establishment of an electoral regime which assured respect for the popular vote, the victors, instead of using arms as a means to stay in power, decided to abolish the armed forces. Rather than dividing up among themselves the economic resources resulting from the abolition of the army, they invested them in education, health services and the infrastructure, thus establishing the foundation for a truly democratic project, based on the existence of a broad middle class and the practice of a market economy moderated by social responsibility.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa07">This type of thinking explains the draft resolution for World Week of Peace, considered under item 44 of the agenda of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa08">The President of Costa Rica, José Maria Figueres, like the men in 1948 who found novel solutions for the problems of democracy and the armed forces and the construction of the Costa Rican social State, has decided to propose, if not a solution, at least an opportunity for the activities of war that have generated and sustained the armed conflicts that have caused so much destruction to human life and the world's cultural heritage and environment to stop for a week in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa09">The purpose of this "space for peace" is to allow all human beings involved in these conflicts both as victims and as belligerents to reveal in one way or another their objectives, thus initiating a process of dialogue and harmonization which is the only true path towards stable and long-lasting peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa10">Costa Rica is pleased that the following 61 Member States have understood the message of peace that I am now presenting to this session of the General Assembly in the hope that the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.66.pdf">A/49/L.66</a> will be adopted without a vote. It has been co-sponsored by the delegations of Algeria, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Georgia, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Morocco, Mongolia, Nepal, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Togo and Uruguay.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa11">To all of them, we extend our deepest gratitude, on behalf of all peace-loving men and women.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa12">Most of the different cultures of the world are represented in the group of sponsors; the simple fact that they have participated in this peace initiative represents a great source of hope in the struggle to resolve the armed conflicts that trouble the end of this century.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa13">In addition to the 61 sponsors, we feel that the Charter is also on our side. The draft that we are promoting reminds us, in its preamble, of the primary purposes and principles of the United Nations. It is also consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Year for Tolerance, and it recognizes and stresses the important role of Disarmament Week in promoting international peace and security; indeed, the celebration of Disarmament Week will coincide with the World Week of Peace we are proclaiming.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa14">In this sense, the Nobel Peace Prize laureates who attended the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations at San Francisco -- Dr. Betty Williams, Director of the Global Foundation for Children, His Excellency Mr. Lech Walesa, President of Poland, the Most Reverend Desmond Tutu, Archbishop of Cape Town, and Mr. Oscar Arias-Sanchez, former President of Costa Rica -- stated that</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg004-bk07-pa15">"the key impact of the United Nations campaign against armed conflicts must consist in the active promotion of tolerance and peaceful coexistence among all peoples. While efforts are made to reduce the arms trade, the peace-building activities of the United Nations should include measures which strongly discourage all forms of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, class or any other condition".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa16">The argument of Costa Rica has a moral character rather than a technical or military one, and proposes a concrete action: the declaration of a week in which there should be a general effort on behalf of peace around the world. Let us fight for life instead of death; let us fight for the promotion of progress instead of destruction; let us fight for reconciliation instead of hatred.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa17">In this context, the support we request from all members of the General Assembly is what amounts to a pledge from each country to undertake activities in favour of peace during the week beginning 24 October. We also request the Secretary-General to ensure the broadest possible dissemination of this resolution through the Department of Public Information and to report on its implementation to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa18">Among all foreseeable efforts for the implementation of the resolution, the achievement of a cease-fire in all areas of conflict would be the ideal result.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa19">We are aware of the limitations on such an achievement, but we are firmly convinced that we should not miss the opportunity represented by the fiftieth anniversary of the creation the Organization to present to the world an initiative in favour of peace. Not to present this initiative would be tantamount to sharing the indifference that, without any doubt, is the cause of various conflicts that the world currently faces. If just one human being -- a child, a women or a man -- is saved from death by it, the effort will have been well worth while. In this regard, the objective of the proposal is to call the attention of the international community to the need to change its attitude towards war and to adopt a new attitude in favour of peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa20">With this draft resolution, we pay tribute to our forefathers for their desire for peace, embodied in 1945 in the creation of this Organization to fight permanently for world peace. The culture of war that has prevailed throughout the ages must now be transformed into a culture of peace. The same energy that in the past has been directed towards war must now be used to achieve peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk07-pa21">Developing this culture of peace, in opposition to the culture of war, must be -- starting with the celebration of this anniversary -- the principal objective of the United Nations. This, and no other, is the path of humanity towards the twenty-first century.</div>

The context in which it was created was one of warfare, and the purposes of the United Nations specifically relate to the proscription of war. Yet these very facts have often been responsible for an institutional attitude in which we think of peace as a condition that might come about piecemeal in particular cases where exhaustion or accident or, rarely, persuasion might induce the participants in specific armed struggles to seek some respite.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa03">However, peace should involve globalism that transcends particular struggles. Peacemaking should also be anticipatory in nature, and not just reactive. Peace should be a permanent condition for which we strive, using all our combined powers of creativity. The draft before the Assembly satisfies these criteria. This inspired draft resolution looks at peace as a universal and transcendent phenomenon in which all peoples and States jointly and simultaneously participate. The drafter has not been embarrassed to seek to anticipate what may appear to be a Utopian future and has boldly proposed what at first glance seems, or what jaded experience might suggest is, unattainable.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa04">With creativity the Government of Costa Rica has again challenged us to discover new visions for our civilization. I say "again" because Costa Rica has consistently been in the vanguard of the movement for internal harmony and peace. Over the years the Government and people of Costa Rica have acted with wisdom, maturity and responsibility in providing a shining example in the two subregions of which my country is a member.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa05">We have been running the risk that our fiftieth anniversary celebrations will be to some extent an exercise in nostalgia. This is partly because we have tended to focus on the year 1945. That was a year in which we saw quite clearly the direction in which the war was heading. By June 1945 the wartime United Nations allies could almost think about the war in the past tense. However, in 1995 we should not reflect on 1945 without actively recollecting all the years 1939 through 1944 and what the war and the 1942 United Nations alliance were all about.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa06">When we recall these realities we should also recollect that the very expression "United Nations" was born out of a dire situation, which universally demanded radical creativity and the penetrating vision that is exemplified in this draft resolution. It is something to be thankful for that the draft now provides a concrete focus for our fiftieth anniversary commemoration. It provides a useful foil, or counterpoint, for the wise statements that will be delivered at the forthcoming special commemorative meeting.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa07">My delegation is therefore proud to be one of the sponsors of the draft resolution and to urge that it be adopted by consensus.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa01">Cyprus, a peace-loving nation, is proud to be a sponsor of the draft resolution entitled "World Week of Peace" and congratulates Costa Rica for its commendable initiative.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa02">Bearing in mind that the promotion of peace and the prevention of war is not only one of the primary purposes of the United Nations, but also the necessary prerequisite for a peaceful and prosperous world, we fully support this idea. In this respect, we express our sincere hope that the moral message emanating from this initiative will make an impact on those who, despite the fact that they are in a position to affect significantly the course of international affairs towards a peaceful and just future, opt, for the sake of micro-political expediency, to allow the illegal use of force or the preservation of a status created by such methods, even in those cases where the United Nations has demanded the repeal of such a <i>fait accompli</i>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa03">My country, with its own bitter experience of foreign invasion and occupation, invites all Member States to support the initiative at hand and to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the World Week of Peace, especially within the framework of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, to reflect on practical ways to impose international peace in a just world.</div>

	Mr. Valencia Rodriguez (Ecuador)
</span>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa01">The delegation of Ecuador is a sponsor of the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.66.pdf">A/49/L.66</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa02">I wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm, first and foremost, the sentiments expressed by earlier speakers. After a half-century of existence for the United Nations, I believe that it is well worthwhile to draw the urgent attention of the political leaders of the 185 Member States of the Organization, of the international bodies which in one way or another strive daily to lay and strengthen the foundations of peace, of the entities of every kind that are inspired by the same goals, of intellectual, university and academic circles -- in short, of all the men and women of the world -- to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, the paramount international instrument of our time.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa03">We feel that it is necessary, during the World Week of Peace -- which will be celebrated concurrently with Disarmament Week -- that everyone, governors and governed, regardless of our social or economic conditions, should engage in serious soul-searching to consider how these purposes and principles have been fulfilled. What shortcomings and obstacles have we encountered along the way, and what measures need to be adopted if we are to overcome those difficulties? We should also reflect on the outlook for the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa04">Though over the past 50 years we have avoided the devastation of a third world war -- which in present circumstances would have been an annihilating catastrophe for the entire human race because of the immeasurable power of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, whose stockpiles remain the gravest threat to the main objective of the United Nations -- it is equally true that we have witnessed and occasionally participated in serious conflicts that have caused and continue to cause great loss of human life, untold suffering, collective anguish, misery and disease.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa05">The soul-searching and reflection that we should undertake during the World Week of Peace should lead us ineluctably to renew our resolve to pursue our ongoing search, through the peaceful procedures established by the Charter, for just and equitable solutions, the fruit of agreement among parties, to the serious conflicts that persist throughout the world. Many of those conflicts have long and dangerously endured. They are the cause of serious political and military confrontations, locally and internationally, and unfortunately continue to emerge regularly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa06">During this Week, we should express our faith in the foundations of harmonious coexistence of peoples, the need to promote international cooperation, the defence and protection of human rights, progress, economic and social development and the full flourishing of democracy. All of this should undoubtedly lead to the maintenance of authentic and stable peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa07">The delegation of Ecuador, as a sponsor of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.66.pdf">A/49/L.66</a>, therefore strongly urges that the proposed World Week of Peace be a powerful mechanism for reaffirming the determination of our peoples to maintain international peace and security. We must give full weight to the principles of the Charter, including the non-resort to the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, as well as the obligation to settle international disputes exclusively by peaceful means.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Melendez-Barahona" nation="El Salvador" language="Spanish">
	Mr. Melendez-Barahona (El Salvador)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa01">On behalf of the countries of Central America, I have the honour to make this statement expressing our solidarity with and fraternal support for one member of our group, Costa Rica, and for the happy initiative taken by its Head of State, President José María Figueres, in proposing the Proclamation of the World Week of Peace as a contribution to the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa02">Throughout history we have seen innumerable armed conflicts to which the international community has reacted with great and constant efforts to seek peace and the solution of conflicts by peaceful means in order to avoid the sufferings and other grave consequences of war. In the current century, the League of Nations represented one such major effort, but it was an example which unfortunately received insufficient support to act consistently and effectively to avoid and eradicate war between nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa03">The destructiveness, calamity and suffering wrought upon humanity during the First and Second World Wars have demonstrated the need for a more secure and effective mechanism for maintaining or restoring international peace and security. This ultimately took shape as the United Nations, whose Charter clearly lays down the purposes and principles of the Organization and the means to attain them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa04">Looking back on events in the evolution of our Organization as well as at the current world situation, we see that a number of armed conflicts have taken place and continue to take place in various regions of the world. We must recognize the limitations and constraints on United Nations action to prevent and find solutions to these conflicts. In many cases the United Nations has had a marginal function, particularly during the years of East-West rivalry, when certain international crises were dealt with outside the framework of the Organization, a phenomenon that has not yet completely disappeared.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa05">As we approach the twenty-first century, we must also recognize and reaffirm that the maintenance of international peace and security continues to be one of the paramount objectives of the United Nations. It was thought at a certain point that the functions of the Organization would be more effectively carried out when the constraints on its activity gave way to a strengthening of cooperation and international solidarity. But reality has shown that there are still limitations and constraints beyond the control of the Organization which delay or prevent the quest for solutions, thus giving the impression that the search for peace is an unattainable aspiration. Of even greater concern is that when specific conflicts threaten to intensify or spread, they not only become a danger to the peace so much desired by the international community, particularly by the peoples that suffer the horrors of war, but also have a negative impact on the credibility and prestige of our Organization. The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Somalia, Chechnya and elsewhere are tragic examples of this reality.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa06">However, we must not be discouraged by these cases or others that have called into question the multilateral system, because we are aware and convinced of the value of the United Nations. The Organization is the only global system whose purposes and principles are in force and constitute a hope for peoples, which becomes especially clear if we bear in mind that in recent years some successful results have been achieved in the promotion and establishment of peace in the world. We could mention with satisfaction the cases of Nicaragua and El Salvador in Central America, as well as Haiti, Angola, Cambodia, Mozambique and others.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa07">In order for the Organization to fulfil its mandate effectively, it is essential that the Member States be prepared to put into practice the provisions of the Charter. But we must also recognize that we are experiencing a crisis of the political will needed to fulfil our obligations and functions in the interests of the international community. It seems as though we were trying to avoid our responsibilities rather than meet them, even those arising from the binding resolutions of the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa08">I think it is fitting to note that the Nobel peace laureates who went to San Francisco for the recent commemoration of the signing of the United Nations Charter, on 26 June 1945, declared authoritatively that</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg007-bk03-pa09">"More than any other international organization or individual Government, the United Nations has a crucial role to play in the prevention and resolution of armed conflicts, which was the primary concern 50 years ago. The persistence of armed conflicts remains an intolerable reality today. Since 1945 the world has experienced more than 150 armed conflicts, more than 30 of which continue to rage today. The United Nations can reduce armed conflicts to a great extent by taking the lead in the promotion of demilitarization, starting with an immediate reduction in the production and trade of arms."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa10">We are convinced that today's initiative is consistent with the purposes and principles of our Organization. In spirit it is aimed principally at mitigating the dire conditions suffered by peoples because of war, whether internal or international. It is intended to offer a period of reflection, particularly so that parties directly involved in armed conflict can open their eyes to the destruction and sufferings of war and the need to seek a solution by peaceful means, including through the means provided for in the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk03-pa11">Finally, we wish in particular to reiterate our support for the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.66.pdf">A/49/L.66</a>, entitled "World Week of Peace", in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, which the countries of Central America are honoured to sponsor.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa01">First of all, the delegation of the Republic of Korea would like to pay tribute to the Government of Costa Rica for its dedication and continued efforts to promote world peace. My delegation is very pleased to work with the delegation of Costa Rica and as a sponsor of the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.66.pdf">A/49/L.66</a>, under the agenda item entitled "Commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations in 1995".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa02">We believe that the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations offers a rare opportunity to bring the nations and the peoples of the world closer together through honest reflection about society so that we may forge a better future. It is with this hopeful sentiment that we show our support for this draft resolution, which could further our goal of achieving lasting universal peace for current and succeeding generations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Bearing in mind that the promotion of peace and the prevention of war are primary goals of the United Nations, it would be truly fitting to observe the World Week of Peace in solemn commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. We would set a milestone for the promotion and realization of the lofty goals of peace, freedom and human rights. The observance of the World Week of Peace could also help to end recent conflicts which have brought deplorable ethnic strife, destruction and displacement or, at the very least, could bring a moment of peace and hope to afflicted individuals and communities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Demonstrating the will to work harder and cooperate fully to promote peace and security, my delegation wishes to reiterate its willingness to co-sponsor the draft resolution and express its sincere hope that the draft resolution will be adopted by consensus.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Türk" nation="Slovenia" language="">
	Mr. Türk (Slovenia)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa01">Slovenia is among the sponsors of the draft resolution submitted to the General Assembly for the proclamation of a World Week of Peace starting on 24 October 1995. The World Week of Peace should be an opportunity and a reminder: an opportunity for effective humanitarian action in the areas affected by armed conflict and a reminder to all United Nations Members and all peoples to strengthen their efforts for peace and tolerance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The maintenance of peace and security is the prime objective and purpose of the United Nations. It is no secret that the United Nations has not always succeeded in making this purpose a reality. Severe military conflicts rage in various parts of the world even as we, the delegates to the United Nations, deliberate here today. In the United Nations system the Security Council bears primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Council is endowed with appropriate functions and powers under the Charter and is composed of members which have at their disposal the necessary means for effective action. All this creates great responsibility.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The primary responsibility for peace and security, which is bestowed upon the Security Council, is not, however, an exclusive matter, all the more so since the Council has too often shown weakness and lack of effectiveness -- hence the need for other organs to reflect on their contribution in accordance with their respective functions and powers in the efforts for peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa04">The draft resolution submitted today represents an important element in the variety of activities pursued by the General Assembly in this domain. It comes at the time of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, a time when a visionary approach is necessary. It is addressed not only to United Nations Member States but also, and perhaps most importantly, to the people in those States. Its content expresses a basic moral imperative: the imperative of tolerance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa05">The Nobel Peace laureates declared in their statement on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg009-bk01-pa06">"A key thrust of the United Nations campaign against armed conflict should be the active cultivation of tolerance and peaceful coexistence among peoples".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa07">It is our hope that this moral imperative, which is the core of the message of the draft resolution before us, will reach the people. Ideas accepted by the people and based upon a powerful moral norm have the capacity to change reality in a meaningful and significant way.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa08">We congratulate Costa Rica on taking this initiative, and we urge the General Assembly to adopt the draft resolution without a vote.</div>

	Mr. Rowe (Australia)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa01">The first stated purpose of the United Nations under its Charter is to "maintain international peace and security".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa02">It is that fundamental objective which is the basis for the draft resolution proclaiming a World Week of Peace, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Worship of Costa Rica has introduced this morning.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa03">We wish to express our appreciation to the Government of Costa Rica for the important initiative which it has taken in sponsoring this draft resolution, of which Australia is a co-sponsor.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa04">The proclamation of a World Week of Peace is, in our view, highly appropriate and relevant to the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of this Organization. Six years ago, the fall of the Berlin Wall brought to an end 40 years of sterile confrontation between the super-Powers. The world was a more optimistic place in 1989 than it is today. Those six years, with their nightmarish scenes of conflict in places such as Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia, have shown how illusory were the hopes that the cold war would immediately be replaced by a new era of peace and security for the world's people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa05">Those six years have brought their full measure of challenge for the international community and the United Nations. They have shown that the United Nations and its Member States have not yet developed a clear and confident sense of the United Nations own role in the new environment with which we are confronted, where the most common source of conflict is no longer disputes between States but explosive conflict within States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa06">This situation requires that in this historic anniversary year we resolve collectively to make a greater effort at cooperating for peace. We have to recapture some of the original vision built into the aims of the Charter of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa07">Crucially, we have to reintegrate the relationship between the three basic objectives of peace -- meeting the need for security; development -- meeting economic needs; and human rights and justice -- meeting the needs for individual and group dignity and liberty.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa08">We must recognize that for any viable modern concept of international peace, including peace within States, there can be no sustainable peace without development and no development without peace. We have to give greater emphasis and attention to strategies for peace-building and preventive diplomacy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa09">The World Week of Peace will provide a focus for the international community to renew its commitment to peace and the prevention of war. It will provide a special opportunity for all Member States and all peoples of the world to reaffirm their commitment to one of the cornerstones of our United Nations by observing a period of universal peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa10">It is also significant that the World Week of Peace will be observed concurrently with Disarmament Week, which plays an important role in promoting international peace and security. We can have no doubt that conflicts whose roots lie elsewhere are invariably ignited by weapons in the wrong hands. The United Nations must step up its commitment to eradicate weapons of mass destruction and tackle the problem of excessive and destabilizing conventional weapons, especially illicit flows of sophisticated weapons technology.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa11">Disarmament Week has been celebrated annually since its establishment by resolutions of the first United Nations special session on disarmament and of the General Assembly in 1978. For Disarmament Week, States are invited to carry out effective measures to expose the danger of the arms race, propagate the need for its cessation and increase public understanding of the urgent tasks of disarmament.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa12">There is currently no more urgent task than to conclude the negotiations currently under way in Geneva on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. It is imperative that nuclear testing must cease.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa13">Australia therefore deplores France's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific. This decision is deeply offensive to Australia and to other countries in the South Pacific region, all of which have strongly condemned it, as have many other countries in other parts of the world. We strongly urge France to reconsider its decision.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa14">A very distinguished Australian, Mr. H. V. Evatt, who, as Foreign Minister of Australia, played an important role in the development of the Organization and, in 1948, was President of the General Assembly, pleaded for Governments to keep faith with their peoples. They wanted, he said,</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg009-bk02-pa15">"not very much, just peace and justice and decent standards of living for themselves, perhaps, but mainly for their children".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa16">Those are simple and modest words. They remind us that the United Nations does not belong to the powerful and the wealthy but to the ordinary men, women and children of the world. It was founded on a promise that never again would their leaders bring them war, injustice and poverty. That promise has not to date been honoured, but we have a second chance, as we enter into the next 50 years of the United Nations, to fulfil that promise by bringing to the people of the world "peace, justice and decent standards of living".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa17">The World Week of Peace, to commence on the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, will be a significant step towards realizing that promise.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa01">My delegation welcomes the submission of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.66.pdf">A/49/L.66</a>. We wish to state that we attach special importance to the World Week of Peace to begin on 24 October 1995 on the occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and that, on this occasion, the States signatories to the United Nations Charter should recognize that a culture of peace is part of the international responsibility laid down in it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa02">For international peace and cooperation to be achieved among peoples, in conformity with respect for the principles of the Charter, the international legal order and for treaties, national educational policies and their content are of crucial and enduring importance. Only through those policies will we ultimately be able to overcome feelings of vengeance, hostility and hatred among the peoples of the United Nations. In this respect, my delegation wishes to stress the complementarity of this particular draft resolution with other similar international instruments. We would refer in particular to the Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which states in its preamble that, since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa03">It is in that spirit that my delegation, as a sponsor of this text, would like to see the draft resolution adopted without a vote.</div>

	Mr. Rodriguez-Parrilla (Cuba)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Any effort in favour of peace will always receive the support of the Republic of Cuba. This is our historic vocation. A just peace is the keenest aspiration of the Cuban people. Any effort towards the integration of what José Martí called "our America" will always find Cuba ready to set aside the interests of our own small island and subordinate them to those of the great family of nations to which we are honoured to belong.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Our conception of peace is indeed universal and encompasses and integrates many things. For us, peace is much more than the absence of war. The philosophy of peace, in our opinion, implies a recognition of all its facets and components. That is why we are alarmed by any reductive approach and by the preeminence, as we approach the end of a century full of social, political and military conflicts, of a philosophy that ignores or underestimates the underlying causes of humanity's problems.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa03">We cannot rejoice at the fact that, today, the search for a solution to conflicts tends to ignore the causes of those conflicts. In our view, solutions linked to "An Agenda for Peace" and exercises of preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peace-building share this common failing: that the imposition of peace by force of arms is always a sad and traumatic exercise. Worse still, it is sterile and reversible if the deep-seated causes of the conflicts are not addressed. To be sure, negotiation based on respect -- and hence on tolerance, rapprochement and dialogue -- is a longer and slower process than military operations, but it is more humane, more creative and, above all, more effective.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa04">The dimension of development in the matter of peace is, in our opinion, an inescapable one. No one can be unaware of the intimate relationship between peace and development, nor could anyone call it into question. No speech or document should fail to mention it, because it is the key to the future. Nor can there be any doubt that respect for the sovereignty of States is a decisive requirement in the quest for peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The World Week of Peace being debated today will coincide with the commemorative meeting to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, that is, the summit meeting of our Heads of State. It is our hope that the draft resolution before us today will mark a real commitment. It would be unfortunate if it were to go down in history as a mere rhetorical exercise unfulfilled by the Heads of State assembled here to make other commitments.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa06">In our view, the most important thing is to ensure that the days after 24 October are indeed days of peace. At least for those few days, let us hope that there can be a suspension of military conflicts; an end to the threat or use of force, to coercive measures, to political, financial and commercial pressures brought to bear against small States, and to encroachments on the sovereignty of States and on the principles of the Charter. Let us hope that, during those days, the gap between the developed and the developing world ceases to widen. Let us hope that those few days can ease the growing contradictions between North and South. And let us hope that all of suffering humanity may find peace, a worthy peace, a peace with justice, a peace for all. If this draft resolution can spark the enormous effort required to achieve its worthy aims, then Cuba, in the belief that it is possible, will make its own decisive contribution.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk05-pa01">On behalf of the group of countries Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti, of Haiti itself and of Antigua and Barbuda, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Honduras, Italy, Ireland, Jamaica, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, I have the honour to introduce the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.67-Rev.1.pdf">A/49/L.67/Rev.1</a>, entitled "The situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti". This draft resolution concerns the renewal of the mandate of the joint United Nations/Organization of American States (OAS) International Civilian Mission to Haiti (MICIVIH).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk05-pa02">The preambular part of the text contains references to all previous initiatives approved by the Assembly and the Security Council, as well as to resolutions adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the member countries of the Organization of American States and by the Permanent Council of that regional organization. It also reaffirms that the goal of the international community in Haiti remains the full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the promotion of social and economic development in Haiti. It makes specific reference to the recent legislative elections held in Haiti within the framework of the full restoration of democracy. It supports the energetic work of Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali and of the Secretary-General of the OAS. It welcomes with satisfaction the success of MICIVIH and the contribution to that success of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and his entire staff. It also welcomes the efforts by States to provide humanitarian assistance and technical cooperation to the people of Haiti at this very crucial time. It expresses full support for the mandate of MICIVIH in regard to the full observance of human rights and the full restoration of the constitutional democracy of Haiti. It also pays tribute to the staff of the Mission and takes note of the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/A-49-926.pdf">A/49/926</a>), as well as the annex containing the letter from President Aristide to the Secretary-General requesting the extension of the mandate of the Mission.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk05-pa03">The operative part of the text approves the recommendation of the Secretary-General to renew the mandate of the joint Mission until 7 February 1996. It expresses full support for the Mission and pays tribute to the Haitian people for their efforts on behalf of democracy, economic prosperity and national reconciliation. It expresses its appreciation to those States which have assisted in the restoration of democracy to Haiti and the return of its constitutional President. It welcomes the prospect of presidential elections towards the end of this year and the transition to a new, democratically elected government in accordance with the Constitution of Haiti. It reaffirms the commitment of the international community to an increase in technical, economic and financial cooperation in Haiti, in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen its democratic institutions. It commends the cooperation between the United Nations and the OAS and requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to support Haitian efforts directed towards national reconstruction and development and to continue coordination of the efforts of the United Nations system in humanitarian assistance and development in Haiti. Finally, the text requests the Secretary-General to submit regular reports on the matter and decides to keep open its consideration of the item.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk05-pa04">In the hope that the plenary Assembly will be able to adopt the text without a vote, I take this opportunity to make a very brief statement in my national capacity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk05-pa05">My Government's commitment to the return of the constitutional President of Haiti, to the promotion and protection of human rights and to the democratization of that sister nation has been constant and unfailing. From our seat in this forum, as well as in the critical initiatives undertaken in the Security Council, including participation in the field with a civilian, military and police presence in the various phases of the Haitian crisis, we have sought to assist as best we could in the democratic recovery of the Haitian people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk05-pa06">Now, it falls to us to renew the mandate of the joint United Nations/OAS International Civilian Mission to Haiti for the verification of human rights. We are honoured to be a sponsor of this initiative, together with the other States promoting it. Here, special mention should be made of the staff of the Mission, which has been performing essential work in monitoring and promoting the normalization in Haiti of the observance of human rights. The Haitian people, under the constitutional presidency of its President elected by popular vote, today enjoys a climate of security unknown until recently. The MICIVIH staff has helped to build that security, especially in those most difficult times when the sole international presence in Haiti was precisely that of the Civilian Mission.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk05-pa07">The recent legislative elections demonstrate in essence the commitment of the Haitian people to the recovery of their democratic institutions. The difficulties encountered mainly concerned formal requirements that it was not possible to observe in their entirety in the voting on 25 June. They should be seen not by comparison with other, well-established democracies, but rather with reference to how things stood in Haiti only a year ago, when democracy had been rejected. Nevertheless, we hope that it may prove possible to correct one by one the formal defects, which cannot detract from the enormous positive development represented by the free expression of the popular will.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk05-pa08">We therefore trust that the presidential elections later this year will serve to consolidate the progress made in strengthening the democratic institutions in Haiti.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk05-pa09">In conclusion, allow me also to emphasize the excellent work done by the International Mission and its positive impact in helping to overcome the Haitian crisis. It remains only for us to express our warm thanks to the international staff of the joint Mission and to encourage them to continue fulfilling their mandate with the same commitment to their work that they have demonstrated in the recent past.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union on agenda item 34, "The situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa02">We have taken note of the letter of President Aristide, dated 23 June 1995, in which he acknowledges the assistance of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti (MICIVIH) and requests the extension of its mandate until 7 February 1996. We also note the observations contained in the report of the Secretary-General of 22 June 1995 (<a href="../pdf/A-49-926.pdf">A/49/926</a>) on the situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti, in which he recommends that the Mission's mandate be extended and that it maintain its present tasks, including those related to the electoral process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa03">The European Union notes with satisfaction the improvement in the human rights situation in Haiti since the deployment of the multinational force, now succeeded by the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), and the restoration of the constitutional Government of President Aristide. The number and seriousness of human rights violations which took place between September 1991 and October 1994, including extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, torture and rape, have fallen dramatically.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa04">The strengthening, if not the outright creation, of institutions essential to the protection of human rights, particularly the civilian police and the judiciary, is the main element of the efforts of the International Mission, in dialogue with the Government of Haiti and in coordination with UNMIH, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Centre for Human Rights and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch of the United Nations Secretariat. We hope that the international community will be as forthcoming in this respect as it has been so far.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa05">The European Union is now looking forward to the continuation of the process of national reconciliation, notably through the ongoing legislative and communal elections and the forthcoming presidential elections and through the work of the National Commission of Truth and Justice.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa06">The first round of the legislative and local elections took place on 25 June 1995 in conditions that, by all available accounts and as was noted by the Electoral Observation Mission of the Organization of American States, allowed the voters to exercise their franchise free from intimidation. We have nonetheless indicated our concern about the many administrative and logistical shortcomings that left a large number of voters unable to exercise their rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa07">However, the fact that Haitians were, for the first time, able to decide their future free from military control, and the reasonable measure of security and freedom in the electoral campaign, cast the ongoing electoral process in an altogether different historical perspective. In the process of institution building, the accountability of local and national structures has to be considered an important achievement. We hope that the serious flaws observed on 25 June can be addressed and remedied in the ongoing process, as well as in the presidential elections at the end of this year, so that the political process can continue on the track it has followed since the return of President Aristide.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa08">The importance of the work being done by the Electoral Observation Mission of the OAS cannot be overemphasized. The European Union, which supported the organization of the election, in particular by offering assistance in its preparation and by dispatching observers, pays tribute to the OAS and the States that are also contributing to the observation process, as well as to the assistance provided by the United Nations system, including the United Nations Mission in Haiti and the International Civilian Mission.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa09">The situation in Haiti has evolved significantly from the days in which the de facto military authorities suppressed the Haitian people, demonstrating wanton disrespect for human life and fundamental human rights. Consequently, the mandate of the Mission to monitor violations of human rights has been supplemented by the provision of assistance in the institutional reconstruction of the country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk03-pa10">The European Union will continue to support ongoing efforts to support the fledgling democracy in Haiti. We consider that the Mission to Haiti will continue to play a very important role in the immediate future. For that reason, the 15 member States of the European Union, which have sponsored draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.67-Rev.1.pdf">A/49/L.67/Rev.1</a>, hope that it will receive the support of the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa01">When the General Assembly met a year ago to renew the mandate of the International Civilian Mission in Haiti, the prospects for the early restoration of democracy and respect for human rights appeared dismal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Since then, the situation has changed completely. President Aristide returned to Haiti on 15 October 1994. With the presence first of the multinational force and now the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), security and stability are being maintained as a new Haitian civilian police force is deployed. On June 25 1995, Haitians participated in the first round of parliamentary and local elections, to be concluded next month. Human rights violations have fallen substantially. Without denying the obstacles ahead, Haitians can look to the future with more hope and less fear.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa03">From the outset, Canada has strongly supported the United Nations efforts to re-establish democracy and promote human rights in Haiti. One of the main elements of these efforts has been the close cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS), of which the creation of the International Civilian Mission has been the most visible result. The Mission has made an outstanding contribution to the achievement of our common objectives.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa04">Throughout the de facto period, the Mission's personnel demonstrated dedication and courage in monitoring the human rights situation under extremely difficult circumstances. Their presence provided the only witness to the abuses of the military dictators. Canada would like to take this occasion to pay tribute to the Mission's members and the work they have accomplished.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa05"><i>(spoke in English)</i></div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa06">While the prospects for Haiti's future have clearly improved, formidable challenges remain. MICIVIH continues to serve an important purpose as Haitians pursue their efforts to build democracy and strengthen respect for human rights. The Mission's human rights role remains vital. In close cooperation with UNMIH and the emerging Haitian police force, the Mission will continue to investigate acts of violence that may have a political motivation and will remain alert to activities that might pose a threat to human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa07">At the same time, MICIVIH, in close association with the Government of Haiti, Haitian non-governmental organizations, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and international donors, will pursue efforts to increase public awareness and strengthen institutions essential to the protection of human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa08">The Mission is also involved in judicial and penal reform, central elements in Haiti's efforts towards national reconciliation and reconstruction. MICIVIH has valuable experience which it is using to assist the Government in judicial training programmes, and it will complement the efforts of others, including Canada, which attach high priority to this area.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa09">Finally, the successful conclusion of parliamentary and local elections next month and the Presidential campaign later this year are fundamental to Haiti's democratic future. MICIVIH was closely involved in the organization and monitoring of the 25 June vote. With the Haitian Electoral Council, United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) and the Organization of American States (OAS), the Mission will continue to play an important role in helping Haitians ensure a free and fair outcome to the electoral process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa10">Canada remains strongly committed to helping Haitians fully establish a peaceful, stable and democratic society based on the full respect of individual rights. We have no doubt about the positive and significant contribution MICIVIH has made in the past and will continue to make over the coming months. Therefore, to this end, we are pleased to co-sponsor the resolution before the General Assembly which will extend MICIVIH's mandate until February 1996.</div>

	Mrs. Albright (United States)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa01">First of all, I should like, on behalf of my Government and the people of the United States of America, to express our sympathy to the Chinese people for the suffering caused by the recent floods. Having recently experienced similar calamities in our own country we are well aware of the consequences of such an event, and the Chinese have our deepest condolences.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa02">I should like to remark today on the courage of the men and women who have committed themselves to the future of Haiti. They include the hundreds of professional human rights monitors of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti (MICIVIH), who have risked their own safety to monitor human rights conditions among the Haitian people. Their work must continue. That is why the United States proudly joined Haiti, Argentina, Canada, France and Venezuela as an original sponsor of the General Assembly resolution we are to adopt here today to extend the Civilian Mission's mandate to 7 February 1996.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Courage also marks the decision of nearly 2 million Haitians to go to the polls on 25 June and join the march towards democracy. They endured a long dry season of tyranny and abuse before the return of President Aristide last year. Since then, challenges have confronted all Haitians in the daily struggle to restore their fragile democracy. One of those challenges -- to register to vote and then vote on 25 June -- required a collective determination on the part of the citizens of Haiti that should humble us all. And the International Civilian Mission no doubt contributed to the people's sense of security on the morning of 25 June.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa04">One year ago, the illegal de facto regime expelled MICIVIH from Haiti. This expulsion was condemned by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 12 July 1994 and was the nadir of the Haitian crisis.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa05">With the restoration last October of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's dry season ended and the planting of lasting democracy began. One hundred and ninety observers of the Civilian Mission, representing 50 nationalities, are helping to promote respect for human rights in Haiti. Their work represents a shining example of effective coordination between the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa06">We not only pay tribute today to the Mission's work since the restoration of democracy to Haiti; we must also honour its valuable work undertaken in difficult and, at times, dangerous circumstances before President Aristide's return.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa07">These efforts in Haiti also signal the broader commitment of the international community, spearheaded by the United Nations, to building democracy. The effort has been comprehensive. It involves human rights monitors and peace-keepers, as well as the restoration of international financial institutions and United Nations specialized agencies. Coordination among the various actors in this cause has been nothing short of extraordinary, and we commend them all.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa08">We can point proudly to the Civilian Mission's participation in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Haiti, the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), UNDP, the Centre for Human Rights and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch of the Secretariat to strengthen institutions in Haiti essential to the protection of human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa09">Thanks to these efforts, since President Aristide's return, the number of human rights violations in Haiti has fallen substantially: free expression is now the norm and mistreatment of prisoners is the exception.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa10">But there has been politically motivated violence -- namely, the murders of a former member of the Chamber of Deputies and of a former chief of staff in the de facto Government. We support the Civilian Mission's continued role in investigating politically motivated violence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa11">We agree with the Secretary-General that the main impediment to full respect for human rights in Haiti is the alarming weakness in the judicial system and the absence of a fully operational civilian force. President Aristide has expressed similar concerns. The recent deployment of 700 members of the new Haitian National Police (HNP) and continuing efforts in Haiti to train new judicial personnel are important first steps. My Government is much involved with these programmes, and we join the Secretary-General in his recent call for increased participation by others.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa12">The elections held on 25 June were an important milestone for Haitian democracy. The electoral contests involved 2,200 offices, over 10,000 candidates and the registration of over 3 million voters. Balloting was almost uniformly peaceful. Most contests took place without serious incident. International observers saw few examples of electoral fraud and no evidence of any large-scale or systematic effort to subvert the elections or skew the results.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa13">However, in many cases the process was, in the words of one observer, "free, fair and fouled up". Some candidates were prevented from running, and some voters were prevented from voting. But these problems do not appear to have been the result of partisan motivation or to have worked to the advantage of any particular party.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa14">We should not be surprised that freely electing over 2,000 local and national officials in the poorest, least educated, most politically volatile nation in the Western Hemisphere -- a country without adequate roads, electricity, administrators or democratic tradition -- should prove to be such a daunting task.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa15">Extraordinary measures were taken by the Haitian election authorities to facilitate informed choice and promote broad participation of candidates, parties and voters. Few electoral systems anywhere in the world have gone to such lengths to assure independent candidates and small parties an equal place on the ballot. The complexity of this ambitious attempt itself became the source of complaint. Ten thousand polling places were set up in a country largely devoid of infrastructure. Forty thousand poll workers were hired. The scope of these preparations challenged the Haitian electoral authorities and in some cases overwhelmed them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa16">Our task is now threefold: to encourage the people of Haiti to remain committed to the electoral process, to encourage Haiti's electoral authorities to improve that process and to encourage Haiti's political parties -- whether they be the losers or the winners this time around -- to stay in the game. Most importantly, we must help strengthen the mechanisms needed to make sure that this milestone leads to a duly constituted and freely elected system of government.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa17">The role of MICIVIH in this effort is important. It appealed to all political parties and candidates and the appropriate authorities to do all in their power to ensure that elections took place in a peaceful atmosphere. As Haiti continues its electoral process, representatives of my Government and of the Friends of Haiti have joined with the United Nations and the OAS to address deficiencies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa18">We are all working to ensure that the second round of local and legislative elections will be more effectively managed than the first and that the Presidential elections scheduled for the end of this year will achieve a still higher standard. This is but the latest example of sustained international cooperation for Haiti. We must remain fully committed to helping Haiti down the road to democracy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa19">Such continued and comprehensive efforts between the international community and the Government of Haiti are crucial for meeting the challenge. As President Aristide said in his letter of 23 June 1995 to the Secretary-General, these efforts</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg015-bk01-pa20">"will have to be maintained and reinforced if respect for the rights of the individual in Haiti is to become firmly entrenched." (<i><a href="../pdf/A-49-926.pdf">A/49/926</a>, annex, second paragraph</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa21">It will be a long road, and our renewal of the mandate of MICIVIH today is another step forward in this historic endeavour. Our destination is clear and within reach: a democratic and independent Haiti, where peace is sustained, human rights are respected, and prosperity possible.</div>

	Mr. Rodrigue (Haiti)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa01">My delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for his very detailed report on the human rights situation in Haiti and on the activities conducted by the International Civilian Mission to Haiti (MICIVIH) to promote respect for human rights in my country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa02">We recall that the Mission is a joint operation between the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations, created at the request of President Aristide in order to ensure respect for human rights, which had regularly been flouted under the military regime.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa03">During the period of the <i>coup d'état </i>the Mission accomplished outstanding, praiseworthy work in extremely difficult conditions. The members of the Mission were able to learn of many and varied violations of individual rights committed with utter impunity by the military and its civilian allies against the Haitian populace. They were able to denounce these acts publicly and intervene with the authorities on the spot to put an end to those violations. The personnel of MICIVIH took enormous risks to ensure the defence of the oppressed Haitian people, and the Haitian Government wishes to pay a well-deserved tribute to the men and women whose presence in Haiti served not only as a deterrent but, above all, represented the only recourse for a population abandoned to the wrath of the military. The military tired of these bothersome witnesses, eventually expelled the Mission from Haiti so that it could do its dirty work unfettered by international public opinion.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa04">With the return of President Aristide and the restoration of constitutional order in Haiti, MICIVIH has been able to resume its activities of observation and defence of human rights. To these primary activities we must add its participation in the elections taking place in Haiti. In this regard, MICIVIH is without a doubt an important element in the efforts being made within the country to consolidate the democracy that the Haitian people have valiantly fought to establish.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa05">My Government, aware that respect for the fundamental rights of all citizens is an essential condition for the establishment of a genuine democracy and a state of law, is firmly determined to set up the structures necessary for the protection of civil liberties. A far-reaching reform of the judicial system has been undertaken in order to enable it to dispense true justice to the people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa06">Similarly, the Government has launched an educational campaign for the people in order to promote respect for the fundamental human rights of all citizens. The establishment of the police corps for the purpose of ensuring the protection of the population is another measure undertaken by the Government in the area of respect for human rights. The first police officers to graduate from the police academy have already been deployed in the capital and can be credited with having contributed to a reduction in the crime rate there.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa07">Mention must also be made of the establishment of the National Commission of Truth and Justice, whose mandate is to investigate serious violations of human rights committed between 30 September 1991 and 15 October 1994.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa08">In these areas, and other areas, MICIVIH is present and is providing very useful cooperation in the form of advice, ideas or recommendations, for which my Government is grateful and from which it hopes to continue to benefit. My delegation is therefore pleased in advance at the decision to be taken by the General Assembly to authorize the extension of the mandate of the United Nations component of MICIVIH and wishes to express its thanks to the delegations that have worked with us to achieve this objective.</div>
