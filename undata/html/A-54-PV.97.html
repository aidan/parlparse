	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa01">I wish to inform Member States that, should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.85.pdf">A/54/L.85</a>, under operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would decide to convene a Second World Assembly on Ageing in 2002 devoted to an overall review of the outcome of the First World Assembly on Ageing, as well as to the adoption of a revised plan of action and a long-term strategy on ageing. Implementation of the requests contained in this operative paragraph, in particular the costs for the convening of the Second World Assembly on Ageing, would be included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa02">In operative paragraph 3, the General Assembly would accept the offer of the Government of Spain and decide that the Second World Assembly on Ageing would be held in Spain in April 2002. Should the General Assembly accept the offer of the Government of Spain to host the Second World Assembly on Ageing, in accordance with paragraph 5 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-40-243.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 40/243</a>, the difference in costs between New York and Spain would be borne by the host Government.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa03">In operative paragraph 6, the Commission for Social Development would serve as the preparatory committee for the Second World Assembly on Ageing and be open to participation of all Member States of the United Nations, members of the specialized agencies and observers, in accordance with the established practice of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa04">There is provision in the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 for substantive and conference servicing of the Commission for Social Development at its thirty-ninth and fortieth sessions. The provision contained in operative paragraph 6 would imply the servicing of two sessions of the preparatory committee, one in 2001 and the other 2002, and would require the provision of conference servicing, including interpretation in all six languages, the translation, editing and publishing of the associated documentation in all of the languages, estimated at $169,000 per session.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa05">Provision has been made in the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 not only for meetings programmed at the time of the budget preparation, but also for meetings authorized subsequently, provided that the number and distribution of meetings are consistent with the pattern of meetings of past years. Consequently, no additional resources would be needed for the conference servicing for the meetings of the preparatory committee in 2001. The resource requirements for the preparatory committee in 2002 would be included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa06">Under operative paragraphs 8 and 9, the Secretary-General would be invited to establish a technical committee, funded through voluntary contributions and composed of experts geographically balanced to assist in the formulation of proposals during the preparatory process.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa07">In operative paragraph 12, the General Assembly would encourage voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund on Ageing to support preparatory activities of the Second World Assembly, including the participation of least developed countries.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa08">The requests contained in operative paragraphs 8 and 12 will be carried out through funding from voluntary contributions. It is anticipated that voluntary contributions will be forthcoming to support the requests.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa09">As regards the use of voluntary contributions to support the participation of least developed countries in the Second World Assembly, it should be noted that this would imply an exception to the provision of General Assembly resolution 1798 (XVII) of 11 December 1962 on the payment of travel and subsistence allowances to members of organs and subsidiary organs of the United Nations. In addition, it is the understanding of the Secretariat that the support to be provided to least developed countries would consist of the payment from extra-budgetary resources of the travel cost for one representative from each least developed country to attend the Second World Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg002-bk06-pa10">In summary, should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, no additional requirements would arise under the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV97-pg004-bk01-pa01">The European Union welcomes the adoption today by the General Assembly of the two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child: on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. We hope that those two legal instruments will become important tools for the promotion and protection of the human rights of all children around the world.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg004-bk01-pa02">The optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, which implements some fundamental principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, represents a significant step towards improving the standards of protection accorded to children against those heinous practices of exploitation. Our goal is to eliminate those practices, and we stand ready to support further efforts to combat any practices that violate the rights of the child in this field.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg004-bk01-pa03">The optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict also constitutes a fundamental complement to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and especially so at a time when we are experiencing an increasing number of armed conflicts in which children are increasingly targeted and brutalized, with very negative consequences for their living conditions and for their enjoyment of their human rights.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg004-bk01-pa04">The European Union would like to extend to all those who participated in the work of the two drafting groups its appreciation for the remarkable spirit of cooperation and the constructive approach they demonstrated, which allowed us to achieve this successful outcome.

	<p id="docA54PV97-pg004-bk02-pa02">First, Sweden understands the word "representation" in the definition of child pornography in article 2 (c) to cover only visual representation.

	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk03-pa03">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk03-pa04">May I also remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk03-pa05">Before we begin to take action on the recommendation contained in the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take a decision in the same manner as was done in the Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified to the contrary in advance.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk03-pa06">We shall now take a decision on the draft resolution contained in paragraph 9 of the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-577-Add.1.pdf">A/54/577/Add.1</a>.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk04-pa01">We support the draft resolution before us today, which, among other things, welcomes and endorses the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. We note the valuable role of the Special Committee in identifying practical measures to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to conduct peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk04-pa02">We would also like to thank the Chairman of the Special Committee and the Chairman of the working group for their efforts this spring.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk04-pa03">In the light of the challenges facing United Nations peacekeeping efforts throughout the world today, we would like to underscore, as stated in the report, that</p>
	<blockquote id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk04-pa04">"the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be in an effective position to maintain international peace and security,  <i>inter alia,</i> by improving the capacity to assess conflict situations, by effective planning and management of peacekeeping operations, and by responding quickly and effectively to any Security Council mandate." <i>(<a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-839.pdf">A/54/839</a>, para. 47)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk04-pa05">To this end, we applaud the report's call for improving planning and management of peacekeeping operations, building capacity for rapid deployment and shortening procurement times for vital resources. We also support the report's call for the replenishment of the logistics base in Brindisi and, in particular, the call for a comprehensive review of all elements within the Secretariat that play a role in peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk04-pa06">We regret that the Special Committee could not reach agreement on other issues, which we believe would assist the United Nations in efficiently and effectively deploying peacekeepers. These issues include the use of Gratis Type II Personnel, the development of a roster system and the strengthening of the standby arrangements system. We look forward to working to build a consensus on these proposals in the future.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV97-pg005-bk04-pa07">Peacekeeping operational reform is a top priority for my Government, and we therefore call for further discussion and work on these issues relating to peacekeeping early in the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We would also consider supporting a reconvening of the Special Committee to discuss important peacekeeping issues, including the results of the Secretary-General's panel on peace operations.</p>
