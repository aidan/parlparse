	Mr. Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Bulgaria)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">A year after the unique Millennium Assembly, we can say that the United Nations is playing an enhanced, more important role as a collective tool for meeting the challenges facing the world.</div>
	<div class="p">Bulgaria welcomes the re-election of Mr. Kofi Annan as Secretary-General, and hails the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and to the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p">International terrorism has become aggressive and powerful, and threatens not only States but also the freedom of the human spirit, as proved by the world Organization's committed and active stance vis-à-vis recent terrorist acts, along with the unanimously adopted Security Council resolutions condemning them. Bulgaria unequivocally supported those resolutions, in particular Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The National Assembly and the Government of Bulgaria have adopted similar declarations on ensuring a common effort in the fight against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me recall that the fight will be incomplete without moral -- even spiritual -- commitment. Let us not forget that the mere pursuit of material well-being is not a panacea; other values are needed to improve the lives of peoples. In a "virtual society", there is a need for real values and for a framework acceptable to both the poor and the rich.</div>
	<div class="p">I take this opportunity to convey the condolences of the Bulgarian people to the citizens of the United States of America with respect to the terrorist acts of 11 September. We all admire the steadfastness and courage they have displayed in addressing this tragedy and its aftermath.</div>
	<div class="p">I am particularly proud to observe that, at a time when the role and the importance of the United Nations are on the rise, the Republic of Bulgaria is about to assume the responsibilities of a non-permanent member of the Security Council. For the Bulgarian people and its Government, our election to that important organ of the world Organization constitutes recognition of the international standing of Bulgaria and of its active, balanced foreign policy. Our foreign policy priorities -- membership of the European Union and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- are sounder than ever before. For natural cultural reasons, we are committed to the concept of <i>la francophonie</i>, which embodies not merely a language but a state of mind. I thank all Member States that were good enough to support us in the election.</div>
	<div class="p">Bulgaria will shoulder the full responsibility of non-permanent membership of the Security Council. We are ready to participate in dialogue on the full range of items related to the maintenance of international peace and security. My country is open to dialogue with all States Members of the Organization and to ideas and suggestions aimed at enhancing the role and effectiveness of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish here to speak of the positive part the Republic of Bulgaria plays as an important actor for peace and security in South-Eastern Europe and for stability in the settlement of crises in the Eastern Balkans, an area that borders on Bulgaria. We favour full implementation of Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1244-1999">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, and we consider that the 17 November elections in Kosovo will be decisive for the process of stabilization and democratization there. Similarly, Bulgaria attaches high importance to ensuring the stability of the Republic of Macedonia through the implementation of the 13 August 2001 Framework Agreement and to guaranteeing its sovereignty and territorial integrity. My country supports full implementation of the Dayton Accords and the consolidation of the united State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In our view, democratization in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a positive element. A long-term strategy must be crafted to effect the restoration and economic development of South-Eastern Europe to rebuild it in the wake of the various crises it has experienced. Let me stress that these questions should continue to be the focus of all our efforts to find equitable solutions to conflicts.</div>

	Mr. Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Bulgaria)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I should like also to highlight Bulgaria's support for the lasting and peaceful settlement of other regional conflicts that are as tragic as those in the Middle East, in Africa and elsewhere, of which there is a long and sad list. Our positions in respect to all of these conflicts are in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and generally recognized principles of international law.</div>
	<div class="p">Having myself been an exile for more than 50 years, I am very aware of the human tragedy of refugees, whose number and suffering are continuing to increase, as is the case now in Afghanistan.</div>
	<div class="p">We attach great importance to items on the agenda of the United Nations such as the combat against organized crime and corruption and against illegal drug trafficking. That is why our Government is making a particular effort to this end on our own territory. Monitoring trade in weapons and in dual-use goods and technologies is highly relevant, given the linkage between this kind of trade and terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me add that Bulgaria is participating actively in cooperation efforts in the economic and social field and in the areas of human rights, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, global disarmament and the protection of the environment. These objectives are consonant with those of the new Bulgarian Government: to ensure that the social needs of Bulgarian citizens are met, and to bring about durable economic growth, despite the sometimes difficult international economic situation.</div>
	<div class="p">The attitude of the Republic of Bulgaria vis-à-vis its increased responsibilities within this world Organization will be based on a clear, logical and consistent foreign policy, with an emphasis on regional security, development and broadening the circle of friendly States, and on making a contribution to the resolution of global problems through its active participation in multilateral dialogue. Solutions to conflicts must be found here, at the United Nations -- not on the battlefield.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, we believe that this policy will meet with the understanding and support of all of the Members of the United Nations.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I give the floor to His Excellency Mr. José Miguel Alemán, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Panama.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="3-3">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Alemán" nation="Panama" language="Spanish">
	Mr. Alemán (Panama)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The Republic of Panama welcomes with particular pleasure the election of Mr. Han Seung-soo as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and wishes to assure him of our fullest cooperation in the sensitive work with which he is entrusted. It is also a pleasure for us to express the deep satisfaction of the Government of Panama at the well-deserved honour of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and to the Organization itself.</div>
	<div class="p">As we participate today in this forum, we are still reeling from the impact of the terrifying terrorist acts carried out on 11 September in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. These crimes against humanity will never be forgotten, and, as a tribute to the thousands of innocent victims of these senseless attacks, the United Nations must take whatever measures are necessary to legitimize any multilateral action that will have to be taken in future to neutralize the threat of international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The Republic of Panama, as a State Member of the United Nations, fully respects the mandates issued by the Organization, and, therefore, we are pleased to state here unambiguously that every resource available to us has been directed to fulfil our responsibilities in the war against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Similarly, we support the Security Council Committee set up under <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, chaired by the Ambassador of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Sir Jeremy Greenstock. We propose to remain in communication with him on an ongoing basis.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Panama, under the leadership of President Mireya Moscoso, is prepared vigorously to implement the provisions contained in all United Nations instruments on international terrorism. To that end, we will soon submit to our Legislative Assembly the four United Nations instruments that have not yet been ratified by our country, together with the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism of December 1999, which we have just signed here. Likewise, we will ratify, as soon as possible, the Rome Statute creating the International Criminal Court.</div>
	<div class="p">In parallel with the joint actions taken against terrorism in conformity with the many relevant United Nations Conventions and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, and in order to address terrorist activities, we respectfully appeal to all to set aside any differences that may have arisen in July in respect of the problem of massive illegal trade in small arms and light weapons. It is well known that the ultimate beneficiaries of this deadly traffic are not only rebel movements -- sometimes sponsored by other nations -- but also notorious terrorist groups. That is why Panama reiterates the position it maintained during the Conference: that no State has the right to promote this deadly traffic by claiming its own national interests are at stake. This issue must be re-examined in the light of recent events.</div>
	<div class="p">The Republic of Panama is particularly concerned at the social, political and economic implications of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and wishes to declare its commitment to promoting an American convention on this question, with a view to creating a legal framework that will enable the countries of the hemisphere to completely suppress this traffic and thus strengthen regional security.</div>
	<div class="p">We are caught up in a vortex of bloodshed that brings us ever closer to generalized conflagrations. The States represented here, when we became Members of this Organization, undertook formally to promote peace and human rights; to meet the food, health care and educational needs of our peoples; to preserve the environment; and to bring about overall social, economic and political development.</div>
	<div class="p">However, for this commitment to have a real effect, we must secure the support of those States that, due to pure fanaticism, particularly in the Middle East, have not been able to come to terms with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. My country believes that the intolerance and intransigence demonstrated in that part of the world are the result of ancient ways of thinking and injustices that can be easily discerned and which constitute flagrant violations of the United Nations Charter. The Republic of Panama has repeatedly urged the parties in conflict to renounce the use of force, re-establish cooperation on security and adopt measures to restore mutual trust, which enable a return to the peace process based on the norms of international law.</div>
	<div class="p">In recent days, the international community has witnessed with deep sadness the intensification of violence in that region. Because of the brutality occurring in the Middle East, Panama considers that it is the responsibility of the United Nations to vigorously strengthen its mediating role in order to put an end to the unfortunate bloodshed that has grieved the international community for decades.</div>
	<div class="p">In particular, Panama calls on the Security Council to assume a more active role in the efforts to apply the recommendations of the Mitchell report, which proposes using constructive dialogue and mutual concessions to move beyond the violence. An indispensable step is recognizing the right of the Palestinian people to create a sovereign State and the right of the State of Israel to live in peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p">We must make our best effort, employ our most outstanding human resources and put ourselves to the task of reconciling all humankind. The Republic of Panama will persist in this task and will always advocate peaceful solutions to conflicts through dialogue and the rejection of violence as the means to resolve internal or international disputes.</div>
	<div class="p">Other examples of situations that cause unnecessary friction and that could be resolved through dialogue are the issues of the Saharan people's right to self-determination, the Argentine Republic's claim to the Falkland Islands, and the representation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the United Nations system while the internal situation of that fraternal people is being resolved.</div>
	<div class="p">Panama defends human rights without reservation and will never accept acts which violate them, wherever the violations occur and whatever the circumstances used to try to justify those violations.</div>
	<div class="p">Let us add to this very clear position of ours our sincere commitment to the universal campaign for the rights of the child and to the fight against HIV/AIDS, as these are an essential part of human rights. On this latter issue, Panama considers that the key to any future success lies in everyone's acceptance of their economic and social responsibilities with respect to this terrible disease and in developing good community planning at the local and provincial levels to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</div>
	<div class="p">Human rights are clearly defined in the political and civil spheres as much as in the economic, social and cultural spheres. Since the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December 1948, much progress has been made. However, the principles proclaimed on that occasion are being challenged by the inequalities of globalization and financing for development, by unpayable foreign debts and by the indiscriminate destruction of the environment. All these factors of extreme poverty require acts of profound solidarity on behalf of the richer nations. We firmly believe that the eradication of poverty and inequality will prevent the erosion of human rights and halt the social upheavals that generate violence and cause the loss of the political, social and economic rights of the citizens of the world.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, was a tremendous effort towards sustainable world development. The most important outcome of the Conference was the adoption of Agenda 21, which covers in depth the topics of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and the progressive deterioration of ecosystems. Agenda 21 also encourages us to focus our attention on the financial resources required to promote sustainable development at the national level, with the goal of creating a corresponding measurement system for it that can be easily interpreted. This is an ongoing and important task that we cannot neglect.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations Conference on Financing for Development will be held in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002. We believe that the Conference offers a magnificent opportunity to reduce the abyss between the rich countries of the North and the poor countries of the South in both the practical and conceptual aspects of this issue.</div>
	<div class="p">In the course of last month's meetings of the Conference's Preparatory Committee, opinions with substantial differences were expressed, and these must be reconciled. As a result of these disagreements, there have been pessimistic predictions that it will be impossible to formulate a plan of action at Monterrey. I believe, on the contrary, that since we already know the objections that will be made by those who assume the risks of financing, we cannot delay revising our arguments, in order -- creatively and responsibly -- to define parameters for financing for development that are more in tune with the realities of today's world.</div>
	<div class="p">The current realities are pressing and encompass, among other things, the need to provide financing at discounted rates to developing countries; to vigorously attack the problem of foreign debt; to design measures to raise the depressed prices of our raw materials and other export products; and to agree collectively on mechanisms to prevent financial crises.</div>
	<div class="p">Following this line of thought, and because we consider it of interest to the General Assembly, we will mention that in June of this year the Central American countries and the United States signed a joint declaration under the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America (ALIDES). This alliance is a regional strategy to make the Central American isthmus a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development. Its general objectives include the sustainable management of biodiversity, the strengthening and modernization of institutional structures, the promotion of trade and the mitigation of natural disasters.</div>
	<div class="p">Specifically, ALIDES works for regional economic integration and the region's integration in the international economy; the harmonization of macroeconomic policies and the modernization of infrastructure in the areas of energy, transportation and telecommunications; the creation of protected biological corridors, river basins and other areas; the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law in the region; the improvement of the levels of education, health and security of the population of Central America; and the restoration and preservation of national values.</div>
	<div class="p">Central America's desire for development has been strengthened by the launching of the Puebla-Panama Plan. We created for the region a mechanism for ongoing and permanent consultation to perfect an integral strategy for long-term development.</div>
	<div class="p">While we are making great efforts to mitigate the social problems that afflict us in some regions, in the United Nations we continue to debate structural problems that limit to some extent the ability of many of our countries to have an effect on the administration of the Organization. Among the different debates relating to United Nations reform, we would like to refer to the one held on 30 October on agenda item 49, entitled "Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and related matters". Last year the delegation of Panama, both at the Millennium Summit and the General Assembly, supported the aspiration of many years to bring about the reform of the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p">We have said -- and we wish to repeat today -- that we agree it must have a more equitable and more representative composition, but in order to achieve this fundamental objective it is indispensable that the permanent members accept that the power structure of 1945 has ceased to exist. Now, looking at the new and vital interdependence of all nations around the world, we see a genuine opportunity opening before us to get rid of the obsessions that no longer suit the structure of our Organization.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, we would like to restate our conviction that, as we have seen after the horrendous terrorist acts of 11 September, the legitimacy and effectiveness of future Security Council actions will depend on all Member States feeling the absence of unilateral measures and of the usual marginalization in decision-making on matters affecting all of us. It is in this direction that we should guide our work.</div>

	<div class="p">I now call on His Excellency the Honourable Motsoahae Thomas Thabane, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lesotho.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="5-9">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Thabane" nation="Lesotho" language="">
	Mr. Thabane (Lesotho)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On behalf of the delegation of Lesotho, allow me, through you, Sir, to congratulate the President and other members of the Bureau on their election to office during this fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Allow me also to pay a well deserved tribute to Mr. Harri Holkeri, President of the fifty-fifth session, and to commend him for spearheading efforts to reform and revitalize the General Assembly, with a view to strengthening its role as the chief deliberative policy-making and representative body of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">We congratulate our Secretary-General for winning the Nobel Peace Prize and for his reappointment as head of the Organization. This will no doubt enable him to continue his efforts to make the United Nations more relevant in facing today's challenges. We commend him for continuing to place such a high premium on the need for the Organization to develop better tools for conflict prevention, management and resolution and encourage him to continue developing concepts and strategic frameworks for the Organization's activities in the areas of conflict prevention and peace-building.</div>
	<div class="p">We particularly wish to commend the Secretary-General for his relentless efforts and commitment to reforming and transforming the United Nations into a functioning Organization with a new management culture. We reiterate the view shared by many in this Assembly that the United Nations would be more democratic if the Security Council were made more representative of the membership as a whole. Regrettably, while we all agree on the need for reform, agreement on the details for such reform continues to elude us.</div>
	<div class="p">Lesotho reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of the barbaric acts of terror committed against innocent civilians on 11 September and extends its condolences to the relatives of all those who perished during the attacks. Ideological or other differences are no excuse for such unspeakable acts; neither can such evil acts be justified on the grounds of expediency. Those responsible for these acts must be punished. While we support the international coalition against terrorism and consider ourselves part thereof, we nevertheless stress the need for capacity-building to enable all countries effectively to play their part in combating this menace.</div>
	<div class="p">One year after the unprecedented Millennium Summit is now a good time for us to reflect and take stock of how we are responding to the challenges and changes brought about by our ever growing interdependence and the ever-increasing interconnectedness of our economies. In this changing world in which all forms of economic, social, cultural and political activity have become dependent on access to telecommunications and information services provided by the global information infrastructure, what progress have we made towards making globalization truly global and ensuring that people everywhere share in its benefits?</div>
	<div class="p">The truth of the matter is that there remains a gaping digital chasm between the industrialized and the developing countries, especially in Africa where the majority of the people are yet to reap the benefits of information and communications technology. Much still needs to be done to jump-start the introduction of information and communications technology in primary schools in order to enable the developing countries to respond to the changing needs of society and the economy.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations system thus has to redouble its efforts in assisting developing countries, particularly in Africa, in building their capacity in curriculum development to ensure improvements in the quality of education and access to information and communications technology, including through the transfer of technology. We thus call upon all international partners to treat information and communications technology as a special priority for Africa's development.</div>
	<div class="p">Despite the many difficulties that the developing countries continue to face in addressing their urgent development needs, solid progress is being made towards establishing strong institutional capacities for sustainable development, including a sound macroeconomic foundation, effective governance, peace and stability. Following many years of undemocratic military dictatorships and coups d'état in Africa, the continent has begun to take bold steps to climb out of the rut, and today strong winds of democracy continue to reverberate throughout. This deepening of democratic principles has led Africans to shun all leaders who come to power through extra-constitutional means. There is also a growing awareness within Africa that sustainable development cannot take place in the midst of actual or potential conflict and that armed conflict is retrogressive and inevitably destroys the achievements of many years of national development; hence, conflict management is now assuming greater importance in Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">Development is also beginning to take firm roots as many African countries formulate their development strategies and pursue greater cooperative relations with their development partners. The key role played by the United Nations in helping to re-energize the momentum for international partnership between, in particular, the least developed countries and the international community will remain crucial for addressing poverty and sustainable development.</div>
	<div class="p">Africa is not only determined to overcome its problems, but it is also determined to ensure that the future development of the continent is shaped and designed by Africans themselves. Many of the evils that have continued to plague Africa, including economic decline, internal unrest and civil wars, uncertainty, corruption and disintegration of States, have been major obstacles to the development and establishment of viable societies in Africa. All this has made us realize that the only way to achieve sustainable development for the continent is to ensure that people live and work in stable conditions under the rule of law. Transforming the Organization of African Unity (OAU) into the African Union should thus be seen as an important step that will pave the way for the establishment of strong institutions endowed with necessary powers and resources to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities efficiently and effectively.</div>
	<div class="p">It is against this background that the launching of the New African Initiative in Lusaka in July was also a turning point in Africa's efforts aimed at ensuring that appropriate Africa-wide and regional economic and social reforms are carried out with a view to eradicating all social injustices. This African-owned and African-led economy-centred recovery programme and framework for action is a pragmatic vision of how Africa wishes to be included as a partner and not as a recipient of the benefits and opportunities offered by globalization. This initiative by Africans, which sets out the right priorities and focal points for the sustainable development of the African continent, deserves not only commendation, but also support from this Assembly and the international community as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p">In embarking on this new path to recovery, Africans have no illusions. They are fully aware of the mammoth task that they have set for themselves and believe that progress towards achieving it will have to be driven by the people and Governments of Africa themselves. We will have to create the necessary conditions to allow the poor to become agents of change, using their own talents and capacities to raise their production and increase their income.</div>
	<div class="p">For all that to happen, Africa needs resources. The international community must provide support not only through development cooperation, but also through improved trade access for African countries to the markets of the developed world. The "Everything but Arms" initiative adopted by the European Council of Ministers in February is a first important step towards scrapping customs duties on imports from Africa and other developing countries, and needs to be emulated. We express our gratitude for the support and commitment already given to this initiative by the G-8 and the European Union and call upon other donor countries and agencies to join Africa as it embarks on its new path of recovery. In the same vein, we acknowledge the benefits that the African Growth and Opportunity Act holds for sub-Saharan African countries.</div>
	<div class="p">The Millennium Summit reaffirmed the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development goal of reducing by half the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015. Despite that, abject poverty, a narrow resource base and, hence, broad dependence on overseas development aid, unsustainable levels of debt and the deleterious effects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic continue to be part of everyday reality for the majority of the people in the world. In some regions of sub-Saharan Africa poverty has actually increased, posing a serious threat to democratic governance processes through the erosion of human rights and human dignity, as well as the deterioration of the already narrow natural resource base. In addition, the number of least developed countries has more than doubled since 1971, when the United Nations set up that category of countries.</div>
	<div class="p">A more rapid and sustainable exit from debt is thus imperative. This calls for urgent implementation of an enhanced and expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC). It further calls for more comprehensive measures, including converting the remaining bilateral debts of the least developed countries into grants, widening HIPC to benefit more countries, increasing the levels of official development assistance, ensuring markets for the products of least developed countries and encouraging greater volumes of foreign direct investment to Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">Lesotho therefore looks forward to further discussion of these measures during the coming International Conference on Financing for Development, the convening of which we fully support. We also believe that the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 is a benchmark framework for accelerating the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the poorest and weakest segment of the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">Housing remains a critical pillar of sustainable economic development. It is the single most important and obvious indicator of individual aspirations and their fulfilment. Testimony to this is the renewal of our commitment, earlier this year, to the principles of the Habitat Agenda, which are encapsulated in the ideas of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements for development. Poverty continues to be a major factor for developing countries' failure to realize these twin goals of the Habitat Agenda.</div>
	<div class="p">In the same vein, a healthy population is an absolute requirement for social and economic development. We thus recognize the enormous challenges posed by HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. For Africa, which is host to 70 per cent of the people infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide, this scourge is reversing hard-won gains in economic and social development. Political commitment and leadership are therefore essential for building national capacities to develop and implement comprehensive national strategies for HIV/AIDS prevention, care, support and treatment, all of which require mobilization of resources. We therefore welcome the outcome of the special session on HIV/AIDS held during the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, and hope that the Global AIDS and Health Fund announced by the Secretary-General will soon become operational to provide funding on a grant basis to the most affected countries.</div>
	<div class="p">Lesotho welcomes the global movement to ensure that every child enjoys a better beginning, and hence a better future, and has undertaken to renew its commitment to ensure the rights of children. Our most auspicious endeavour to that end was the progressive introduction, in the year 2000, of free primary education beginning with standard 1 pupils. We believe that this is a step forward in ensuring sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. The new agreed dates for the postponed children's summit should ensure that we do not lose the momentum for creating a better world for children.</div>
	<div class="p">Lesotho also remains keenly aware of the important role that women play in the advancement of the nation's social and economic development processes, as well as of the need to sustain their involvement and participation at all levels. To that end, we have heeded the call to States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women that have entered reservations to the Convention to review those reservations. Our own reservation to the Convention has been amended with a view to withdrawing it at a later stage.</div>
	<div class="p">The events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, as well as the gruesome images of women and children whose limbs were hacked off by rebel forces in Sierra Leone, have shown that accountability for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and universal jurisdiction over those crimes, are key to bringing an end to the cycle of impunity that we have witnessed over the years. Lesotho's tangible contribution towards ending the culture of impunity is demonstrated by its support and assistance to the activities of the International Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda aimed at bringing those responsible for the most egregious crimes to justice, as well as its support for the creation of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, for which Lesotho has pledged $100,000 over three years. The first payment of $40,000 in respect of the first year has already been deposited. We call on the international community to provide adequate funding in order that the Special Court for Sierra Leone may come into operation.</div>
	<div class="p">While the pace of ratifications for the Statute of the International Criminal Court is encouraging, more needs to be done if that Court is to become a reality soon. Adequate time and resources should therefore be made available for the Preparatory Commission to fulfil its mandate within the first half of 2002.</div>
	<div class="p">International peace and security continue to be a major challenge for the United Nations in the twenty-first century. While some positive developments have been recorded on various issues that are critical to the security of the international community, much more still needs to be done in pursuit of a more peaceful world -- a world free from weapons of mass destruction; a world free from the arsenals of illicit small arms and light weapons; and a world with strengthened global norms for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.</div>
	<div class="p">We renew our call to those who remain outside the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to join the Treaty, and urge the nuclear-weapon States to continue full compliance with obligations assumed under the Treaty.</div>
	<div class="p">The recent spate of biowarfare threats have also heightened the urgent need to devise effective compliance measures that will make the proliferation of biological weapons much harder and prevent such weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist groups.</div>
	<div class="p">The historic United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects has succeeded in highlighting the human suffering and insecurity engendered by the excessive accumulation and illicit transfer of those weapons. Though not fully satisfactory, particularly to those of us who have suffered most from this scourge, the measures envisaged in the Programme of Action are a historic first step towards curbing this menace. It is now up to all of us to forge meaningful partnerships to ensure effective implementation of the Programme as we move together to free the world of these weapons.</div>
	<div class="p">While peace has continued to hold in many regions of the world, Africa has experienced setbacks in that regard, as violent conflicts have continued unabated. The sad legacy of our colonial past, wherein State-sponsored activities facilitated the systematic plunder of Africa's resources, have been replaced by foreign companies and individuals in pursuit of the so-called bottom line, whose sole motive is the maximization of profit. The link between conflicts, the easy availability of arms, an abundance of natural resources and the greed of these individuals have totally devalued African lives. In other words, the worth of African lives in the year 2001 is much the same as during the time of slavery in the nineteenth century. We call upon the same collective conscience of the international community that condemned and succeeded in eradicating slavery to speak with equal vehemence against this evil in our time.</div>
	<div class="p">The volatile and explosive situation in the Middle East remains highly regrettable. Lesotho supports the creation of an independent Palestinian State on the basis of Security Council resolutions, a State that should coexist in peace with its neighbours.</div>
	<div class="p">We call on all parties to conflicts around the world to intensify efforts to create conditions conducive to the implementation of the agreements reached and relevant Security Council resolutions, as well as to the effective engagement of the United Nations. We are encouraged by the developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Sierra Leone, and applaud the efforts of all parties to bring peace to their countries.</div>
	<div class="p">We are, however, saddened by the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements relating to the settlement, once and for all, of two of the largest running conflicts, in Angola and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic. We in Lesotho are convinced that the Houston accords remain the foundation for self-determination in the latter, while, undoubtedly, the Lusaka Protocol on Angola remains the only viable basis for peace in that sisterly country.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, Lesotho renews its commitment to multilateral cooperation and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The current difficult times call for the strong support of the United Nations and the multilateral processes if the Organization is to effectively address the new global issues and challenges that confront it.</div>

</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="9-8">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Mezode" nation="Central African Republic" language="French">
	Mr. Mezode (Central African Republic)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The delegation of the Central African Republic would like first of all to fulfil the task entrusted to it by His Excellency Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé, President of the Republic and head of State, of expressing the solidarity of the Central African Republic with the American people, as well as its resolute condemnation of the heinous acts committed against freedom, democracy and peace on 11 September. We will certainly make our contribution to the process of reflection that the international community will undertake together throughout this session to elaborate measures aimed at the eradication of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Before proceeding, I should like warmly to congratulate Mr. Han on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session, as well as the other members of the Bureau. His expertise in international affairs, together with his wisdom, will guarantee the success of our work, and the delegation of the Central African Republic would like to assure him of its cooperation. My delegation greatly appreciated the skilful way in which his predecessor conducted the work of the Millennium Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">We would also like to address, on behalf of the Central African Republic, our warmest congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election as Secretary-General. He has been honoured for his commitment to the cause of the Organization by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize, which is a tribute both to him and to the United Nations as a whole. He can continue to count upon the cooperation of the Central African Republic in the fulfilment of his extremely difficult mission, in the wake of last year's adoption by Member States of the Millennium Declaration, which establishes a new framework for cooperation between States.</div>
	<div class="p">Indeed, the Millennium Declaration must be viewed as a strategy within which States should work so as to be able meet the many challenges facing the world today, which include poverty, conflict, intolerance, terrorism, debt, marginalization, endemic disease and HIV/AIDS. These growing challenges, the persistence of which leads to global imbalance, can be dealt with only through multilateral cooperation, above all in the framework of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Such cooperation must first of all aim to eradicate the causes of certain frustrating problems in the world, by, for example, achieving a just and lasting settlement of the question of the Middle East.</div>
	<div class="p">Likewise, my delegation urges the parties concerned to implement the provisions of the Lusaka Agreement so that the Democratic Republic of the Congo can regain its territorial integrity and unity and establish a lasting peace, which will be of benefit to the Central African Republic.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, States should cooperate in support of Africa, which is currently burdened by the weight of numerous challenges. The Millennium Summit rightly committed the international community to a campaign for development cooperation so as to make the right to development, like human rights, a reality for all.</div>
	<div class="p">The Central African Republic, which endorsed the Millennium Declaration, urges the countries of the North to establish a true partnership with Africa, at both the public and private level, so as to support the developmental efforts of the continent. This will require a degree of political will, since, given the conflicts that are taking place today between, and often within, States, our partners sometimes give in to despair and indifference when confronted with slow progress, or occasionally allow themselves to be swayed by emotions incited by certain people who wish to discourage initiatives by abusively manipulating ideas that promote genocide and ethnic cleansing -- phenomena that some countries have recently endured, but that can gain no foothold today in a country such as the Central African Republic.</div>
	<div class="p">We often forget that the deep-seated sources of such conflicts are the lack of a culture of democracy in our societies and extreme poverty. That is why our partners should support our efforts to achieve democratization and contribute to consolidating the foundations of our young democracies, above all by paying priority attention to the economic aspect, which, unfortunately, is not always the case.</div>
	<div class="p">In the case of the Central African Republic, for example, on 28 May last an attempted coup took place with the aim of ending the march of democracy in the country. That was the fourth such attempt in the five years since 1996. We would like briefly to shed some light on those events.</div>
	<div class="p">At its 4261st meeting, on 23 January 2001, the Security Council considered the situation in the Central African Republic. While noting certain shortcomings, the Council recognized the efforts of the Government and asked it, along with representatives of all parts of society in the Central African Republic, to continue down the path towards the consolidation of democracy and the preservation of peace. To help in that task, the mandate of the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA) has been extended because, with the assistance of others, it is doing remarkable and productive work.</div>
	<div class="p">Despite everything, the Central African Republic is determined to continue resolutely to be a small haven of relative stability in a region torn apart by war, as one eminent personality put it recently. The social and political tension has, indeed, begun to diminish. Since May 2001, there has been an international presence.</div>
	<div class="p">Contrary to all expectations, the same groups that have repeatedly subjected the people of the Central African Republic to acts of terrorism for five years committed an act whose foreseeable and tragic consequences are well known. When condemned by both the national and international community, those groups rushed to hide behind claims of genocidal practices in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable, thus creating ethnic division in various parts of the country.</div>
	<div class="p">This recurrence of violent crises raises questions about justice in our young States, which are trying to establish the rule of law, but where amnesties are granted in lieu of justice, allowing impunity to prevail and thus encouraging recidivism.</div>
	<div class="p">Fortunately, the world has spoken out in condemnation of the most recent coup attempt, and we would like to take this opportunity, from this rostrum, to thank the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Community of Sahel Saharan States, as well as brotherly and friendly countries, which responded immediately, calling for the re-establishment of constitutional legality.</div>
	<div class="p">Any coup, be it failed or successful, always gives rise to actions to undermine freedom, human rights, the rights of society and national rights. The Central African Republic did not want to play that game. Thus, a number of appropriate measures have been taken, including the creation of a joint judicial inquiry commission; the establishment of contacts among the various social sectors and with the chancelleries, organizations and accredited institutions in the Central African Republic at the governmental and presidential levels; and diplomatic activity with the countries of the subregion and the region, which are being pursued.</div>
	<div class="p">However, beyond the attempted coup of 28 May, the entire situation in the Central African Republic must be assessed as a whole. Just recently, having refused to present himself to the commission of judicial inquiry that had been established specifically to determine the consequences of the attempted coup of 28 May, the former army Chief of Staff organized resistance that threatened to turn into a rebellion and almost plunged the country into renewed tragedy. The rapid reaction of the Organization of African Unity, the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States and neighbouring brotherly countries has certainly helped to calm the situation for the moment.</div>
	<div class="p">All these events, sorely trying to men of good will, have again highlighted the question of the march of democracy in the Central African Republic. That march has been made even more difficult by the nation's extreme poverty and fragility, which, because of enormous financial hardships, is unable to cover the costs of sovereignty, creating a veritable breeding ground of instability. The attempted coup on 28 May exacerbated the country's situation by plunging it into tragic destitution.</div>
	<div class="p">This situation has been clearly grasped by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which, on 2 August, reminded its member States, for their information and possible action, of the decision on the situation in the Central African Republic, adopted at the seventy-fourth ordinary session of the Council of Ministers in Lusaka, which</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Appeals to Member States and the rest of the international community to provide the necessary economic and financial assistance for the reconstruction of the Central African Republic and in particular calls on the countries which have promised to provide funds at the Pledging Conference in favour of the Central African Republic in New York in May 2000 to honour their commitments." (<i>CM/Dec.602 (LXXIV), para. 4</i>)</div>
	<div class="p">The Central African Republic thanks the OAU for that decision. We also wish here to express our gratitude to the Security Council, which has always shown great interest in the situation in our country. We further wish to make special mention here of Gabon, France and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, as well as the friends of the Central African Republic represented here, for their firm involvement at the side of the Central African Republic. We hope that they will not despair over these repeated crises because, in spite of everything, we in the Central African Republic are truly determined to overcome our problems.</div>
	<div class="p">We therefore hope that the United Nations will advocate even more energetically the cause of our country before the various international financial institutions with a view to securing greater assistance for us, because the repercussions of the series of events that began in 1996 will require significant financial resources to ensure the recovery of the country, the total collapse of which would have an impact throughout our subregion, if not beyond.</div>
	<div class="p">We are called upon at this session to consider the manner in which States should implement the Millennium Declaration through their conduct. It is only through cooperation and solidarity that we can achieve this and thus ensure for the world the fulfilment of the objectives set out in the United Nations Charter. This cooperation should also allow us to find the necessary means of meeting the common challenge of terrorism, which is more apparent today than ever before.</div>

	<div class="p">I join with other delegations in congratulating Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to chair the proceedings of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I also take this opportunity to express my deep satisfaction at the award of this year's Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. It is a well-deserved vote of confidence in the Secretary-General's leadership as well as recognition of the pivotal role being played by the United Nations in an era of immense challenge for the international community during these early years of the twenty-first century. We are greatly reassured that his firm guidance will continue for a further term to shape the direction of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p">At this time of renewed sadness for the people of New York and of the Dominican Republic, may I also offer my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in Monday's tragic crash of American Airlines flight 587.</div>
	<div class="p">For all of us, this year's journey to New York to address the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session stands in stark contrast to the comfortable annual routine we have grown to appreciate. We come instead to a city behind barricades, a people traumatized and bewildered, a mood of foreboding and uncertainty on the streets and in these corridors. The horror of terrorism -- one that has scarred innocent lives for decades in the Middle East, in Northern Ireland and other parts of Europe, in Asia, in Africa and in Latin America -- has now landed on these shores with a fury and intensity that few of us would have thought possible.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The Government of Barbados has been explicit and unequivocal in its condemnation of the terrorist attacks of 11 September and has pledged to cooperate fully with the international community in the sustained effort to respond to this global threat. No cause or grievance can ever justify the use of violence as a means of settling disputes or legitimize the taking of innocent lives. The use of terrorism is incompatible with the ideals of the United Nations and cannot be allowed to prevail.</div>
	<div class="p">Barbados shares America's grief, for we have lost five proud and hard-working citizens to this senseless carnage. We share America's bewilderment and disbelief, for our citizens, too, have experienced that sense of violation and loss of innocence that comes with an unprecedented terrorist strike. Twenty-five years ago, on 6 October 1976, the unthinkable happened to Barbados with the terrorist downing of a Cubana Airlines flight just outside our territorial waters. Although the masterminds of that attack were identified and apprehended, they were never punished for their crime, but were instead encouraged to remain actively engaged in their campaign of terror. We share America's sense of outrage and determination to bring the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks to justice. We must also insist that there be zero tolerance for terrorism, whatever its source or ideology.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is a global problem which requires a global solution. For many years, the United Nations has recognized the threat which terrorism poses to the promotion and maintenance of world peace. Since 1963, when this Organization adopted its first anti-terrorism convention, some 12 related conventions have been approved by the international community. Barbados is a party to seven of these instruments. Earlier this week, I had the honour of signing the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Financing. Our Government is actively reviewing the remaining conventions and their administrative and legislative implications with a view to providing for early adherence.</div>
	<div class="p">Barbados is committed to taking all necessary measures to minimize the risk of terrorist acts being perpetrated or financed in or from its national territory. A thorough review of security has been undertaken at our airport and seaport, and our authorities have taken immediate action to ensure compliance with the enhanced International Civil Aviation Organization and Federal Aviation Administration guidelines issued after 11 September. We have also taken legislative action to further strengthen our already well-regulated financial services regime through amendments to the Money Laundering (Prevention and Control) Act and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. Within the Caribbean Community we have agreed to increase cooperation in intelligence-gathering, analysis and dissemination among our security and enforcement personnel. We expect shortly to be in a position to report in detail to the Security Council on measures taken in compliance with the terms of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Just as we agree that terrorism is a global phenomenon to which no country can consider itself immune, so too must we understand that it is a complex problem necessitating a multidimensional response. As the Secretary-General has so aptly put it in the 44th meeting, in his opening statement of the general debate:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"We face two possible futures: a mutually destructive clash between so-called civilizations based on the exaggeration of religious and cultural differences, or a global community, respecting diversity and rooted in universal values. The latter must be our choice, but we can achieve it only if we bring real hope to the billions now trapped in poverty, conflict and disease."</div>
	<div class="p">We must all accept that the struggle against terrorism can never hope to succeed if it is viewed simply as a military campaign to strike at the power base of the latest practitioners of terror. It must also seek to find effective and lasting solutions to the problems of underdevelopment, poverty and deprivation, inequality, intolerance and injustice that marginalize so large a percentage of the world's population. For it is from these conditions of hopelessness and despair that spring new converts to the cause of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The events of 11 September and the extent to which they have had an impact on the economic fortunes of all of our countries have shown us the other face of globalization: the reality of our growing economic interdependence. Now more than ever, there is a need to recognize the value of multilateralism and the pre-eminent role of the United Nations in the search for lasting solutions to the challenges that will confront us in the early years of the twenty-first century. The importance of giving priority to a revitalized development agenda cannot be overstated.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, Barbados looks to the International Conference on Financing for Development as a constructive forum for refocusing the dialogue on effective mechanisms for the implementation of the stalled development agenda. We agree there is need to reform the international economic and financial architecture to meet the current development challenges. We are pleased that international tax cooperation will be one of the issues discussed at the Conference.</div>
	<div class="p">Many developing countries, including Barbados, were encouraged to diversify into the financial services sector as a viable development alternative and now derive a significant proportion of their national revenue from that source. We therefore continue to insist on the need for universal participation in decisions that affect the operation of this sector.</div>
	<div class="p">Barbados is far advanced in the implementation of its national commitments under Agenda 21. We believe that the World Summit on Sustainable Development presents an important opportunity to build a new and expanded relationship with our development partners for the full implementation of commitments already undertaken at Rio. Johannesburg should not merely review the status of progress of Rio, but should also outline strategies for dealing decisively with the sustainable development challenges that have emerged since 1992. For all small island developing States, follow-up of the Barbados Programme of Action will form an integral part of this process.</div>
	<div class="p">Naturally, the Caribbean Basin countries will continue their efforts to create a special regime for the Caribbean Sea with the ultimate goal of achieving its recognition as a special area in the context of sustainable development.</div>
	<div class="p">It is no secret that the efforts towards the creation of a new international trading system have resulted in bitter disappointment for the majority of developing countries, which have been severely disadvantaged by the imbalance of rights, obligations, benefits and concessions agreed at Uruguay, and by the failure of Seattle to address that imbalance. We hope that the Doha decision to launch a new round will lead to a meaningful resolution of these critical developing country concerns. We are convinced that sustained economic and social progress for the developing world will be achievable only within the framework of a fair, equitable and inclusive trading arrangement that gives due recognition to the differences in size and level of development of Member States.</div>
	<div class="p">We welcome the agreement on drug patents, which represents a major victory for the efforts of developing countries to respond to their priority public health needs and is of great significance in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</div>
	<div class="p">The impact of the 11 September events on the Caribbean has been immediate and severe. The economic repercussions have served to emphasize the extreme fragility and vulnerability of our small States in the international economy. The countries of the Caribbean Community, whose economies are heavily dependent on tourism and financial services, have joined forces to coordinate a regional emergency response and recovery strategy to mitigate the effects of the crisis.</div>
	<div class="p">It is clear, however, that responses at the national and regional levels alone will be inadequate to deal with the magnitude of this unprecedented situation. In the words of the Prime Minister of Barbados, the Right Honourable Owen Arthur:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"the international financial community has traditionally required developing countries to rely heavily on policy responses to deal with economic crisis. But the situation that we face has not been caused by policy failure, recklessness or financial excesses by developing countries.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Policy responses without the commitment of real financial resources will therefore not suffice. Barbados therefore stands ready to support a well-conceived response from the international financial community to the crisis at hand."</div>
	<div class="p">It is the mission of the United Nations to promote the peaceful coexistence and the political, social and economic welfare of the world's peoples. It is in this context that we must recognize the significance of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance and renew our confidence in the capacity of multilateral organizations to resolve differences and promote a sense of shared values. This Conference presented a unique opportunity for countries to take a proactive approach in defusing both historic and contemporary conflicts and in coming to terms with the injustices of the past and creating new understandings for the future.</div>
	<div class="p">We regret that in many respects the Conference did not get the serious high-level attention it deserved and that the treatment of its fundamental issues was less wide-ranging and definitive than we would have wished. In the words of Professor Hilary Beckles, of the Barbados delegation:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The crisis of modernity that finds expression in spiralling racial hatred, xenophobia and related intolerance is not the sole burden of any one part of the global community, even though the victims of the crimes of which I speak continue to feel in the course of everyday life the kind of pain and anguish not easily imagined by others."</div>
	<div class="p">The citizens of the Caribbean are a transplanted people, who have forged from the crucible of slavery, colonialism and economic exploitation a vibrant, pluralistic, multiracial society built on tolerance and respect for ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. In these difficult times, we believe that there is much that can be learned from our experiences and much that can be done to promote the culture of peace and understanding, especially among the youth. In this regard, Barbados attaches importance to the early convening of the General Assembly special session on children and to a rededication of efforts to achieve the international development targets already set.</div>
	<div class="p">We would do well to remember that, in the words of the Secretary-General, "none of the issues that faced us on 10 September has become less urgent". Indeed, it would be an unfortunate irony if the global response to terrorism were conducted in such a manner -- through the massive redeployment of resources from other priorities, such as the fight against narcotics trafficking, extreme poverty, disease and environmental degradation -- as to further exacerbate the economic, political and cultural instabilities which are the primary breeding ground for terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Small countries like my own are not part of the problem, but we are nevertheless required to be part of the solution, in circumstances that place a disproportionate burden on our financial, human and administrative resources, which had already been struggling to respond to the global economic recession.</div>
	<div class="p">Barbados remains fully committed to the United Nations system and to the values it seeks to promote. We are keenly aware of the important work the United Nations continues to carry out in the eastern Caribbean. We are pleased to provide tangible support for that work through the provision of purpose-built headquarters to house the seven agencies whose subregional offices are located in Bridgetown. We will continue to work closely with the agencies in developing a model partnership for eastern Caribbean development.</div>
	<div class="p">In this context, we welcome the support of the United Nations Development Programme, in partnership with the International Monetary Fund and the Government of Canada, for the Caribbean Technical Assistance Centre, which was inaugurated last week in Barbados. We look forward to similar levels of United Nations cooperation for other important programmes, in particular that of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), whose work is providing critical support to the region in an extremely volatile international economic and security environment.</div>
	<div class="p">Two years ago, the Prime Minister of Barbados emphasized that we were leaving the twentieth century and entering the twenty-first conscious of the dangers, but excited by the prospects. Recent events must not be allowed to dampen our optimism. We must remain firm in the hope that humanity possesses the fortitude and determination to triumph in the face of extreme adversity, and that respect for diversity, human dignity and the sanctity of human life will prevail.</div>
	<div class="p">We are not expected to complete this task, but neither are we at liberty to abstain from it.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">At the outset, my delegation extends profound sympathy to the families of the victims who lost their lives on the flight to the Dominican Republic.</div>
	<div class="p">The rescheduled general debate now convened, well into the work of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, only serves to reconfirm our awareness of Mr. Han's great diplomatic and communicative skills. For this, my delegation thanks and congratulates him once again. Under his competent leadership we hope this will be a fruitful and decisive session of the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">This being my first opportunity, may I take the stand, on behalf of the Government and people of Grenada, to heartily congratulate the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, and the United Nations on the designation as recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.</div>
	<div class="p">Just as the fifty-fifth session was the Millennium Assembly of joy, hope and optimism, this fifty-sixth session, by contrast, can be called the unpredictable Assembly of challenge and adversity, from which the international community can nevertheless derive strength and unity in the pursuit of a common enemy who will eventually be found and brought to justice.</div>
	<div class="p">The challenge and uncertainty have come about because terrorism now threatens the entire civilized world. The catastrophic and traumatic events of 11 September have changed not only the lives of individuals, for whom we grieve so painfully, but it has also changed the modus vivendi and the modus operandi of our present-day civilization in many respects. If this cloud of hatred and revenge is allowed to prevail, history will long remember that evil triumphed due to inaction.</div>
	<div class="p">Thus, the broad international coalition brought together by the United States of America and supported by Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1.pdf">resolution 56/1</a> stands as a bulwark ready to break the immoral and physical backbone of terrorism. Grenada fully supports and endorses <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which sets out important measures that countries -- large and small, rich and poor -- must all take together to prevent and combat terrorists in our jurisdictions or wherever they may be found.</div>
	<div class="p">The newly formed Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee, under the chairmanship of the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, is a welcome and laudable effort in the struggle that deserves the backing and support of all Member States morally, strategically and financially. In addition, it is soliciting assistance from persons with particular skills in the performance of special functions.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Grenada has already begun to take steps within its jurisdiction to implement measures within our capacity that prevent and suppress the financing of terrorists acts. Our priority to prevent those who finance, plan, facilitate or commit terrorist acts from using Grenada for those purposes against other States or their citizens, as well as to find ways to intensify and accelerate the exchange and sharing of information. Grenada is examining its administrative and other processes with a view to improving efficiency in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p">We are active in the global fight against terrorism. Grenada is cooperating with the United States authorities to ensure that there are no terrorist funds in any of our offshore institutions. Further, Grenada has thoroughly examined its economic citizenship programme to ensure that no known terrorists had inadvertently been granted citizenship. We are now confident that no such person is an economic citizen of Grenada. In light of the changed global environment and our commitment to assist in the fight against terrorism in any way we can, the Government of Grenada has taken the decision to suspend indefinitely the economic citizenship programme.</div>
	<div class="p">Moreover, Grenada continues to intensify its participation in regional and international cooperation efforts as we seek to ensure that there are no gaps in the global framework for the fight against this heinous crime. Grenada will reinforce and extend its international cooperation arrangements in the field of justice, policing and law enforcement.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Grenada fully supports the development of a comprehensive and effective legal framework to combat terrorism. My country has begun a review of international conventions already in place, with a view to signing, ratifying and fully implementing them. Those not yet in effect will be implemented. Some of these conventions are within the United Nations system, while others are of a regional or hemispheric nature. Priority is being given to the existing 12 United Nations international conventions against terrorism -- in particular, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">It is necessary for the international community to send a clear and unambiguous signal to terrorists that their philosophy is fundamentally wrong and totally unacceptable. We must stand united in our efforts to combat and eliminate activities aimed at killing innocent people and destroying communities. The Government of Grenada joins the Caribbean Community in pledging our full support of efforts to confront terrorism and restore the rights and freedom of people the world over. My delegation would like to focus for a few moments on the impact that this dastardly act has had nationally, regionally and internationally.</div>
	<div class="p">In my country, as elsewhere in the Caribbean, the effect of the global economic turbulence has hit the tourism and aviation sectors hardest. Tourism, the hotel industry and aviation play a synergistic role that is crucial to the economies of most small States in terms of foreign exchange and employment.</div>
	<div class="p">The subregion had already begun to feel the effects of the international economic downturn, which caused the deterioration of our fortunes. But it is clear that since the terrorist attacks on the United States of America, Grenada and the other members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) are suffering from further reduction in economic activities. We are now severely challenged.</div>
	<div class="p">We are experiencing shortfalls in revenue collection. Our tourism sector is experiencing a drastic reduction in visitor arrivals. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund predicts that arrivals in the Caribbean region could fall short by as much as 50 per cent. Our air and marine transport are also experiencing severe reductions. Regional air carriers have registered as much as a 45 per cent fall in passenger load since 11 September.</div>
	<div class="p">The picture looks bleak, but we are determined that our response must prevent the devastation envisioned by the perpetrators of terror. Soon after 11 September, the Prime Minister of Grenada and Chairman of the OECS, The Honourable Dr. Keith Mitchell, convened a meeting of OECS to discuss the impact on tourism and related activities -- hotels, banks, agriculture, manufacturing and transportation. The subregional meeting of OECS took a number of decisions that will respond to our economic challenges. One such measure is the formation of the Grenada National Economic Council. This will give effect to the revival of sustainable tourism. It will address fiscal and economic performance, and it will give impetus to productivity. In addition, only recently in the Bahamas, the Caribbean Community heads of Government met and approved an $18 million joint public/private sector emergency tourism promotion programme, demonstrating self-help at its best in the region.</div>
	<div class="p">The events of 11 September, with the ensuing economic and geopolitical instability, have propelled us to reorder our priorities. We need to focus on restoring confidence in international economic and multilateral cooperation. As we all know, the member States of the World Trade Organization do not participate on a level playing field. The developing world is still struggling to bridge the economic and social divide in our global community. Some were not in favour of the second round of negotiations. Yet some States were willing to put their differences aside and endeavour to march towards the next stage of economic and multilateral cooperation. This is clearly what we aspire to in this august body.</div>
	<div class="p">While concerns about terrorism have dominated the general debate, and rightly so, mention must be made of the unfinished agenda of the last decade of the twentieth century with respect to social and economic development, central to which is the human person.</div>
	<div class="p">The following United Nations summit-level conferences, which have been held in the past 10 years, have all stressed sustainable development and the centrality of the human person in the process: the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992; the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993; the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994; the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen in 1995; the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) in Istanbul in 1996; the World Food Summit in Rome in 1996; the Millennium Summit in 2000; and the special session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS in 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">The question is: How much of the outcome of these conferences has been implemented with respect to poverty alleviation, the empowerment of women, health, education, children and the elderly, trade liberalization, economic cooperation, and the sharing and transfer of technology? Could it be that these conferences and special sessions promised more than they could deliver? Promising too much is as bad as doing too little.</div>
	<div class="p">The fight against poverty underpins all of those things. To feed the hungry is both a divine and a social imperative. Thus, the international community is particularly concerned that the International Conference on Financing for Development to be held next year in Mexico and the World Summit for Sustainable Development to be held in South Africa, both so important for small States, should yield positive results. The Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States is still a major and unfulfilled component of the process of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, and it should be high on the implementation agenda this time around.</div>
	<div class="p">For more than 40 years an embargo has existed against a small country in the Caribbean. What this has done is to ostracize the Cuban people and cause them undue hardship. What it has achieved is to make the Cuban people more innovative. The old wounds have healed, the pain has dulled and the cause has diminished. I wish to register Grenada's support for the removal of the United States of America's economic embargo on Cuba. Members will recall that last year 167 Member States voted in favour of the removal of that embargo. Only three voted against and four abstained. That shows the overwhelming position of the international community against those sanctions. Trade, as we know, is important for the development of any people, and with the embargo there is no freedom of trade between Cuba and the United States.</div>
	<div class="p">In the wake of the devastation caused in Cuba by hurricane Michelle, it is now critical that steps be taken to remove the embargo and to give the Cuban people a chance to recover from that unstoppable force of nature. The easing of the economic embargo against Cuba could assist in the overall development of that country, a small nation seeking against all odds to maintain a modern, dynamic society in the Caribbean and in Latin America. The lifting of the embargo would augur well for friendly cooperative relations among all the countries of this hemisphere.</div>
	<div class="p">Now, I turn to the issue of the Republic of China on Taiwan. Grenada believes that a country that exhibits fortitude and that has moved its economy from poor and underdeveloped to affluent and prosperous deserves recognition. A country that consistently shows international responsibility surely deserves to be admitted to this community of nations. The time has come to reconsider the exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwan from membership of the United Nations. The Republic of China is home to 23 million people. It is a free and democratic country, and a peace-loving member of the international community. In economic terms, the Republic of China on Taiwan is the seventeenth largest economy in the world, the eighth largest investor in and fourth largest exporter of information technology products, and the third largest holder of foreign reserves. It is preposterous to continue to keep such a country outside the world body.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Grenada appeals for that wrong to be corrected. We are therefore requesting that the United Nations recognize the natural right of the people of Taiwan to become active participants in this Organization. We believe that the Government and the people of Taiwan are seeking to participate in the United Nations and to contribute constructively to the international community. Grenada urges that they be given that opportunity and that right.</div>
	<div class="p">Grenada, however, notes with satisfaction the admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan into the World Trade Organisation. It is the hope of my delegation that the past, present and future performance of Taiwan as a major democratic and international economic player, although Taiwan is not now a member of the United Nations, will in the not-too-distant future enable it to regain its rightful place in the family of nations.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations membership must make Article 3 of the Charter a major priority in the next few years. Our founding fathers called for the Organization</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"To achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion."</div>
	<div class="p">We must do all in our power to provide added economic opportunities for the developing world. We believe that trade is one avenue to achieve this. I therefore call on the Economic and Social Council actively to pursue undertakings that could create an encouraging atmosphere in which Member States could have the opportunity to raise the standard of living of their peoples. In the current global environment, we must be conscious that inclusion in the processes of the global economy is vital.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, I must recall Article 1 of the United Nations Charter, which calls for the Organization</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace."</div>
	<div class="p">We must be relentless in our pursuit of the purposes of the Organization. Our challenge is to work towards the elimination of terrorist activities. Our quest must be for economic opportunities for all States. And our goal should be the peaceful coexistence of all peoples of the international community.</div>

	<div class="p">I now invite His Excellency Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique, to take the floor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="18-9">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Simão" nation="Mozambique" language="">
	Mr. Simão (Mozambique)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo upon his election to preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, and to express my confidence that with his skilful guidance, his leadership and his outstanding experience our deliberations will be crowned with success. Allow me also to pay a special tribute to His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri for the excellent manner in which he conducted the affairs of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. I wish him success in his future endeavours.</div>
	<div class="p">On behalf of the people and the Government of Mozambique, I would like to extend our congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan on his well-deserved election to the post of Secretary-General for a second term, as well as on having won the Nobel Peace Prize this year. We hail his re-election and the Noble Peace Prize awarded to him and to the United Nations as recognition of his and the Organization's tireless efforts in the search for viable and lasting solutions to the problems facing humanity.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me to express our sympathy to the Government and the people of Algeria with regard to the loss of life and property caused by the recent floods in that sisterly country. Mozambique, having been the victim of terrible floods over two consecutive years, shares the sorrow of the Algerian people.</div>
	<div class="p">We also express our condolences to the Government and the people of the United States of America and of the Dominican Republic on the tragedy which resulted from the plane crash last Monday here in New York.</div>
	<div class="p">On 11 September, we witnessed the most barbaric terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. We are deeply shocked at the loss of thousands of innocent lives.</div>
	<div class="p">We wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity to reiterate once again the condolences of the Government and the people of the Republic of Mozambique to the Government and the people of the United States of America on the tragic and unjustifiable deaths of their citizens. We express our sympathy and solidarity with all of the victims and the families that have lost their loved ones.</div>
	<div class="p">We reiterate our condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, regardless of its origin or place of occurrence, or of the race or religion of those who perpetrate it. Terrorism represents a serious threat to international peace and security as well as to friendly relations among peoples and nations worldwide.</div>
	<div class="p">The struggle against this scourge requires concerted action by the whole international community, within the framework of the United Nations, for the target of this evil is not a single nation or people but humankind as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p">It is therefore crucial that all United Nations Member States work together towards signing and ratifying all of the conventions and protocols related to the eradication of this enemy of humanity. These conventions represent the legal foundation upon which we can build our collective action against international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The work that is under way for the elaboration of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism constitutes a further effort to reinforce the international community's resolve to face the challenge of eliminating the scourge of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Mozambique came about as the result of the exercise by Mozambicans of their inalienable right to self-determination. Therefore, Mozambicans know well from their own experience what terrorism is all about. But they are also aware of the distinction between terrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples for their freedom and independence.</div>
	<div class="p">Mozambique is ready to participate in a global discussion on this issue, as an important and useful initiative to formulate a joint organized response to international terrorism, so that the targets of our common struggle against terrorism are clearly defined.</div>
	<div class="p">Conscious of the need for the effective implementation of national measures to combat terrorism as a way to complement the international legal regime, Mozambique has already initiated a comprehensive review of international legal instruments to combat and eliminate terrorism, with a view to ratifying and adhering to them.</div>
	<div class="p">In this context, Mozambique signed, on 11 November, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. However, it is clear to us that, for an effective implementation of this and other legal instruments, Mozambique needs support from the international community to strengthen its institutions -- namely the police, the judiciary, the financial system and the State prosecutor's office.</div>
	<div class="p">Last year, our heads of State and Government met here during the Millennium Summit to reaffirm their faith in the United Nations and in its Charter as indispensable foundations for a just, peaceful and more prosperous world.</div>
	<div class="p">The leaders set specific targets to halve the proportion of people who live in extreme poverty, to provide clean water and basic education for all, to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and to achieve other development goals. They called for the strengthening of United Nations peace operations so that vulnerable communities can count on them in their hour of need. They committed themselves to fighting injustice and inequality, terror and crime, and to meeting the special needs of Africa. In order to achieve these lofty goals, all Member States should display political will and the determination to turn these commitments into concrete actions at the international, regional and national levels.</div>
	<div class="p">The holding by the United Nations of the special sessions of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS and on Habitat, the Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance represent bold steps towards resolving the various problems affecting humanity and constitute concrete steps in the implementation of the provisions of the Millennium Declaration.</div>
	<div class="p">Mozambique is proud of having played an active role in contributing to the promising outcome of the United Nations Conference on small arms and light weapons. We are confident that the commitments assumed at that Conference will contribute decisively towards preventing, combating and eradicating the illicit trade in, and proliferation of, small arms and light weapons.</div>
	<div class="p">We should continuously and critically assess the progress made in each area of commitment, with a view to translating into reality the aspirations and needs of our peoples. Each subsequent session of the General Assembly should be used to assess the degree of progress made in the implementation of the declared commitment towards specific targets. To this end, we should ensure that follow-up mechanisms are put in place and effectively enhanced for the successful implementation of the plans of action adopted.</div>
	<div class="p">As we take on the daunting task of pursuing the goals of the Millennium Summit, we need to work together in a spirit of partnership and cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p">Today we are living in a world in which a few countries are reaping the benefits of globalization, while the majority, particularly in Africa, are increasingly being marginalized by the global economy. Consequently, these increasing inequalities and asymmetries aggravate poverty, fuel conflicts and threaten international security, stability, democracy and peace.</div>
	<div class="p">To reverse this negative trend, we call upon all developed countries to fulfil their commitment with regard to official development assistance, increase the levels of foreign direct investment in poor countries, and to cancel the external debt of the heavily indebted poor countries.</div>
	<div class="p">It is disturbing to note that in Africa 340 million people -- half of the population of the continent -- live on less than $1 per day. The mortality rate for children under five years of age is about 140 per 1,000, and life expectancy at birth is only 54 years. Only 58 per cent of the population has access to safe water; the rate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 41 per cent; and there are only 18 main telephone lines per 1,000 people in Africa, compared with 145 for the world as a whole and 567 for high-income economies.</div>
	<div class="p">This appalling situation requires a strong and clear commitment on the part of us all -- Africans first and foremost -- the international community and other relevant stakeholders.</div>
	<div class="p">The establishment of the African Union during the thirty-seventh Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of the African Unity is recognition that only by pooling our efforts can we find effective solutions to problems affecting the continent. This effort deserves the support of the international community, so that a solid union and strong integration can become a reality in Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">The New Partnership for African Development is an initiative aimed at setting an agenda for the renewal of the continent, based on national and regional priorities and on development plans prepared through a participatory process. It foresees a new framework of interaction with the rest of the world, including the industrialized countries and multilateral organizations. The encouragement given by the G-8 Summit and other multilateral institutions in Genoa, Italy, last July is much appreciated.</div>
	<div class="p">We are also encouraged by the commitment assumed by ministers and heads of delegations at the high-level segment of the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council held in Geneva last July, in welcoming the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and calling on the United Nations system and the international community to support it. The invitation extended by the Council to the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure an effective and coordinated response of the United Nations system is a good course of action aimed at promoting sustainable development and active participation of Africa in the world economy. The African leadership and ownership of the NEPAD must be guaranteed during its implementation.</div>
	<div class="p">Conflicts are one of the main obstacles to development, particularly in Africa. In order to find durable solutions to conflicts, we need to focus our actions on prevention measures and address the root causes of conflict. In this regard, prevention should be aimed at addressing, inter alia, poverty, governance, human rights abuses, hunger, endemic diseases and underdevelopment. The success of this action requires national ownership based on partnership between the Government and civil society.</div>
	<div class="p">Beyond the preventive measures, we should also think how we can effectively implement sound strategies for conflict resolution and management. The comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects contained in the Brahimi report provides sound recommendations to improve the effectiveness of peacekeeping. It emphasizes the need for effective command and control structures, enhanced levels of interoperability, as well as the importance of training troops to understand and operate with more robust rules of engagement. We believe that the recommendations contained in the report will be effective if more resources are allocated to peacekeeping activities, particularly in Africa, and if the response to actual conflicts are timely, so as to avoid the application of double standards.</div>
	<div class="p">Initiatives undertaken by regions and subregions aimed at conflict prevention, management and resolution should be supported and endowed with the resources they need to build their capacity to act effectively. The Organization of African Unity Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution should be enhanced and consolidated to better give appropriate and timely responses to conflicts affecting Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community should continue to assist Africa in searching for the peaceful resolution of conflicts, particularly in Sierra Leone and Somalia, as well as in Western Sahara, when a United Nations plan has been agreed to by all parties to the conflict.</div>
	<div class="p">It is worth noting that within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) we are strongly engaged in activities aimed at tackling conflicts affecting the region. As the current chair of the SADC Organ for Politics, Defence and Security, Mozambique, in close cooperation with the other member States, will spare no efforts to promote peace and security, through conflict prevention and resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">SADC will continue to work with the United Nations and all cooperating partners to bring about lasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola and in other conflicts on the continent. The partnership between SADC and the United Nations should be continuously maintained and nurtured in the spirit of the Brahimi report.</div>
	<div class="p">As the chair of the Community of the Portuguese-Speaking Countries, Mozambique is also engaged in the current efforts to bring about lasting solutions to the problems still affecting some of Community's member States. The Community is happy to welcome East Timor, which will proclaim its independence in May 2002 as a result of our joint, concerted efforts with the East Timorese people.</div>
	<div class="p">We are committed to the efforts made by SADC members to eradicate poverty, combat HIV/AIDS and better respond to challenges posed by globalization, as a way to prevent conflicts. We are also supportive of the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan within SADC, which aims at boosting the region's development agenda for the coming decade.</div>
	<div class="p">Political dialogue, consensus building, partnership and cooperation are a must and should be pursued vigorously. We believe that the World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting in Doha, the forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development and the World Summit on Sustainable Development provide unique opportunities to collectively produce an integrated and effective mechanism for the eradication of poverty and the overall implementation of the development goals set out in the Millennium Declaration and in the plan of action for the Least Developed Countries.</div>
	<div class="p">It is our expectation that the Monterrey Conference will be instrumental in reshaping the world economic order, giving it more equity and fairness. To that end, the Conference must resolutely address the steady decline of official development assistance and foreign direct investment, untie development aid (as already done by the United Kingdom, which we salute), reform the international financial architecture and provide a sustainable solution to the debt crisis through broad, deep and faster debt relief mechanisms, including total debt cancellation for least developed countries.</div>
	<div class="p">The World Summit on Sustainable Development should allow us to assess the implementation of Agenda 21, as well as devising appropriate strategies to further pursue this daunting challenge. In Johannesburg, we should strive to ensure the right balance between environmental protection and socio-economic development, while making poverty eradication our highest priority and fully reinstating the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. This is perfectly consistent with the Rio spirit embodied in Agenda 21, a blueprint that should be absolutely endorsed; we should avoid any renegotiation of Agenda 21.</div>
	<div class="p">In Mozambique the incidence of poverty reaches about 70 per cent of the population. To address this negative picture, the Government approved an action plan for the reduction of absolute poverty, commonly known as PARPA, for the period 2001-2005. The strategic vision of PARPA is founded on two imperatives: the need to maintain peace and stability and the need for rapid, sustained and broad-based growth, where private initiatives play an important role. The programme has gained strong support from the meeting of the Consultative Group that was held recently in Maputo and a boost from Mozambican debt reduction, made within the framework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Mozambique is greatly thankful to all its cooperating partners for the support pledged at the Consultative Group meeting and for the enhanced HIPC. We hope for a quick implementation of the commitments made, so that our resolve to combat poverty can be a success.</div>
	<div class="p">Looking at the longer term, the Government of Mozambique launched a national initiative, Agenda 2025, a strategy based on a constructive dialogue on the future of Mozambique. The Agenda aims at creating, through a participatory and inclusive process, a national strategic vision for development, as well as strengthening the Government's and civil society's ability to define and implement national policies and projects.</div>
	<div class="p">The fight against HIV/AIDS is another priority for the Government of Mozambique, for which it has adopted a national strategic plan that focuses on prevention and reduction of the impact of the disease. The plan places the human being at the centre of action and is directed at the vulnerable groups of the society, including women, orphaned children and youth, particularly girls. In this endeavour, the Government has adopted a multisector approach, with the active involvement of all stakeholders, including our civil society.</div>
	<div class="p">Because HIV/AIDS is a global problem, combating it calls for a global solution, and we commend the United Nations for having proposed the creation of a Global AIDS and Health Fund to combat HIV/AIDS. The Fund will contribute positively to the prevention and combat of this epidemic, which gravely affects the region of sub-Saharan Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">Floods affected Mozambique in the years 2000 and 2001 consecutively, which resulted in loss of life and production and damage to infrastructure, including roads, schools, hospitals and houses, and forced people to flee from their lands and abandon their belongings. These catastrophes posed a serious setback to the development of our country.</div>
	<div class="p">We are encouraged by the outcome of the Post-Flood Reconstruction Conference, held in Maputo in July 2001, at which the Government of Mozambique presented the reconstruction programme for the central region of the country, following the devastation caused by the floods in the early part of 2001. At that Conference, the Government also had the opportunity to report on progress made on the implementation of the programme that had been presented at the International Reconstruction Conference on Mozambique in Rome in May 2000. Once again, we wish to thank all those who extended assistance to our country. The Government of Mozambique also appreciates the contribution of the United Nations system and the international community at large in our efforts to consolidate peace, to strengthen democratic institutions and to promote development.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my country's faith in the United Nations and its Charter, for they both remain indispensable foundations for a just, peaceful and more prosperous world.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Seyoum Mesfin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="22-8">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Mesfin" nation="Ethiopia" language="">
	Mr. Mesfin (Ethiopia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">At the outset, allow me to express my sincere congratulations to the President on his election to lead the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am fully confident that under his presidency, we will have productive discussions and reach a fruitful conclusion. I would also like to convey my appreciation to the outgoing President for his conduct of the work of the last session.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me also take this opportunity to once again convey my Government's warmest congratulations to our Secretary-General on his appointment to lead our Organization for a second term. Indeed, his re-election is well deserved. We are also delighted that the United Nations and the Secretary-General were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this year. It is a testimony to and a recognition of the important work the United Nations has been doing.</div>
	<div class="p">It is now over two months since the terrible events of 11 September. What happened on that day touched not only the people of the United States but also the whole world. Not only because scores of countries lost nationals, but also because New York, the seat of the United Nations, is in many ways the capital of the world. The terrorists might have succeeded in committing this unimaginable and barbaric crime, but we have no doubt that they have failed to extinguish the hope and vitality that New York symbolizes and embodies.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is not new to Ethiopia. For the past 10 years, we have been victims of terrorist attacks, and we have combated it. That is why we remain committed to doing our utmost to enhance the international effort to root out terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Over the long term, terrorism will be defeated when the ideological cover it is wearing is removed and shown to be empty. But this can be achieved only when those who are capable of perpetrating heinous crimes are not only denied safe havens, but also deprived of any alibi. This is where, among other things, the fight against poverty becomes all the more critical.</div>
	<div class="p">The fight against poverty is not as elusive as the fight against terrorism. For the former, we know the causes, and we know how to fight it and which tools to use. What we lack is the global political will to act. The grimness of conditions in Africa in this regard is obvious. There is no need for me to go into detail regarding the statistics on the situation in Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">African leaders have taken the conclusions of the Millennium Assembly a step further and have come up with the New African Initiative, now called the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). They have drawn a broad plan on how to bring peace, security and development to a continent that has been plagued by conflict, overwhelmed with insecurity and mired in underdevelopment. The main thrust of the initiative is that we in Africa have duly acknowledged the responsibility for our continent's fate. Hence, we fully accept that peace, security, democracy, good governance and sound economic management are essential conditions for economic growth and sustainable development. At the same time, we are fully aware that Africa at present lacks the required resources and capacity to implement this initiative. This new African initiative thus calls for a complementary obligation on the part of the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to point out the importance of this mutual obligation. Without it, we cannot look forward to the future with confidence; without it, the consequences are bound to be grave. This is the challenge that we face in Africa. The international community must confront it with renewed vigour and dedication.</div>
	<div class="p">On the subject of our national effort to seize the opportunity presented by the prevailing peace in my country, I have the pleasure to inform the Assembly that we are now back on track in terms of playing our proper role for peace and investing all our energy and resources in fighting poverty at the national level. This is a war, and we count on our partners to stand with us in waging it. Our strategy in fighting poverty touches on everything we do -- in politics, diplomacy and the economic domain.</div>
	<div class="p">We want to succeed in the fight against the HIV/ AIDS pandemic affecting our country. This major scourge must be defeated. We are determined to fight against corruption, and our record is unambiguous in this area. We are committed to pursuing this without any let-up.</div>
	<div class="p">I would now like to turn to the political and security situation in our subregion, which, for obvious reasons, is critical for us, as it should be a source of concern for the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">The problem in Somalia needs to be resolved as speedily as possible. There is no reason why the situation should be allowed to continue festering, to the detriment of the people of Somalia and of the subregion in general. The parties to the conflict have to sit down without preconditions to establish a broad-based Government. That is what was called for by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development at the meeting at the summit level in November 2000. This has to be implemented. This is the most viable alternative. To do less would amount to abandoning Somalia for international terrorists to wreak havoc there and in the subregion. The establishment of a broad-based Government in Somalia that includes all the major political forces in the country is a crucial step towards peace-making in Somalia, for which there is no substitute. Ethiopia intends, along with other members of the IGAD subcommittee on Somalia, to play a more proactive role for the realization of this objective.</div>
	<div class="p">We are also prepared to do our level best to assist in the process of national reconciliation in Sudan. We plan to be more active in this undertaking as well. We believe that to bring the peace process forward, the will and determination of the parties is critical. But they need to be assisted, and assist we will, in good faith and with all the necessary responsibility.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to the situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the implementation of the Algiers Peace Agreement, it is neither prudent nor proper for me to conceal from the international community both our disappointment and, more importantly, our growing concern. But let me, right from the outset, lest I be misunderstood, make one important point absolutely clear. Ethiopia is committed to the peace process and to the scrupulous implementation of the Algiers Agreement. This is how we intend to continue in the future. We want the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) to succeed.</div>
	<div class="p">However, success in this or in any other conflict situation cannot be achieved by the efforts of one of the parties alone. This describes the situation we are facing in the peace process between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Prudence dictates that we call a spade a spade. Eritrea is not complying with the Algiers Agreement, an agreement which we believe is fair and in the interest of both parties to protect.</div>
	<div class="p">The Temporary Security Zone established by the Algiers Agreement is required to be a demilitarized zone separating the two forces. This is the most critical provision of the Algiers Agreement, whose violation would logically unravel the whole peace process. Eritrea has continued to refuse to maintain the integrity of the Temporary Security Zone as a demilitarized buffer area between the two forces. Regrettably, this violation is taking place under UNMEE's nose. We have continued to complain, but in vain.</div>
	<div class="p">UNMEE might have felt that Eritrea's compliance would eventually be secured through appeasement and by ignoring Ethiopia's legitimate concern. But our experience has made it unmistakably clear that appeasement has never worked with Eritrea. And it is not working now. What we have started witnessing lately is an ever-increasing mobilization of troops by Eritrea along the common border. Under these circumstances, lack of vigilance on the part of UNMEE and its policy of appeasement appears to be making another round of fighting close to inevitable. The Eritrean authorities might have felt that tension along the common border is useful in the light of domestic political necessities. It might serve a purpose for diverting popular attention from the domestic front, but it is manifestly reckless and dangerous. Under the circumstances, we call on the United Nations, as a co-guarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement, to shoulder its full responsibility to ensure that the Agreement is scrupulously followed. The Security Council should send an unambiguous message to Eritrea to immediately desist from all actions that endanger the peace process.</div>
	<div class="p">UNMEE needs to wake up and take Ethiopia's real concern seriously. Let there be no doubt about Ethiopia's continuing commitment to the scrupulous observance of the Algiers Agreement and to the peace process. Ethiopia will continue to do this faithfully. Ethiopia is also equally determined to respond to real threats, and reserves its right to act in self-defence.</div>

	The Acting President
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I now call on His Excellency Mr. Mervyn Assam, Minister for Enterprise Development and Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="24-8">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Assam" nation="Trinidad and Tobago" language="">
	Mr. Assam (Trinidad and Tobago)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Trinidad and Tobago would like to congratulate the President on his election to preside over the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His unanimous endorsement by both his regional group and all Member States is testimony of the high esteem in which he and his country are held by the Organization. He may rest assured of the full cooperation of my delegation as he engages in the task of presiding over the work of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Trinidad and Tobago takes this opportunity to thank Mr. Harri Holkeri, President of the Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, for the skilful manner in which he guided the Organization during his tenure.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation also congratulates the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to serve this body for a second term. Mr. Annan has brought a unique vision and a sense of purpose to the United Nations, engendering in the Organization a renewed spirit to address the issues confronting the international community at the dawn of this century. In so doing he has sought to put the basic rights and collective aspirations of human beings at the centre of the work of the United Nations. It is not surprising therefore that both Mr. Annan and the Organization that he so effectively heads should this year be recipients of one of the world's most coveted and prestigious awards, the Nobel Prize for Peace. Trinidad and Tobago extends to them its most sincere congratulations.</div>
	<div class="p">It is with an equal sense of pride that I also feel compelled to mention that the twin island State of Trinidad and Tobago is the birthplace of another of this year's Nobel laureates, Sir Vidiadhar Naipaul, recipient of the Prize for Literature.</div>
	<div class="p">It is propitious that 2001 was proclaimed the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations by the General Assembly. It is a clear acknowledgement by the international community that it is only through dialogue that the voices of diverse peoples, and their approaches to the many challenges that face them, find expression. Indeed, tolerance and respect for diversity remain key components of the strategies that must be developed to address these concerns. Dialogue that is fair and free of fear speaks not merely of a civilized society but of a society that will endure. History will judge us, not by our so-called progress, but by what we as people, as nation States and as a world community allow to endure.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, the fundamental values enshrined in the Millennium Declaration are so integral to this process that they can never be overemphasized. They provide the much needed guidance required in maintaining focus and commitment as we strive to address these global challenges. Indeed, in the context of unfolding world events, there appears to be a greater and more urgent need to recommit ourselves to the values inherent in dialogue among nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Two months ago, in our host city of New York, in Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania, the world witnessed the most heinous terrorist assault. Many Member States, including my own, count their citizens among the victims. We have all been affected by the diverse and widening repercussions of that assault. It was a harsh and tragic reminder that we live in a global environment and that events in one country can have an impact on each and every one of us.</div>
	<div class="p">We must recognize those vicious acts for what they are. No country is immune from terrorism. We have a collective responsibility to send a strong and clear message that such acts will not go unpunished. Action has been initiated to counter them. Member States must therefore pursue with renewed vigour, at the national and international levels, all appropriate measures designed to combat this scourge against mankind. In keeping with this stance, Trinidad and Tobago has already acceded to 11 of the international conventions against terrorism. Trinidad and Tobago vehemently condemns terrorism in all its manifestations, wherever it occurs.</div>
	<div class="p">Acts of terrorism have their origin in the hearts and minds of the misguided. There are now looming threats of recourse to bioterrorism, chemical warfare and even nuclear weapons. The international community should not delude itself that conventional tactics will return that sense of security that many parts of the world enjoyed prior to 11 September. A world forum like the United Nations must address the fundamental underlying causes -- the social, economic, political and psychological conditions that provide a fertile breeding ground for terrorism. We have a moral responsibility to our citizens, to our children and to coming generations, to make the world a better place for them by denying the terrorist his use of fear and intimidation.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me extend, on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, our condolences to those who lost their lives in the recent tragic aeroplane crash.</div>
	<div class="p">Despite the gravity and topical nature of the phenomenon of terrorism, we cannot allow the spectre of terrorism to deter us in our sense of purpose as we pursue developmental objectives aimed at the betterment of our peoples. Neither should we allow it to deflect attention from other activities which impact just as negatively on our societies, such as the illicit drug trade and the illegal trade in small arms. For its part, my Government has enacted legislation authorizing the confiscation of the assets resulting from drug trafficking. In like manner, existing legislation will be strengthened and relevant measures put in place as part of my country's contribution to the international effort in the fight against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">It is this very need to preserve democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, that spurred the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to propose, in 1989, a renewed focus on the establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court. We will continue our efforts to have the crimes of illegal drug trafficking and terrorism included within the jurisdiction of the Court.</div>
	<div class="p">At the national level, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago recognizes the need also to maintain a focus on promoting economic growth and creating a better quality of life for all its citizens as key elements in preserving democracy. In this context, the Government has identified nine key objectives aimed at creating a healthier, better educated and highly skilled nation, capable of fully participating in the life of the national community and the wider global society. But even as we pursue these objectives, we know that, as a small island developing State, we have special needs and vulnerabilities. Therefore what is required is a supportive, regional and global environment. That is why we accord special significance to the achievements of the various development targets set out at last year's Millennium Summit. As a small island developing State, we would like to remind this Assembly of the Summit's resolve to implement, rapidly and in full, the 1994 Barbados Programme of Action and the 1999 outcome of the twenty-second special session of the General Assembly pertaining to the needs of small island developing States.</div>
	<div class="p">Trinidad and Tobago is also of the view that trade remains one of the essential elements for our economic growth. While safety and security concerns have become a priority, the onus is still on the international community to guarantee the strength and stability of commodity prices, on which the majority of developing countries depend to finance their growth and development.</div>
	<div class="p">Consideration must also be given to extending debt relief to middle-income countries, as this will free resources otherwise allocated to debt servicing to assist in the financing of critical sectors, such as health and education. Trinidad and Tobago, for example, currently utilizes a significant portion of its gross domestic product to meet debt servicing requirements -- resources which would be better utilized in our fight against the AIDS pandemic, which is fast emerging as a major development challenge, not only for Trinidad and Tobago, but for many of our sister islands in the Caribbean and elsewhere in the world.</div>
	<div class="p">Resource mobilization at the national, regional and international levels is central to the development of small island States. Trinidad and Tobago has consequently given priority to the mobilization of domestic resources within an overall macroeconomic policy which encourages the creation of a competitive business environment.</div>
	<div class="p">Success in domestic resource mobilization is, however, heavily dependent on the external environment and linked to success in accessing the markets of developed countries. Many of the factors which impinge on the process of attracting foreign capital lie outside the control of developing countries. Trinidad and Tobago faces the particular problem of attracting foreign investment in the non-oil sector, which affects the overall development of the social infrastructure. Foreign direct investment also tends to flow where profits are highest, not necessarily where a sound policy for the creation of a hospitable local environment has been instituted.</div>
	<div class="p">Of equal significance for developing States is next year's International Conference on Financing for Development, at which the central issue of reforming the decision-making system will be under review. International financial institutions, for their own part, must therefore work to ensure that developing countries are allowed to participate more fully in all policy decisions which directly affect them.</div>
	<div class="p">Similarly, the special and differential treatment provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements must be implemented if developing countries are to maximize their potential gains of trade. Trinidad and Tobago is convinced of the need for the WTO to recognize the differences in the levels of development capacity which exist among its members, including developing States. Our position on this issue was clearly enunciated at the just concluded Doha ministerial meeting. Trinidad and Tobago therefore welcomes the agreement reached at that meeting to make special and differential treatment operationally effective to facilitate development and to ensure that modalities for further commitments, including provisions for special and differential treatment, are established by 31 March 2003. We also welcome agreement on a work programme to examine issues related to the trade of small economies for the fuller integration of small and vulnerable economies into the multilateral trading system. We will remain actively engaged as the process unfolds.</div>
	<div class="p">To Trinidad and Tobago, as a member of the African-Caribbean-Pacific Group of States (ACP), of critical concern, too, is the inordinate and unjustifiable delay in granting the waiver request for the ACP/ European Commission Partnership Agreement. It is an issue which has serious systemic implications for the Organization and it is for this reason that Trinidad and Tobago, like fellow ACP members, considered it imperative that it be addressed at the ministerial conference.</div>
	<div class="p">In the sphere of health, no one would dispute that a real connection exists between a nation's development capacity and the health of its people. In this regard, my Government has noted with special interest the call to strengthen the resolve adopted at the Millennium Summit to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. At the heart of our concern is the fact that the Caribbean region ranks second among the regions of the world where AIDS is the leading cause of death in the 15 to 44 age group, a distinction our region can ill afford to bear.</div>
	<div class="p">Trinidad and Tobago again demonstrated its own commitment to international efforts by hosting last month the Tenth International Conference for People Living with HIV/AIDS. Further, Trinidad and Tobago was among those countries specially selected to participate in phase II of the HIV/AIDS vaccine trials, which aims to develop a safe, affordable and accessible vaccine. The Government, too, has successfully negotiated with pharmaceutical companies a 90 per cent reduction in the cost of antiretroviral drugs. Trinidad and Tobago also supports the establishment of the Global Fund for AIDS and Health. As a member of the Transitional Working Group of the Fund, we will seek to ensure that, in the modalities of the Fund, accession will not be burdensome and bureaucratic and that special consideration will be given to the most seriously affected countries.</div>
	<div class="p">Another element in the pervading cycle of underdevelopment is the presence of persistent poverty. Trinidad and Tobago fully supports the call of heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit to strive to cut in half by 2015 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. At the State level, Trinidad and Tobago's progress in the area of poverty eradication is illustrated by the high ranking it has enjoyed since 1977 in the United Nations Human Development Index.</div>
	<div class="p">Likewise, Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to the agreement on the economic and environmental goals of the United Nations. We therefore welcome the agreements reached at the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, especially the establishment of a special climate fund, a fund for least developed countries and the Kyoto Protocol adaptation fund to be established in order to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes. We now encourage developed countries to ratify the Protocol so that it can enter into force as quickly as possible.</div>
	<div class="p">As a small island State which relies heavily on the marine environment for our petroleum, natural gas, fishing and tourism industries, we are also committed to upholding the principles and fulfilling the obligations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We support the work of the International Seabed Authority in respect of the development and exploitation of minerals of the deep seabed for the benefit all humankind. In our quest to ensure the preservation of the marine environment, we reiterate that the question of the transhipment of hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea is a cause of deep concern to the region since, in many instances, the marine environment constitutes the only meaningful resource on which some States depend for their very economic existence.</div>
	<div class="p">Against a landscape of differing stages of development, of differing cultural perspectives and of disparate and competing interests, what does emerge is an undeniable strength of purpose within this body that unites us all in a shared commitment not only to improving the standard of human life, but to preserving it at all costs. Harnessing this strength of purpose ultimately depends on every Member State's appreciating its inherent value and the value it adds by its participation in the work of forums such as these. It is for this reason that we must continue the dialogue, albeit more vigorously, to ensure that the interests of peace and security are better served. Reform of the Security Council must therefore be advanced in a meaningful way. Democratization of the Security Council will require more equitable representation. This goal can be accomplished only through the expansion of the Council in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories.</div>
	<div class="p">The task before us is not insurmountable. We must deepen the dialogue to accelerate implementation of the goals defined at the Millennium Summit and specified in the various global conferences and reviews which have taken place to date. We must ensure that the process of implementation is conducted within a spirit of equity and justice. Equal attention must be given to all groups of countries, developed and developing, large and small, landlocked, transit and small island developing States. Trinidad and Tobago remains fully committed to this process. Let us make this fifty-sixth session one of defining the process of implementation.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Ela Ebang" nation="Equatorial Guinea" language="Spanish">
	Mr. Ela Ebang (Equatorial Guinea)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me at the outset to express our deep satisfaction at seeing Mr. Han Seung-soo presiding over the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. For my delegation, the peaceable nature and spirit of dialogue that identify and distinguish his country, the Republic of Korea, together with his outstanding qualities as a diplomat and tireless negotiator -- all of which he has demonstrated since the beginning of this session -- are guarantees for the success of our work. He can rely on the support and cooperation of Equatorial Guinea.</div>
	<div class="p">To the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, we wish to express our sincere congratulations on his re-election for a second term to lead the United Nations and the distinction conferred on him and the United Nations as recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize. We also commend the clear-sightedness and resolve that he has shown in exercising his responsibilities to revitalize this Organization and confirm its role at a time in which peace, security, stability, development and understanding are increasingly precarious. We wish the Secretary-General every success in his endeavours to carry out the purposes enshrined in the Charter. To this end, he may rely on our full trust and support.</div>
	<div class="p">I would not wish to proceed any further with my statement without first expressing our most sincere and profound condolences to the Government and fraternal people of the Dominican Republic and to all the families that have been affected by the tragic and appalling plane crash that occurred on 12 November 2001. May God receive all the victims into his kingdom.</div>
	<div class="p">This regular session of the General Assembly has been one of mourning, because it is taking place at a time when the international community, without exception, feels that it is being dragged back towards a past that it thought had receded into oblivion. Now, more than ever, since 11 September 2001, the need for security, stability, justice, equity and balance has become a vital imperative and the highest of priorities.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly is faced with a dilemma: to evaluate the level of implementation of the commitments undertaken in the framework of the Declaration of the Millennium Summit and at the special sessions of the General Assembly, before and after the Summit, and other international conferences, with a view to adopting the new strategies required, in the light of the failures that have been registered in various fields of activity, while at the same time, tuning up and activating all the mechanisms required for the struggle against and eradication of terrorism, since this is a common enemy, with no identifiable face or location.</div>
	<div class="p">Peoples and their Governments constantly face the arduous, complex and inescapable obligation and duty to adapt to new realities and demands that loom ahead in the immediate or remote future. For this reason, Equatorial Guinea concurs with and maintains the opinion that this task cannot and should not rest on the shoulders of one people or one Government or any individual country in an isolated fashion. It should be borne within a collective body such as the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe and maintain that the United Nations continues to be the best option and best centre for indispensable agreements, with all the wealth that its diversity brings, for the purposes of conflict prevention, crisis management, rapprochement among peoples and enhancement of cooperation among States on the bilateral, subregional, regional and intercontinental levels. For this reason, the Organization must be endowed with the means it requires to organize international society, working to combat intolerance, persistent tension and conflict and the worsening economic situation of poor countries.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, in the light of recent positive experiences, we advocate greater, closer and more effective cooperation between the United Nations and regional integration groupings, in general, and with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), in particular.</div>
	<div class="p">Together with the need to give the United Nations the means to enhance its capacity, we believe that the time is likewise ripe for both States and international organizations, including the financial agencies, to take specific and positive steps, without delay, aimed at democratizing international relations, promoting and reaffirming respect for human rights and consolidating the disarmament regime and directing the investment of military expenditures to international action to promote development. Equatorial Guinea is continuing to work towards these objectives through an institutionalized national dialogue involving the political forces of the country.</div>
	<div class="p">Equatorial Guinea shares in and insists on the vital need to democratize the Security Council, setting up the greatest possible interlocking and coordination between the work and tasks of that body and the responsibilities of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">In spite of the success that has been achieved in some countries and regions in the area of peacekeeping and peace-building, it is still disquieting to note that these successes have served as culture media that have encouraged areas of tension to persist indefinitely or allowed other threats to peace to erupt. In fact, as the United Nations is redoubling and improving the efforts of peacekeeping and peace-building missions, the Secretary-General has noted in his report on the work of the Organization: "Global military expenditures have continued to rise ... Although official development assistance levels have continued to fall ... military budgets have risen persistently." (<i><a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-1">A/56/1</a>, para. 76</i>)</div>
	<div class="p">The same concern about the absence of peace applies to the sorry and disheartening aspect of cooperation to eradicate poverty. For the United Nations and its Development Group and certain non-governmental organizations are striving to translate into reality the decision taken at the Millennium Summit to combat poverty and make globalization an inclusive and not exclusive phenomenon.</div>
	<div class="p">Equatorial Guinea associates itself with the principle of shared responsibility, taking the standpoint that the problems that continue to face the least developed countries are indeed the cause of the lack of progress achieved in working towards international objectives of human and social development. We hope and trust that the Brussels Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 and the outcome of the International Conference on Financing for Development, scheduled to be held in Monterrey, Mexico in May 2002, and other pertinent instruments will lay the best possible bases for effective cooperation for development.</div>
	<div class="p">As I noted earlier, Equatorial Guinea expresses its satisfaction at the reduction of tensions in some countries and regions. At the same time, it calls on and encourages the parties involved in areas where conflicts and disputes are born and persist to redouble their efforts and to use their capabilities and potential to seek peaceful solutions through peaceful negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p">In this context, Equatorial Guinea reaffirms that the People's Republic of China is the sole State entity that is representative of the Chinese people.</div>
	<div class="p">We also welcome the recent initiative to resume the North-South dialogue for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula, and we support the principles endorsed and the responsibilities assumed by the Governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea.</div>
	<div class="p">At a time when the United Nations is fully engaged in the search for solutions to alleviate the many evils besetting peoples in all corners of the world, through the adoption of strategies and programmes of action to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic to mention just one example, the illegal traffic in weapons and drugs, drug addiction, the mortgaging of the lives of children through their traffic and easy recruitment into the armed forces, discrimination against women, and so forth, the international community's attention has been diverted by unusual events such as the unprecedented terrorist act of 11 September 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">The acts carried out against the United States of America on 11 September were undoubtedly attacks against the United Nations. The prevailing atmosphere of the current session of the General Assembly, a year after the adoption of the Millennium Declaration by an unprecedented attendance of 147 heads of State and Government and a total of 189 Member States, and the temporary postponement until next year of the General Assembly's special session on children are eloquent examples, among others, of the challenge and the dilemma faced by the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">In that context, we reiterate the most vigorous condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and facets, and we reaffirm the Republic of Equatorial Guinea's full support for and solidarity with the people and Government of the United States of America at this painful and worrisome time, which will be difficult to forget.</div>
	<div class="p">The country's competent constitutional organs are currently adopting measures for the integration of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea into existing relevant international conventions on the prevention and suppression of international terrorism, as part of its response to the Joint Declaration on Terrorism, adopted in Brussels on 11 October, and the Dakar Declaration against Terrorism, signed on 17 October 2001, as well as relevant resolutions of the Security Council.</div>
	<div class="p">As the Secretary-General's report forcefully points out, the Millennium Declaration insists on the need to promote and intensify institutional cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"In an increasing globalized world, none of the critical issues we are dealing with can be resolved within a solely national framework. All of them require cooperation, partnership and burden-sharing among Governments, the United Nations, regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and civil society." (<i><a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-1">A/56/1</a>, para. 11</i>)</div>
	<div class="p">In this context, and on behalf of the member States of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), over which Equatorial Guinea is presiding, we reiterate our deepest recognition of the great support offered by United Nations Member States with respect to resolutions 55/22 and 55/161, on cooperation between the Organization of the United Nations and ECCAS and the observer status conferred on the latter organization.</div>
	<div class="p">Given the prevalence of the informed political will of ECCAS States to put an end to conflicts, the loss of innocent lives, the destruction of economic and social infrastructures and extreme poverty in rural areas, we hope and are convinced that the General Assembly will once again pronounce itself in favour of the implementation and improvement of cooperation between the United Nations and ECCAS in order that the latter may direct its potential -- individual and collective -- towards alleviating the new challenges stemming from globalization and liberalization, for the economies of the subregion. This would enhance the path to democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law in the subregion, within the context of the excellent and tireless work being carried out by the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">I would be remiss if I did not, on behalf of the President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, His Excellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, convey to the Assembly his greetings and sincere wishes for success and prosperity to each and every participant. His Excellency had expressed his wish to attend, and regrets not being able to be present at these deliberations.</div>

	Mr. Donigi (Papua New Guinea)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On behalf of the people and Government of Papua New Guinea, I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating the President on his election to this prestigious post.</div>
	<div class="p">His election shows the high esteem in which the international community holds both him personally and his country, the Republic of Korea.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation is confident that, through his great diplomatic skills and leadership, which is already evident, he will continue to guide the work of this session of the General Assembly to its successful conclusion.</div>
	<div class="p">I also take this opportunity, through him, to express my delegation's sincere appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his outstanding leadership and stewardship in facilitating the work of the historic Millennium Summit and the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">We also congratulate and pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his re-election to the office of Secretary-General of the United Nations and for the award of the Nobel Peace Prize.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea is resolute in its commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Papua New Guinea acknowledges the value of many of the United Nations treaties and declarations, including those that advance human rights, the rule of law and good governance. Many of these principles are enumerated in our national Constitution.</div>
	<div class="p">We acknowledge that the Organization has had some limitations, many of which are self-inflicted. We note that the United Nations is now in a much healthier financial position than ever before. However, there is no room for complacency in the pursuit of its reform programme. The United Nations bodies and systems must be restructured to reflect new dynamics and geopolitical changes and to create hope for all at the beginning of the new millennium.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe that our common global and regional problems cannot be resolved under the auspices of violence, terrorism, war and destruction; nor can they be resolved in a vacuum. The United Nations provides a forum and an avenue for fostering dialogue for peaceful resolution of disputes.</div>
	<div class="p">An effective Security Council, we believe, should be representative of all subregions of the world. My Government also believes that the use of the veto power should be limited to Chapter VII issues, while the working methods and deliberations of the Council should be more transparent and democratic.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea's development aspirations have been compromised by problems associated with the downturn in the global economy, the economic crisis within the Asia-Pacific region and natural disasters, over all of which we have little control. The Government has addressed these challenges through a comprehensive programme of structural adjustments. We have worked hard to make sure that these structural adjustments are made in the public sector in order to stimulate and expand growth in the private sector.</div>
	<div class="p">The measures we have adopted have stabilized the economy. However, as we look into the future, we cannot but hope that the incidents of 11 September will not unduly affect our future recovery. Judging by the evidence of a downturn in the United States economy, it seems clear that every effort is required to make the International Conference on Financing for Development next year a success.</div>
	<div class="p">We are grateful to the Friends of Papua New Guinea group, comprising Australia, Japan, the European Commission and China, among others, which have been generous in assisting our Government in its development efforts. The World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank have also been very positive in their responses to our policies.</div>
	<div class="p">My country has experienced an unfortunate and terrible conflict and has been trying to build mutual confidence and security by pursuing a progressive political settlement, including through restoration and development for the past four years in its Bougainville Province. We have utilized the Melanesian way of building consensus between all parties to the conflict. The consensus is now reflected in the Bougainville Peace Agreement, signed by the parties on 30 August this year. The Government is resolute in its desire to implement the Agreement. It has completed work on drafting amendments to our Constitution to provide for greater autonomy, a referendum and amnesty. Together with ongoing efforts to implement other aspects of the Agreement, the parties are expected to facilitate progress on weapons disposal and associated issues, such as reconciliation and the unification of political and administrative structures in Bougainville. A special session of Parliament will be been convened next week, on 22 November, to continue to debate the Agreement. Parliament will deliberate on the constitutional amendments on or soon after 14 December this year.</div>
	<div class="p">We wish to place on record our deep appreciation to the United Nations, in particular Ambassador Noel Sinclair and his team on Bougainville, the United Nations Development Programme, the European Union, individual European Union members and the Governments of Australia, Fiji, Japan, New Zealand, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu for their continuing and constructive roles in Bougainville.</div>
	<div class="p">It is also my pleasure to speak on behalf of the Bougainville parties and the Government to thank the Secretary-General and all members of the Security Council, past and present, for continuing to renew the mandate of the United Nations Political Office in Bougainville. We are confident that the Security Council will continue to provide all the assistance we need with respect to arms collection, storage and disposal.</div>
	<div class="p">The process of decolonization will not be completed until the people of the remaining 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories have exercised their right to self-determination and/or achieved self-government.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea welcomes the cooperation of the Government of France with regard to the progress made in implementing the Nouméa Accords and setting in motion the eventual exercise of the right of self-determination by the people of New Caledonia, especially the indigenous Kanak people.</div>
	<div class="p">We acknowledge the full cooperation of the Government of New Zealand in the progress made so far with respect to the question of the Tokelau Islands.</div>
	<div class="p">My Government notes the progress made in East Timor. We heartily welcome the announcement of 20 May 2002 as the day the people of East Timor will attain independence and nationhood. We look forward to welcoming them as a full Member of this family of nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea continues to urge the other administering Powers to cooperate with the Special Political and Decolonization Committee in implementing and completing its mandate soon.</div>
	<div class="p">The future of each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories can be assured only by a positive, constructive and, above all, transparent approach to developing a unique solution for each of them.</div>
	<div class="p">The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly established the Consultative Process on oceans to improve the coordination and management of the programmes associated with the use, development and protection of the oceans and seas. The Consultative Process has been successful in bringing to the fore, and focusing the attention of Member States on, a number of issues.</div>
	<div class="p">The Pacific Islands Forum group includes small island developing States that are custodians of the largest ocean space. This ocean space is rich in natural and marine resources. However, the small island developing States of the region have limited human, financial and technological capacities to harvest, control, manage and secure these resources for the benefit of our current and future generations.</div>
	<div class="p">It has been said that to divert the poor from the call of the evil, it is not enough to appeal to their stomachs only. Rather, one must appeal to their aspirations as well. We joined others having particular interest in the sustainable use and management of the fish stocks in our region to establish the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean in September 2000. The next meeting of the signatories to this Convention will be held in Papua New Guinea early next year.</div>
	<div class="p">We welcome Malta's lodgement last Sunday of its instrument of ratification of the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. The Agreement, which will now come into force on 11 December 2001, called on States to cooperate to enhance the ability of developing States, in particular the least developed and small island developing States, to conserve and develop their own fisheries for such stocks. For all small island developing States in the Pacific, financing for development has to be linked to the development of their fisheries sector.</div>
	<div class="p">In order to emphasize my point, I have provided some data on the last page of my written statement. The Assembly will note that the Central and Western Pacific fishery is valued in excess of $2.5 billion per annum, while the Pacific small island developing States earn an average of only $66 million per annum in licensing fees. For the small island developing States of the Pacific to attain sustainable growth and development, this situation has to change.</div>
	<div class="p">Last year my delegation also welcomed the conclusion by the International Seabed Authority of the exploration code for seabed mining. Continuing work is to be undertaken with respect to a code for exploration for polymetallic sulfides and cobalt-rich crusts. Papua New Guinea has particular interest in polymetallic sulfides.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation would like to thank once again the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority, Ambassador Satya Nandan, for his report on the work of the Authority. We welcome the execution of contracts by pioneer investors and urge the remaining pioneer investor to follow suit as soon as possible.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea supports the principles contained in the Barbados Programme of Action and in Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We continue to support the principles contained in the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We once again stress the urgent need for developed countries to make a concerted effort to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation welcomes the achievements of part two of the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the climate change Convention, held at Bonn last July, and the successful completion of the recent seventh session of the Conference, held at Marrakesh, Morocco.</div>
	<div class="p">Another of the greatest challenges facing the United Nations is to strengthen the capacity of the global community to respond promptly and effectively to climate change and natural disaster. In 1997, Papua New Guinea experienced drought and frost caused by El Niño and in 1998 came the tsunami and the La Niña phenomenon, bringing floods and landslides and leaving death and destruction in their wake. We acknowledge the prompt and generous support of our neighbours in dealing with the effects of such disasters. Global warming has also brought increased numbers of cases of diseases such as malaria to the higher-altitude and most populous region of our country. The threat of increased incidence of malaria in that region is real, and could negatively affect the demographics of the country. There is definitely a link among climate change, natural disaster and the spread and increased incidence of disease.</div>
	<div class="p">Nor is Papua New Guinea exempt from the HIV/ AIDS epidemic or from tuberculosis. We are grateful to Australia and to other partners which have provided assistance in that field of health care. We also welcome again last year's announcement by the Japanese Government that it would set aside substantial financial resources for disease eradication programmes in developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p">The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development and the World Summit for Sustainable Development must be platforms for launching new and innovative methods for realigning the policies of the Bretton Woods institutions so that they focus more on development and on the eradication of poverty. There must be a concerted effort to link new and innovative financial instruments to the delivery of specific outcome-oriented approaches. There must be flexibility in assisting developing countries, especially small island, landlocked and least developed countries. As I have said before, for the peoples of the Pacific islands to become meaningful participants in the globalization process, new financial instruments and mechanisms should be developed to facilitate the transfer of technological capacity and expertise in the fisheries sector.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea is committed to peaceful dialogue among nations and condemns those that employ terrorism against people or that finance, recruit or train terrorists or mercenaries. The barbaric acts of 11 September have been described in many ways. Some have called them horrendous, despicable and the work of evil-doers. The use of any adjective to describe the horror and the continuing threat to human security only adds to the esteem in which some hold the perpetrators. The use of qualifiers to describe the innocence of the deceased lends legitimacy to those acts and shields the nakedness of their wilful and wrongful nature.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea condemns the 11 September attacks on the United States and supports the ongoing campaign by the United States and its allies against terrorism. On behalf of the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea, I convey our heartfelt condolences to the immediate families and other relatives of all those who had their lives brutally taken away from them in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. My Government is committed to implementing Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and is in the process of examining all existing conventions relating to terrorism with a view to acceding to them early next year.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea also notes the death several days ago of the political leader of the people of the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, Mr. Theys Eluay, under questionable circumstances. As a neighbouring country which shares a common border with that province, Papua New Guinea is concerned about the likely spillover effect of new developments in the province. We urge Indonesia to undertake a thorough, impartial and transparent investigation into Mr. Eluay's death, to make public the results and to bring to justice those responsible.</div>
	<div class="p">My Government is committed to a stable, peaceful and environmentally safe world and therefore supports the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. We call on all that have nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, including biological weapons, to stop testing, manufacturing and storing them, and furthermore to take steps to destroy them.</div>
	<div class="p">We also support efforts to ban transboundary movements of radioactive and other hazardous wastes through the Pacific region. We call on those States that previously conducted nuclear-weapon tests or that have discharged chemical or other non-degradable wastes in our subregion to adequately compensate and provide appropriate medical assistance to the scores of persons and families affected. Remedial action should be taken to clean up the damage done to the environment.</div>
	<div class="p">Global and regional partnerships to promote change are the key to addressing the challenges that the world will face in the twenty-first century. Papua New Guinea believes that a challenge for Member States is to reshape the Organization so that it can serve as an effective tool for implementing our collective desire: to make the global village a better place for all.</div>

	<div class="p">I now give the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Ellen Margrethe Løj, Chairperson of the delegation of Denmark.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="34-3">
<span class="speaker" name="Ms. Løj" nation="Denmark" language="">
	Ms. Løj (Denmark)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The Danish Government associates itself with the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium on behalf of the European Union.</div>
	<div class="p">On 11 September a brutal blow was delivered to the people of the United States of America. At the same time, it was a strike against the foundations of the United Nations and against its mission to secure peace and prosperity for mankind in a spirit of collaboration and shared values. Extremists have seen fit to take the lives of thousands of innocent people to press their message. The Danish people have reacted with outrage and sorrow. We strongly condemn the criminal and cowardly act; our thoughts and our compassion are with the victims, their families and their friends.</div>
	<div class="p">This year the Nobel Peace Prize went to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations. May I congratulate both the Secretary-General and the United Nations and its staff. The choice could not have been better or the timing more acute.</div>
	<div class="p">The horrific terrorist attack on the United States changed the agenda of the General Assembly. From the outset, the international community has demonstrated its resolve to confront the menace of terrorism. The General Assembly and the Security Council have passed resolutions unanimously condemning in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks, and countries and other international organizations have followed with a host of other initiatives to that end. The international community has stood up to the challenge united.</div>
	<div class="p">Denmark welcomes the broad coalition of countries that has rallied behind the United States response to the terrorist attacks in order to effectively bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">By acting together, by acting resolutely, by redoubling our efforts, we will stop the terror. At the international level, we need the United Nations to provide the norms and the international legal framework required to define and criminalize acts of terror. The United Nations has already put important parts of the legal machinery in place with the 12 existing conventions aimed at combating specific forms of terror. Furthermore, work is well under way towards a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">At the national level, countries must urgently take concrete steps to implement Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. States must have national legislation in place in order to prosecute persons supporting or committing acts of terrorism. At the same time, countries must be ready to take steps to preclude in all possible ways the operation and financing of terrorist networks within their territories. All countries should accede to and enforce the 12 conventions against international terrorism and should ensure prompt follow-up of Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Three weeks ago, the Danish Government submitted a draft bill on national follow-up in our Parliament, and I can assure the Assembly that Denmark will do its utmost to cooperate with the Counter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">These measures form part of our overall efforts to create a better world, in which human dignity is guaranteed and human rights and fundamental freedoms are fully respected. Indeed, recent events underscore further the need to make the world a better place, in particular for those vast groups of people who live in poverty. For poor people who see no possibility of improving their economic and social standing, turning to extremist religious and ideological views and networks may be tempting. We need to secure real political, economic and social opportunities for the world's poor and disadvantaged.</div>
	<div class="p">The goals identified by world leaders during the Millennium Summit give our work direction in the decades to come.</div>
	<div class="p">Armed conflicts cause inconceivable human suffering and material destruction and are often the main obstacles to development. An effective response to present-day conflicts requires a long-term political commitment from a united international community in the form of a diplomatic, political, economic, military and civil engagement. The United Nations is the international body vested with a universal mandate to secure support for conflict prevention. Often, it is also the only body capable of legitimate conflict management. Thus many people around the world are dependent on the effective and prompt reaction of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Fortunately, we have in recent years witnessed quite a number of successful United Nations operations. Let me single out three examples, in three different parts of the world.</div>
	<div class="p">First, in East Timor the United Nations presence has furthered political progress towards the building of a new nation State, set for May next year.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea has demonstrated the readiness of the international community to resolve conflicts and has strengthened the credibility of United Nations peacekeeping in Africa. That Mission also marked the first and successful deployment of the Multinational United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG).</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, the day after tomorrow is an important milestone for the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and for the people of Kosovo. Hopefully, the latter will participate in great numbers in the elections. The Danish Government has noted with satisfaction that both the Serbian and the Yugoslav Governments have endorsed Kosovo Serb participation in the elections.</div>
	<div class="p">However, other conflicts, not least in Africa, continue to cause tremendous suffering to the people affected and to challenge the international community. The prevention and management of violent conflicts have therefore become an integral part of Denmark's comprehensive engagement in developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations has a unique role to play in helping Afghanistan to rebuild itself and to re-enter the international community. Denmark strongly supports the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Brahimi. We are ready to contribute further to the ongoing relief and humanitarian efforts, as well as to the immense task that lies ahead: reconstructing Afghanistan.</div>
	<div class="p">A conflict of particular concern is that in the Middle East, which threatens to escalate beyond control. The Mitchell report and the Tenet Plan still provide important windows of opportunity. The United Nations, the European Union, the United States and neighbouring States must redouble their efforts to get the parties to take immediate action to stop the violence and to create the atmosphere necessary to restart negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p">The Millennium development goals provide the framework for each and every country to act in a concerted fashion on a range of key development challenges.</div>
	<div class="p">In this connection, I should like to refer to the Secretary-General's road map for the implementation of the Millennium Summit Declaration, in which he stated that we have just emerged from an era of commitment and stressed that we must now enter an era of implementation. This timely reminder has our full support.</div>
	<div class="p">The last 10 years have seen more countries than ever before commit themselves to a democratic and accountable political system. This trend is encouraging. Open societies committed to democracy are more likely to respect the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms and to foster accountable governments. National responsibilities for development, as expressed through good governance and the promotion of human rights and democracy, are key to the peaceful settlement of conflicts and essential tools for economic development. The New Partnership for Africa's Development is an encouraging step in this direction.</div>
	<div class="p">In building on these positive trends, we must go even further. We must take concerted steps forward on a whole range of key issues, from security, human rights and trade to development.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, our planning prior to 11 September is now showing unexpected rewards. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Doha, the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, and the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg are all part of the same, global process. They are a unique opportunity for us to show that multilateral cooperation in the economic field can make a difference and that we can achieve globalization with a human face.</div>
	<div class="p">Our primary target is clearly to eradicate poverty. This objective should be at the heart of the international effort in the coming weeks and months. We need a "Global Deal" that encompasses all human beings, with the aim of achieving long-term sustainable development, based on global coherence between economic, social and environmental policies.</div>
	<div class="p">Thus, we need partnerships between developed and developing countries; between all development actors, including the wider United Nations family, comprising the WTO, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and drawing upon civil society and the private sector. All partners need to be on board to achieve a balance between national, international and systemic endeavours.</div>
	<div class="p">The Financing for Development Conference in Mexico, to be held in March 2002, is a first and important opportunity to demonstrate our new resolve on development. We could leave Monterrey with important elements of a global framework that would help us pull an unprecedented number of people out of poverty over the coming 15 years. The human and security benefits at stake are compelling.</div>
	<div class="p">We face a great responsibility in the days, weeks and months ahead. Both developed and developing countries need to set their priorities straight in order to strike this Global Deal. In that sense, a global commitment to realizing the national potential for development of the developing countries should be met, in the spirit of partnership, by the developed countries, with full support for reaching these goals.</div>
	<div class="p">We also reiterate the call on the industrialized countries to grant more generous development assistance and to increase their official development assistance so that, as a minimum, it reaches the established United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product that is necessary to achieve the Millennium goals.</div>
	<div class="p">Recent events have demonstrated that international cooperation is indispensable. The United Nations is the right forum for dealing with many of these challenges. Let us equip the Organization to meet them effectively. By closing a Global Deal, we can take development forward on the broad front.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="36-8">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Guna-Kasem" nation="Thailand" language="">
	Mr. Guna-Kasem (Thailand)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It is an honour for me to deliver this statement on behalf of Mr. Surakiart Sathirathai, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand. Allow me to join all previous speakers in expressing our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or suffered from the tragic incidents of 11 September 2001. The people and Government of Thailand share the feelings of sorrow and outrage caused by those acts of terrorism. Our condolences go to the people and Government of the United States.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to extend my congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency for the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly and express my full confidence that, under his guidance, we shall be able to build upon the United Nations Millennium Declaration and accomplish our goals of bringing peace, prosperity and well-being to this world.</div>
	<div class="p">I also wish to express our warmest congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his being conferred the Nobel Peace Prize, together with the United Nations, as well as on his re-election as Secretary-General. This prestigious recognition has been made because of the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General himself and of the dedicated United Nations staff. The achievement of the Secretary-General is noted in his Millennium Report, which encapsulates the United Nations activities ahead, outlines the framework for the tasks and focuses on people as the centre of development, both at the international and national levels.</div>
	<div class="p">After the events of 11 September 2001, the shared destiny of the world will depend greatly on how we manage to cope with these emerging new realities and growing complexities. No country is truly safe from terrorism and no one is capable of fighting it alone. Now is the time for every nation to contribute and participate in the joint efforts to combat terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">In Thailand, we resolutely condemn all forms of terrorism and are fully supportive of all the international community's efforts to combat this grave threat to global peace and security. Thailand supports all actions against terrorism in the framework of the United Nations and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and international law. We have extended cooperation to the international community through existing laws, such as those on mutual assistance in criminal matters in the form of information exchange and intelligence sharing. The Thai Government is amending existing domestic legislation and regulations to enable the country to be party to relevant international conventions, especially the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">At the regional level, Thailand has participated actively in the recent regional gatherings at the highest level, where international terrorism received a high priority, namely the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Meeting in Shanghai. We joined other APEC leaders in expressing grave concern over the threat to world peace and the stability of the world economy caused by terrorism and in reaffirming a renewed sense of urgency to restore confidence to the global economy.</div>
	<div class="p">At the 7th Summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 5 November 2001 in Brunei Darussalam, ASEAN leaders issued a declaration outlining specific measures to further strengthen cooperation to deal with the threat of terrorism in the region. Measures proposed include the enhancement of intelligence exchange and the deepening of cooperation among law enforcement agencies. ASEAN leaders also stressed the need to strengthen cooperation with ASEAN Dialogue Partners and within the framework of the ASEAN Regional Forum and affirmed that the United Nations should play a major role in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p">My country, Thailand, supports a ministerial-level international conference on international terrorism, under the auspices of the United Nations, to be held at the earliest opportunity. This should facilitate the discussion of problems and cooperation on antiterrorism, leading to possible concrete measures at the global level. Terrorism should not be identified with any ethnic group, faith, or nationality. Otherwise, our efforts could result in greater danger for our peoples.</div>
	<div class="p">International terrorism has also exacerbated the slowdown in the global economy. This carries with it significant social ramifications as well. Airlines, tourism and related industries worldwide have felt the impact of international tension. Countries already struggling to recover from the recent economic slowdown are preparing to safeguard their economies from sliding further into sluggishness. Confronted with the ever widening gap between developed and developing countries, the United Nations and Member States must work together to arrest and reverse this trend.</div>
	<div class="p">The efforts to bridge the gap must not be confined to the United Nations framework alone. The World Trade Organization meeting in Doha, Qatar, which was just concluded, was a timely opportunity in which nations proved that they could work together and achieve substantial progress in pushing forward the global trade agenda for the common good of the world.</div>
	<div class="p">Since assuming office early this year, the present Thai Government has been pursuing a new approach to economic and social policy. The Thai Government has introduced a series of economic and social schemes aimed at promoting the capacity-building of the people at the grass-roots level. For instance, it has established the People's Bank and microcredit schemes for both the rural and the urban poor. This is to assist each community by financing small, local projects so as to develop and market a community's own products based on local know-how. In addition, more than 2 million small-scale Thai farmers will benefit from the Government's debt suspension scheme and a nationwide health insurance scheme.</div>
	<div class="p">On the issue of Afghanistan, the United Nations and the international community, in collaboration with the Afghans themselves, must move quickly to formulate modalities that would help restore order and stability. We should also render all possible assistance to Afghanistan, starting with assistance of a humanitarian nature at this crucial time and assistance aimed at capacity-building in the near future. Thailand, for its part, will provide a fairly large amount of rice -- approximately 3,000 metric tons -- as food relief for the Afghans. The Thai Red Cross has also donated 10,000 blankets.</div>
	<div class="p">Within our own region of South-East Asia, Thailand has reinvigorated bilateral relations with our immediate neighbours and has cooperated closely in pursuing a common vision of opening borders. We have also decided to establish joint production bases and transportation linkages. These initiatives carry on the momentum begun last year when the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) adopted a resolution proposed by Thailand on the "Decade of Greater Mekong Subregion Development Cooperation, 2000-2009". This subregion has been placed at the forefront of the Asia-Pacific development agenda. In addition, Thailand also has a role in keeping peace in the region. We take special pride in the fact that two Thai Generals have successively served as Force Commanders of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), the successor operation to the International Force in East Timor (INTERFET). This is part and parcel of Thailand's commitment to shouldering its fair share of international responsibility, particularly in South-East Asia.</div>
	<div class="p">We envisage the United Nations playing a major role in strengthening the foundation for a future world that will be peaceful, tolerant, and sustainable for our peoples and future generations. Therefore, Thailand is fully supportive of the United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations and participated actively in the recently concluded World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance held in Durban, South Africa.</div>
	<div class="p">As we celebrate the fifty-sixth anniversary of the United Nations, and as we congratulate the Secretary-General and the Organization, we must ask ourselves: what do we expect of the United Nations? I believe we expect it to work even harder towards cultivating a culture of peace, as well as improving the pace of international social and economic development. In these endeavours, we believe that rich and poor nations alike must contribute in their varied capacities. These national efforts must go hand in hand with those of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Let us focus on the immediate priorities of maintaining peace and harmony in the world. Let us pledge to work together with even greater vigour for the political, economic, social, and physical well-being of our peoples. These are, and should be, the enduring priorities for the United Nations and for all humankind.</div>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="38-5">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Huntley" nation="Saint Lucia" language="">
	Mr. Huntley (Saint Lucia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me first to offer the congratulations of the delegation of Saint Lucia to the President of the General Assembly on his election. We wish to assure him of our full support for the successful outcome of these deliberations.</div>
	<div class="p">As we meet with the global fraternity of nations during this fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, Saint Lucia once more joins its voice with those who have deplored and condemned the despicable acts of terror of 11 September 2001, that so brutalized our great host city, New York, and our host country, as they cruelly and callously extinguished thousands of innocent and vibrant lives. We are however heartened by the universal resolve of all peace-loving nations to rid the earth of the scourge of terrorism. We have noted, too, how quickly and steadfastly some of these nations have come together as a coalition in pursuit of that endeavour and have embarked on a war against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">We should, however, recognize that the defeat of this type of terrorism, as laudable and desirable an act as it may be, will not by itself create a greater humanity or a better world. For there are billions in the world today who have not been at war, but who have not known peace; they suffer from other terrors. There are millions, so many of whom are children, who succumb daily to the horrors of malnutrition and starvation. There are still millions of others who are wasting away from disease. Thousands of people see their human rights violated on a daily basis. We therefore need to remind ourselves that there are many other issues that have been engendering their own brand of fear and conflict in the world today, and that more often than not the underlying cause of such conflict is the lack of economic and human development.</div>
	<div class="p">If we are to attain greater humanity, and if we are to create a better world, we must commit ourselves to a greater collective responsibility towards all those other issues. We must adopt the same rapid global militaristic response to solving them as that in the new war on terrorism. Some of these issues have been with us for too long and by now should have disappeared from the world agenda. Our fragile humanity cannot endure another century of widening disparity between and within nations. We can no longer withstand the silent battle between the haves and the have nots. Humanity cannot tolerate ever increasing disease, deprivation, hunger, illiteracy, poverty, economic strife and war.</div>
	<div class="p">For the ideal of a greater humanity not to continue to elude us, we must now found it on this new attitude, this new vision, in which people everywhere, nations everywhere, are galvanized into higher levels of cooperation in pursuit of these common concerns, in particular concerns such as the guarantee of economic and social security, sustainable development and governance of the multilateral trading system. In this new philosophy of cooperation, the United Nations must play the central role.</div>
	<div class="p">It is from this perspective that Saint Lucia reiterates its call for the adoption of a holistic approach towards poverty eradication. Saint Lucia is firm in its view that the United Nations is the only Organization capable of pooling the requisite knowledge and financial resources for global action against poverty. International cooperation on poverty eradication must give due consideration to, among other things, debt forgiveness through concerted support for an improved Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. It must ensure special and differential treatment on a contractual basis for developing countries and sustained financial support for the Organization's development programmes.</div>
	<div class="p">The HIV/AIDS plague, which continues to ravage the world, also demands this new collective response. Saint Lucia acknowledges that the United Nations has already begun spearheading the global fight against HIV/AIDS. The United Nations special session on HIV/AIDS has done a great deal to raise global awareness about the magnitude of the pandemic. Saint Lucia also welcomes the establishment of the Global AIDS and Health Fund, which is intended to increase the ability of the global community to combat this scourge. However, if humanity is to win the fight against this twentieth century plague, the international community must make available new and additional financial resources towards research and the development of affordable drugs. We stress that these drugs must be cheap and widely obtainable. It is time that corporations cease putting the acquisition of more and more profit ahead of the health and lives of the unfortunate who have been afflicted by diseases such as AIDS. Are we not being inhumane when our overriding objective is to make as huge a profit as possible on the sickness of so many, rather than ensuring that the essential drugs that they need to end their suffering are easily available?</div>
	<div class="p">As we survey the multilateral trading system, Saint Lucia continues to be concerned that the thrust towards allowing market forces to totally determine the scope, structure and outcomes of economic activity is not being counterbalanced by mechanisms to fairly distribute welfare gains and to protect the more vulnerable, small States like Saint Lucia from the consequences of market failure.</div>
	<div class="p">The perilous state of the banana industry in Saint Lucia and the other Windward Islands of the Eastern Caribbean is the painful outcome of that thrust, an ill-advised policy of globalization and trade liberalization at all costs. The charge of World Trade Organization (WTO) incompatibility that was made against the preferential trade regime, justly accorded to Saint Lucia and other Agricultural Commodities Committee banana-producing countries under the Lomé Agreement, has brought about the near collapse of this vital industry. Saint Lucia welcomes the recent initiative by the United States for a new licensing agreement for the trading of bananas on the European market, an initiative that brought an end to the debilitating banana war with Europe.</div>
	<div class="p">Saint Lucia once more wishes to place on record its deep appreciation for the perseverance and fortitude of the European Union, which stood by its international obligations throughout these years of dispute. We applaud the news just in from Doha that, after 18 months, a WTO waiver has finally been granted to the Cotonou Agreement, thus paving the way for the implementation of the new banana-marketing arrangements. We hope that these recent developments are not too late to save our industry. But the case of the great banana dispute will always remain as a striking testimony to the inequities of the liberalized trading system.</div>
	<div class="p">Saint Lucia is also concerned about the actions of several organizations, such as the World Economic Council and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which seem to be attempting to usurp the traditional roles and functions of the United Nations and of national Governments. In the face of the near demise of the vital banana industry, Saint Lucia and the other islands of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) sought to diversify their economies by building on their competitive advantage in offshore financial services. But OECD countries denounced our efforts as being harmful to them, and resorted to branding Caribbean offshore financial services as havens for criminal activity. For us, this is a violation of our territorial integrity, our sovereignty and our economic rights. Saint Lucia accepts that it has an obligation to ensure that its financial services are not used by unscrupulous individuals and interests. However, Saint Lucia cannot, in all good conscience, surrender its sovereignty to a governance system imposed by a few.</div>
	<div class="p">In the face of these selfish actions by developed countries and the myopia of globalization, the role of the United Nations in bringing order into the system has become even more pressing. Saint Lucia therefore renews its call for a rebirth of the United Nations system, not only as an organization concerned with peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions, but also as an institution that is capable of effectively governing the global economic system in a way that ensures an equitable redistribution of the benefits of economic growth. We need a United Nations that will safeguard against global economic crises and promote the adoption of sustainable developmental policies.</div>
	<div class="p">In that context, and with the emerging spectre of a global economic recession, the upcoming United Nations Conference on Financing for Development becomes even more relevant, even more urgent. That Conference is of enormous importance to the small island developing States of the Caribbean, faced as we are by low aggregate gross domestic product, low domestic savings and investment capacity and undeveloped financial markets. The development agenda of the Caribbean region cannot proceed without the requisite financing, nor can it be sustained without an enabling international environment. We must all therefore commit ourselves to ensuring the success of the Conference.</div>
	<div class="p">Our renewed call for the rebirth of the United nations is further prompted by the observation that it is systematically being displaced as a source of guidance and as a fount of collective wisdom on global issues. We fear that if the United Nations continues to be marginalized in determining global development policies and strategies, then the concerns of developing countries will be excluded from the global agenda. A recent example of this is the decision not to include issues relating to the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in the preparatory meetings for the World Summit on Sustainable Development. We see this as undermining the spirit of the United Nations resolution that convened the United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, held in Barbados in 1994. Indeed, it was recognized then that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development had not paid sufficient attention to the special circumstances of small island developing States.</div>
	<div class="p">There are two other examples of United Nations inaction that leave us very concerned. Saint Lucia laments the adoption by the United Nations of a watered down instrument on small arms. In small island developing States like Saint Lucia, growing economic instability has given rise to increased levels of drug-related crime. In the Caribbean region, small arms are used in most of the violent crimes that are committed against our law-abiding citizens. The global trade in small arms must therefore be stemmed in the interest of peace and stability. A weak small arms document was therefore not what we required.</div>
	<div class="p">We remain deeply concerned that the Plan of Action for the first International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism did not result in the decolonization of the remaining 17, mostly small island, Non-Self-Governing Territories. Accordingly, we request, as a matter of priority, that the necessary resources and expertise be provided to implement the long-standing resolutions on decolonization and the critical analyses called for in the Plan of Action of the present International Decade.</div>
	<div class="p">I close by extending on behalf of the Government and the people of Saint Lucia, our warmest congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the hard-working staff of the United Nations on the recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize. We regard this award as an eloquent testimony to the sterling efforts of the Organization to build a peaceful world. At the same time, we see the award as a challenge to the United Nations to remain resolute in its commitment to the multilateral framework and not to allow itself to become incapacitated by inaction, especially where the defence of human security is concerned.</div>
	<div class="p">We all recognize that the events of 11 September have brought about a new era in world affairs and new challenges for all of us, in particular for the United Nations. In the times that lie ahead the United Nations system must do more that it has done before. It must resist the use of force in situations where wisdom is needed. It must work harder at becoming a source of hope to the hopeless and a reservoir of power to the powerless. It must redouble its efforts to restore the preservation of humanity as the highest of all ideals.</div>
	<div class="p">The horror of 11 September has shocked some of us into establishing a coalition against terrorism. It is time for the tragedy of underdevelopment to shock all of us into forging new coalitions for development. At this juncture, let us use this United Nations, energized by its Nobel award, to create these coalitions. Let us build a coalition in defence of the wretched of the earth -- to end their hunger, to terminate their poverty, to eradicate their diseases and to forever banish their wretchedness.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">My delegation is taking the floor to exercise, with due respect, its right of reply to some of the charges levelled against my country by the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia. I shall refrain from expressing subjective views, and only refer to statements made by Mr. Legwaila Joseph Legwaila, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, on each of the charges made by the Minister. I shall leave the rest to you, Sir, and to the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to the integrity of the Temporary Security Zone, at a press conference on 18 April 2001 the Special Representative said,</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"There are things that we can do as the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) and there are things that we cannot do. It depends on the willingness of the parties to negotiate with us and, finally, to agree to certain things. There are still problems, which we have to resolve insofar as the southern border of the temporary security zone is concerned ...</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"[The Ethiopians] told us before the 6 April [Military Coordination Commission] meeting that they had made a mistake when they gave us the redeployment points by leaving out this area of Irob. We corrected the line and then, when they completed their redeployment, we certified that they had redeployed. After a few days we discovered that they were present in the area at issue. That is the area that is six kilometres beyond the lines that we have drawn.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"We issued a statement, as you said -- a statement protesting the presence of the three companies in that part of Irob. I was invited with the Force Commander to go to Ethiopia to meet the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia, where we were told that Ethiopia had always been in that area, that Ethiopia had never left the area and that that area is part of ... [Ethiopian] territory ... Therefore, they have redeployed there in accordance with the line of 6 May 1998.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"We were told in certain terms that nothing -- and I underline nothing -- would move them out of that area. Therefore, as realistic people, we have decided that there is no use in trying to push the Ethiopians out of that area because they are not going to be pushed out of that area. Nobody wants to fight the Ethiopians out of that area, and therefore we have told the President [of Eritrea] that this is a typical candidate for the Border Commission. That is the only solution, because to mortgage the creation of the temporary security zone, and the progress of the peace process generally, to a resolution of the Irob issue would be tantamount to saying you do not want to create the temporary security zone, you do not want the peace process to go forward."</div>
	<div class="p">Who is appeasing whom? With respect to the increasing mobilization of Eritrean troops, the Special Representative was asked the following question during a press conference on 11 October:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Ethiopia said recently that Eritrean troops are in a state of high alert and that the troops have already been dispatched towards the border area and are preparing for another round of war, but Eritrea denies it. What is your comment?"</div>
	<div class="blockquote">The Special Representative replied:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Well, we have investigated that. Let me remind you that [whenever] one or the other party gives us whatever report, we investigate. And therefore we have been investigating the allegations that the Eritrean army is on high alert. And so far, we have found nothing to suggest that the Eritrean Army is on alert. Even yesterday we were running around to make sure that we were not caught by surprise."</div>
	<div class="p">On the other hand, Ethiopia is systematically violating the letter and spirit of the peace agreement and jeopardizing the peace. Let me give two examples. The peace agreement provides for a speedy exchange of prisoners of war and other detainees. During a press conference on 9 August, the Special Representative responded to a question by saying,</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"As you know, the parties on 12 December signed the Peace Agreement in Algiers. According to article 2 of that Agreement, they are required to release prisoners of war. As you know, soon after signing the Agreement, they started releasing prisoners of war.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Ethiopians are saying that because the Eritreans are not satisfactorily accounting for the whereabouts of the pilot Petros and 36 others who have not been accounted for, they have decided to stop releasing prisoners of war. The other side, in retaliation, is doing the same. But as we have always said, and as the International Committee of the Red Cross says, you cannot hold this process up. You cannot say that because you are not satisfied with something, you are not going to release prisoners of war. That is contrary to the Geneva Conventions."</div>
	<div class="p">On the issue of landmines, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General went on to say:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"We are pressuring everybody to give us landmine information. Eritrea has given us records for mines. Ethiopia has given us several hundred maps. We have never hidden the fact that we have been persuading Ethiopia to continue to cooperate with us in order that we can get all the records, all the maps, all the information they have so we know where these mines are, so people can live there safely".</div>
	<div class="blockquote">Eritrea rests its case.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have asked for the floor to exercise my right of reply to the statement made yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, during which he provided information that was not quite accurate, to say the least.</div>
	<div class="p">The statement of the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan was a blatant attempt to distort the evidence of its State-sponsored terrorism by reversing the roles of perpetrator and victim. Reversing these roles is nothing new. However, a large number of observers -- governmental and non-governmental organizations, both international and domestic -- have testified that it was the Azerbaijani authorities that either exterminated the non-Azeri population of Nakhichevan and Nagorny-Karabakh or created unbearable conditions for those people to live in. It was Azerbaijan that responded to the legitimate and parliamentary demands of the Armenian population of Nagorny-Karabakh with massacres and pogroms and, afterwards, with full-fledged war against the people of Nagorny-Karabakh.</div>
	<div class="p">It has been well documented that during that war, Azerbaijan was the first to use tanks, rockets, missiles, attack helicopters and combat aircraft. They were used not only against the Karabakh self-defence forces but also against the civilian population of Nagorny-Karabakh, as well as across the border on the Armenian side. When the Armenians of Nagorny-Karabakh responded by using mostly the same weapons, which they had captured from the Azerbaijani army, Azerbaijan decided to call their former victims "aggressors". What about the real aggressor who started it all and is now blaming everybody else but itself?</div>
	<div class="p">Truth is one and justice is one. Azerbaijan cannot lie to all the world all the time. Azerbaijan denies the people of Nagorny-Karabakh their inalienable right to self-determination, but meanwhile stresses -- here I am quoting from yesterday's statement by the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan -- that Azerbaijan</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"... stands for the speedy, peaceful settlement of conflict based on the norms and principles of ... the United Nations Charter [and] the Helsinki Final Act of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)".</div>
	<div class="p">At this stage, I wonder whether Azerbaijan stands for double standards in the application of the principles of the OSCE Helsinki Final Act, or whether the Minister is simply unaware that the principle of self-determination is one of those principles.</div>
	<div class="p">The memory of the Armenians and others -- young and old, children and women, civilians and soldiers -- killed in that war should prompt us to stop blaming each other and, instead, to look to the future and try to find an acceptable, full and lasting solution based on truth, justice and respect for human rights -- a call that was conveyed by my Foreign Minister in his statement yesterday.</div>
