	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Operation in Mozambique, <a href="../pdf/S-1994-803.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/803</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Members of the Council also have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1994-806.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/806</a>, containing the text of a letter dated 7 July 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Mozambique to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General of 7 July 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-803.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/803</a>) on the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). It commends the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the personnel of ONUMOZ for their efforts in support of the implementation of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique. They continue to have the full backing of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the significant progress made in the implementation of the General Peace Agreement, in particular in the electoral sphere, but remains concerned at continuing delays in the implementation of some major aspects of the Agreement. The Council is especially concerned at the delays which continue to occur in the demobilization of forces and in the formation of the new Mozambican Defence Force (FADM). In this context the Council reiterates its call in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-916(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 916 (1994)</a> of 5 May 1994 to the parties to comply fully with all the provisions of the Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;It is essential that the demobilization of all forces is completed by 15 August 1994, as agreed by the parties, and that the difficulties of forming, before the elections, the FADM at the strength agreed in the General Peace Agreement are addressed quickly and with flexibility.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Council is encouraged by the recent announcement of the Mozambican Government's decision to turn over the assets, including equipment and facilities, of the Mozambique Armed Forces (FAM) to the FADM by 15 August 1994 and reiterates the importance of the Government providing all necessary support to the establishment of the FADM.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;The Council underlines the importance to the peace process of the rehabilitation of areas with a large returning population, including through an effective mine-clearance programme. In this regard it urges that high priority be given to mine clearance activities and related training.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">&quot;The Council, in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-916(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 916 (1994)</a>, decided to renew the mandate of ONUMOZ for a final period until 15 November 1994 and welcomed the announcement by the President of the Republic of Mozambique that elections would take place on 27 and 28 October 1994. It reaffirms the importance it attaches to the elections taking place on these dates and stresses the need for additional decisive steps to that end. In this context, the Council stresses that there is no margin for further delay in demobilization and in the formation of the FADM. The Council expects the parties to continue to cooperate with ONUMOZ and with each other to ensure full and timely implementation of the Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">&quot;The Council reiterates the importance of the extension of civil administration throughout Mozambique, which is essential for the holding of free and fair elections. In this context, it reaffirms its call to all parties, especially RENAMO, to allow unimpeded access to the areas under their control to all political forces in the country, in order to ensure free political activity throughout Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">&quot;The Council expresses its intention to endorse the results of the elections provided the United Nations reports them as free and fair and reminds all the Mozambican parties of their obligation under the General Peace Agreement fully to respect the results.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">&quot;The Council will consider sending a mission, at an appropriate time, to Mozambique to discuss with the parties how best to ensure full and timely implementation of the General Peace Agreement and that the elections take place on the dates agreed and under the conditions set out in the Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">&quot;The Council will continue to monitor developments in Mozambique closely and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that it is kept informed on a regular basis.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-35.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/35</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
