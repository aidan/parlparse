	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa01">I should like at the outset, on behalf of the member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), to express our sincere condolences to the people and Government of India on the loss of property and life during the recent cyclone.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa02">On behalf of the 13 member States of the Caribbean Community -- Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago -- that are Members of the United Nations, of the sponsors listed in the document and of additional sponsors Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Pakistan, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America, I have the honour to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-51-L.14-Rev.1.pdf">A/51/L.14/Rev.1</a>, entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community", with the following oral revisions to operative paragraph 7.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa03">First, the word "<i>Requests</i>" should be replaced with "<i>Recommends</i>". Secondly, the following phrase should be deleted: "in conjunction with the Conference on Governance and Development". The new operative paragraph 7 now reads:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa04">"<i>Recommends </i>that the first general meeting between representatives of the Caribbean Community and its associated institutions and of the United Nations system be held in 1997, for the purpose of holding consultations on projects, measures and procedures to facilitate and strengthen cooperation between those organizations."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa05">The Charter of the United Nations places emphasis on the promotion of peace and security as well as on the economic, social and cultural development of Member States. Chapter VIII of the Charter also provides for cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. This arrangement -- cooperation between the United Nations and CARICOM -- rests on the principles, purposes and practices of those provisions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa06">In establishing CARICOM in 1973 and its predecessor, CARIFTA, in 1964, CARICOM States have demonstrated their intention to pursue multilateral cooperation in the advancement of their political, economic, social and cultural development. Since 1985, the Caribbean Community has invited the United Nations Secretary-General to be represented at their summits and has cooperated with the representatives of United Nations programmes and agencies at the regional level. CARICOM welcomed the participation of its Secretary-General in the second meeting between the United Nations and regional organizations convened by the Secretary-General in February 1996.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa07">CARICOM member States have themselves participated actively in regional and international forums, and, while emphasizing their unique needs and aspirations, have also proposed possible solutions to their problems.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa08">In 1991, the General Assembly granted observer status to CARICOM. Then, in 1994, CARICOM Heads of Government requested the Secretary-General of CARICOM to seek an even closer relationship with the United Nations, thereby affirming the growing partnership between the two organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa09">At their 1994 meeting, CARICOM Heads of Government decided to support the international community in the restoration of democracy in Haiti. CARICOM's participation in the multinational force and the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) was its first experience in United Nations peacekeeping operations. On several occasions, the Secretary-General of the United Nations expressed the international community's appreciation of the special role played by CARICOM in this mission. The establishment and continuation by CARICOM of a joint CARICOM-Haiti commission is evidence of the seriousness with which CARICOM accepts its partnership role.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa10">The General Assembly adopted resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-49-141">A/49/141</a> on cooperation between the United Nations and CARICOM on 20 December 1994. The report of the Secretary-General on this item, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-299.pdf">A/51/299</a>, outlines the activities of the United Nations system in the implementation of that resolution. The draft resolution currently before the Assembly, <a href="../pdf/A-51-L.14-Rev.1.pdf">A/51/L.14/Rev.1</a>, seeks to build on the partnership between this global Organization and its subregional counterpart. In its preambular part, the draft resolution draws attention to the importance of furthering CARICOM's role in the development of peace and security within the Caribbean region; the promotion of meetings between the representatives of the United Nations Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of CARICOM for consultations on policies, projects, measures and procedures that will facilitate and broaden cooperation and coordination between them; and the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community in the area of economic and social development, as well as of political and humanitarian affairs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa11">In its operative part, the draft resolution takes note of the very comprehensive report of the Secretary-General and of his efforts to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and CARICOM.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa12">In addition, the draft resolution draws attention to the priority areas of cooperation approved by the Standing Committee of Ministers Responsible for Foreign Affairs. These include follow-up to the global conferences; the advancement of the new global human order; the law of the sea; follow-up and implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States; the development of poverty reduction programmes; peacekeeping; diplomatic training; governance and development in the Caribbean; and the strengthening of the regional Secretariat information base.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa13">Furthermore, <a href="../pdf/A-51-L.14-Rev.1.pdf">A/51/L.14/Rev.1</a> invites the Secretary-General to continue taking the necessary measures for promoting and expanding cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community in order to increase the capacity of the two organizations to attain their objectives and requests the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Caribbean Community, or their representatives, to hold consultations with a view to signing an agreement on cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa14">The draft resolution calls upon the Secretary-General of the United Nations to consult with the Secretary-General of CARICOM to assist in furthering the development of peace and security in the region in the context of preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa15">We attach great importance and significance to the holding of the first general meeting between representatives of the Caribbean Community and its associated institutions and of the United Nations system in 1997, as recommended in paragraph 7.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa16">CARICOM member States also attach great importance to paragraph 8, which requests the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Caribbean Community, or their representatives, to encourage inter-agency, sectoral and focal point meetings on areas of priority.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa17">In conclusion, mindful of the current financial situation of the United Nations, CARICOM member States would propose a biennial reporting mechanism, without prejudice to efficient and cost-effective consultation and coordination between the two organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa18">I hope that the draft resolution will receive the support of all the members of the Assembly. From its inception, CARICOM has always upheld the principles of the Charter and this act of confirmation of its full partnership role would further enhance effective cooperation between the two organizations at a time of challenges and opportunities.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Turnquest" nation="Bahamas" language="">
	Mr. Turnquest (Bahamas)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa01">Allow me, first of all, to express the sympathy of my Government to the Government and people of India on the loss of life and damage to property due to the recent cyclone.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa02">In the post-cold-war era, the United Nations has an important role to play in coordinating and harmonizing the efforts of nations to achieve common objectives. Such aspirations include the attainment of international peace and security, cooperation in the economic, social and cultural fields and the fostering of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa03">In this connection, the United Nations must be seen as a mechanism not only by which the voices of all nations can be heard, irrespective of size or wealth, but also whereby constructive action is taken on behalf of all the world's peoples, particularly those who are most in need of assistance. As stated by the Foreign Minister of the Bahamas in her address to this session of the General Assembly:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg003-bk01-pa04">"The Bahamas is convinced that the United Nations remains the primary world body with the capacity and political will to bring together the disparate elements of the international community so as to face and deal with the challenges of the twenty-first century." <i>(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-first Session, Plenary Meetings, 24th meeting, p. 12)</i></div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa05">The Bahamas is pleased to note that the dynamic partnership between the United Nations and various regional organizations over the years has been instrumental in paving the way towards the attainment of our common goals. It is important that we take all necessary measures to foster and strengthen the environment of positive collaboration. Thus, the Bahamas welcomes the information contained in the first report of the Secretary- General on cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community. It clearly shows that, since the granting of observer status to CARICOM in 1991, there has been considerable collaboration between the two organizations; indeed, there was ongoing significant joint United Nations/CARICOM activity long before 1991. The report also reveals that there are many areas where cooperation can be strengthened even further.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa06">We welcome, in particular, the information regarding joint activities in the areas of disaster preparedness and prevention and international drug control, given the peculiar problems experienced by the region in these matters. Also, the signing of the memorandum of understanding for cooperation by CARICOM and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) can only augur well for the future given the high level of cooperation which has existed in the past between CARICOM countries and ECLAC, in particular the Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa07">We are also pleased to learn that, during the period under review, high-level officials participated in meetings and consultations of both organizations. This can only further the process of finding effective ways to work together. We note that, within the United Nations Secretariat, a new arrangement has been introduced to allow greater flexibility in cooperation and coordination and that it is expected that this new mechanism:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg003-bk01-pa08">"will facilitate more pragmatic and cost-effective cooperation between the two organizations". <i>(<a href="../pdf/A-51-299.pdf">A/51/299</a>, para. 12)</i></div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa09">The Bahamas is supportive of any step that is taken for the purpose of greater efficiency. However, we trust that, within this new arrangement, appropriate steps will be taken to ensure the continuation of collaboration at the highest levels of both organizations and that all activities will be carried out in a coordinated manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa10">The Bahamas is of the view that there could have been more information in the report on activities to be undertaken by some of the key areas of the Secretariat. For example, apart from information on small island developing States follow-up, there was no information on activities to be undertaken by the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development. Given the role that it will play in the follow-up to the recent United Nations conferences, all of which are of immense importance to CARICOM countries, it would have been useful to learn of that Department's plans to facilitate cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa11">Similarly, we would have welcomed information from the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis. The enhancement of national capacity with respect to data collection, research and analysis is of significant interest to CARICOM countries. Given the work done by that Department in these areas, it would have been useful to be apprised of their projections. Time will not permit me to comment in detail on other areas where information is missing. However, we hope that this lacuna arises merely from the data not having been put in the report, and not because these departments have no plans to engage in cooperative activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa12">The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations served in the Bahamas to heighten interest in the United Nations. Most likely the same is true of other CARICOM countries. Future joint public information activities should aim to maintain and build upon this increased awareness. Information on the work of both organizations should be publicized; such information should be of relevance to the region and should be widely disseminated in a timely manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa13">Given the importance of the development of human resources in the region, it would be useful in future reports to have information from entities such as United Nations Institute for Training and Research and the United Nations University. There is wide scope in these areas for activities such as training, fellowships, scientific exchanges and the preparation and distribution of publications. Similarly, in the light of the escalation of crime in the region, we would welcome information from the Division for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa14">The next logical step in this growing partnership between the two organizations would be the establishment of a formal agreement, as called for in the draft resolution which is before us (<a href="../pdf/A-51-L.14-Rev.1.pdf">A/51/L.14/Rev.1</a>). The final communiqué of the 1996 meeting of the CARICOM Standing Committee of Ministers Responsible for Foreign Affairs provides useful parameters within which such an agreement could be based.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa15">It is the hope of my delegation that, in the course of elaborating an agreement, due attention will be paid to developing cooperative activities in areas such as trafficking in small arms and the trans-shipment of hazardous waste through the region. Both of these activities are of grave concern to the region. Efforts should begin as soon as possible to draft an agreement as a framework for relations between CARICOM and the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa16">The Bahamas is of the view that collaborative action is on the right track, and we wish to commend both organizations for activities undertaken to date. Further success will depend on the willingness of both entities to continue to engage in constructive dialogue in a framework of mutual respect and harmony. We are confident that this will be the case.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa17">In closing, I wish to convey the full support of my delegation for the draft resolution before us.</div>

	Mr. Campbell (Ireland)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I express the sympathy of the States members of the European Union to the people and the Government of India in connection with the tragedy that has affected them as a result of the recent natural disaster.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa02">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The following associated countries align themselves with this statement: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Iceland and Norway have also aligned themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa03">The European Union welcomes the developments which have taken place over the last two years to strengthen and intensify the relationship between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). In this regard, the decision by CARICOM Foreign Ministers at their twenty-second meeting, held in Jamaica on 13 and 14 May 1996, to agree on new areas of activities for joint pursuit between CARICOM and the United Nations is of particular significance. Areas where enhanced cooperation will have special importance include issues related to the law of the sea, peacekeeping, cooperation in the development of poverty reduction programmes and in the follow-up and implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa04">The European Union is pleased to recall the constructive role played by CARICOM in the restoration of democracy in Haiti and the participation of the CARICOM contingent in the United Nations Mission in Haiti. As the Secretary-General points out in his report on the work of the Organization, this was the first time that the Community had participated in a United Nations peacekeeping operation. This type of action marks a major contribution to the development of peace and security within the Caribbean region and, as the Secretary-General rightly points out, serves to underline the vital role that members of CARICOM can play in furthering the United Nations causes of peace, development and democracy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa05">The report of the Secretary-General on cooperation between the United Nations and CARICOM (<a href="../pdf/A-51-299.pdf">A/51/299</a>) contains a detailed list of the range of cooperation activities between the two organizations. The European Union applauds these developments. They testify to the dynamism and energy which the members of CARICOM have brought to their relationship with the United Nations family and point to deeper and even more effective cooperation in the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa06">An example of regional cooperation involving the United Nations undertaken at the initiative of the European Union is the Plan of Action for Drug Control Coordination and Cooperation in the Caribbean, agreed in Barbados in May this year. This will provide for the adoption of measures aimed at better national coordination, legislation, law enforcement, demand reduction and maritime cooperation in the field of drug control. CARICOM will play an important role in facilitating the implementation of this Plan of Action.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa07">The European Union and its member States have a special relationship with the countries of the Caribbean. The ties of history are deep and well known. However, it is the new partnership between us that shows the strength of our long-term commitment to the region. We have developed, in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region, a strategy based on three main priorities: support for the process of economic transition; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development, the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats, including the fight against drugs; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa08">Under the fourth Lomé Convention, which provides $560 million dollars to the Caribbean region, the European Union is able to work closely with all the members of CARICOM individually and at the regional level to address the specific problems of CARICOM members, most of which are small island developing States. We recognize the economic and social difficulties which are unique to small island developing States. Their small domestic markets, geographical remoteness from neighbours and from extraregional markets and sources of supply, and the need for heavy investments in transport and communications aggravate the constraints to development which they must already tackle. The region as a whole is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters and their devastating impact on the economic growth of the countries of the Caribbean. Environmental degradation can also affect the basis of economic and social life in the countries of the Caribbean region, as natural resources are of essential importance to sectors such as tourism and agriculture.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa09">The European Union would therefore encourage island developing countries to pursue development strategies which will take into consideration long-term requirements for sustainable development. We reiterate our willingness to continue to provide financial and technical support for such measures.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa10">We warmly welcomed the adoption in May 1994 of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. The European Union is actively working to ensure that it is fully implemented and can make a lasting contribution to achieving sustained economic growth and facilitate sustainable economic development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa11">The European Union is already sharing its own experience of regional cooperation and integration with the countries of the Caribbean and reaffirms its commitment to continue to provide financial and technical assistance in support of CARICOM's own efforts to tackle the challenges which are special to small island economies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa12">We welcome the creation of the Association of Caribbean States as yet a further effort at integration, and the Forum of Caribbean States of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. We believe the experience gained in the process of regional economic integration by CARICOM is a major asset in the wider integration process on which the entire Caribbean basin can build.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa13">In this context, we believe that further efforts should be made to promote regional economic integration and cooperation, which can lead to economies of scale across a range of economic activities from protection of coast lines to environmental protection, trade promotion and market access, tourism development and the expansion of inter-island feeder services. This overall strategy should enable the achievement of international competitiveness and the gradual integration of the Caribbean into the world economy. At the same time, the negative effects of transition from poverty should be addressed alongside the economic reform process. In this respect, human development and capacity-building are fundamental to sustainable development in the region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa14">The co-sponsorship by members of the European Union of the draft resolution, which we hope will be adopted by consensus, is testimony to the value and importance that we continue to attach to the role of CARICOM and to its ever closer relationship with the United Nations.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Mpay" nation="Cameroon" language="French">
	Mr. Mpay (Cameroon)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa01">On behalf of the African Group, I wish, like the speakers before me, to express our deep condolences to the Government and people of India for the loss of human life in the cyclone that recently struck the country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa02">I am speaking in reference to agenda item 25, entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community". I speak on behalf of the African Group.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa03">Since its inception on 4 July 1973, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which currently has 14 member States, has made considerable progress towards subregional integration. The objectives of the Community, as defined in the Treaty of Chaguaramas -- <i>inter alia,</i> economic cooperation through the Caribbean Common Market; coordinated foreign policies; and creating joint services in such essential sectors as health, education, culture, communications and industrial relations -- have been methodically pursued through the establishment of appropriate Community structures by its member States. We therefore welcome the fact that, from the erstwhile Caribbean Free Trade Association to the current organization, the Caribbean Community has made great strides in the quest for the ways and means to strengthen subregional integration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Thirteen years after its inception, we can confirm that the Community is doing well and has a positive record. Indeed, thanks to its efforts in such varied areas as agriculture, health, education, upholding human rights and promoting democracy, the Community has spared no effort to maintain the link between the States of the subregion and developments around the world. It has particularly sensitized the countries of the subregion to the stakes involved in their collective future and their common destiny.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa05">In this respect, beyond the efforts already taken in the areas cited above, we must point out other initiatives to promote economic, social and cultural development in the countries of the subregion are under way, strengthening the dynamic towards subregional integration. Thus, the measures taken by the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community at their seventh meeting, held in Bridgetown from 3 to 7 July, this year, move in this direction. Indeed, the Heads of Government undertook to promote, <i>inter alia, </i>the modernization and diversification of the agricultural sectors of their respective countries in order to make them more competitive and hence income-generating, and to consolidate the food self-sufficiency of their peoples. Moreover, the implementation of recommendations promoting, <i>inter alia, </i>freedom of movement and the establishment in the subregion of artists, musicians, athletes, journalist and university graduates, together with even more dynamic measures, can promote a general subregional culture of integration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa06">In the area of coordinating foreign policy, the presence of CARICOM in Haiti within the content of United Nations peacekeeping efforts demonstrates unequivocally the pacific and international nature of the organization and its involvement in the search for peaceful solutions to the problems facing Belize, Guatemala, Guyana, Venezuela, Saint Kitts and Nevis and other countries. The Community's ongoing efforts to draft a civil society charter and a regional programme for witness protection demonstrate that the Community is working to promote and uphold human rights in the countries of the subregion.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa07">I have listed only some of the many achievements of the CARICOM, which are, furthermore, directly in keeping with the objectives of the United Nations. The granting to the Caribbean Community of observer status in the General Assembly on 16 October 1991 and the signing in January 1995 of a memorandum of understanding between CARICOM and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which is designed to promote cooperation between the CARICOM and the United Nations in several key areas, were therefore necessary.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa08">The CARICOM countries are small island developing States whose development needs are considerable. We therefore welcome the productive cooperation established between CARICOM and the United Nations system. Document <a href="../pdf/A-51-299.pdf">A/51/299</a> gives an exhaustive overview of the areas of cooperation under way between the two organizations. We encourage this cooperation and sincerely hope that it will expand to encompass joint activities between CARICOM and the United Nations, as defined at the twenty-second meeting of the Standing Committee of Ministers Responsible for Foreign Affairs, held on 13 and 14 May 1996 at Kingston, and at the seventh meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM, held from 3 to 7 July in Barbados.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa09">Key areas of cooperation include follow-up to global conferences; progress towards a new international human order; issues relating to the law of the sea; follow-up and implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States; cooperation in the development of poverty reduction programmes; peacekeeping; diplomatic training; governance and development in the Caribbean; and the strengthening of the Regional Secretariat Information Base.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa10">It is only by diversifying this cooperation that the United Nations and CARICOM, which have common goals, will succeed in reducing poverty, creating jobs, developing human resources, revitalizing trade and the economy, promoting health and education in the region -- in brief, ensuring sustainable development for the small island States in the region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa11">All of Africa therefore encourages the United Nations and the CARICOM to begin that journey. That is why we support the draft resolution in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-L.14-Rev.1.pdf">A/51/L.14/Rev.1</a> and hope that it will be approved by consensus.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Allow me to express our condolences to the delegation of India on the sad human and material losses suffered following the cyclone in that country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa02">We are drawn to this podium today by the bonds of brotherhood and solidarity that have historically linked the people of Cuba with the peoples of the Caribbean. This traditional brotherhood between our peoples has gone beyond our regional relations and is reflected in all forums of the United Nations, where our status as small and vulnerable islands has strongly defined and mobilized our efforts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The establishment of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in July 1973 was not only a historic event for the Caribbean countries but also a model for all those who, with legitimate pride, foresaw and, witnessed the definitive incorporation of the Caribbean States into the United Nations system in October 1991, when the Caribbean Community obtained observer status in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa04">Since that time, the 14 States of the Caribbean Community have benefited from cooperation with the United Nations, its programmes and specialized agencies. But they have also made a significant contribution, both individually and collectively, to the work, purposes and principles of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa05">In this regard, we would like to express our concern at the fact that the proposed medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001 does not grant the necessary importance to the question of small islands. The States of the Caribbean Community have been standard-bearers in the cause of peace and development. The peace processes in Haiti, Central America and Africa have benefited from the presence and contributions of the Caribbean States. Important international conferences on cooperation for development, on sustainable development and on trade and development, as well as the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, have enjoyed the invaluable participation and the praise of the Caribbean States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Important multilateral negotiations have been held under the presidency of Caribbean countries, and, under their auspices, international bodies and forums have been established that will play a significant role in the promotion and progressive development of international law.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Cuba is honoured to participate in this debate on cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community. The report submitted by the Secretary-General, pursuant to <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-49-141">General Assembly resolution 49/141</a>, is encouraging as to current and future cooperation between the Caribbean Community and the Organization. Furthermore, the report accurately illustrates the international efforts undertaken by small States, which, rising above their tremendous resource limitations and the adverse climate conditions inherent in their geography, have succeeded in establishing and developing multilateral consultation and cooperation mechanisms. In so doing, they have preserved their longstanding political, social and cultural commonality, as well as their unmistakable identity as members of the Caribbean and Latin American community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa08">In December of this year, Cuba will host a ministerial meeting of the Association of Caribbean States. Just as the General Assembly has welcomed CARICOM, the people and the Government of the Republic of Cuba open the doors of our small country to the brotherly States of the Caribbean. We reiterate our support for strengthening international cooperation with CARICOM.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa09">For many reasons -- reasons as old and sacred as our common roots -- Cuba will always support efforts to promote the progress of the brotherly peoples of the Caribbean, in the framework of the United Nations as well as in our region. We reiterate today that we will contribute to the best of our ability to the process of the fruitful integration of our economies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa10">We are certain, and indeed have seen proof, that this readiness is and always will be mutual among the Caribbean States, with which we share not only the vast sea that bathes our shores but also the unbreakable resolve to fight for a future of peace, justice and equality among all States.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa01">We wish at the outset to convey our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his report on cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) (<a href="../pdf/A-51-299.pdf">A/51/299</a>).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa02">This report details the various activities undertaken between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community to promote cooperation in areas of critical importance. It also notes the various efforts by the member States of CARICOM to realize the ideals and purposes of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Of special significance are the activities undertaken by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in the Caribbean, whose main areas of activity are education on health and family life, better parental training, and vocational training.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as the main United Nations body charged with promoting the development of island States, has important development links to CARICOM. UNCTAD's key activities include assistance in automating customs, the establishment of a commercial centre, and specialized training programmes in trade, maritime transport and the environment. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) also carries out important projects together with the member States of CARICOM.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa05">We appeal to the various organizations and agencies of the United Nations system to take the measures necessary to promote and expand cooperation and coordination with the Caribbean Community in the areas identified by these countries. We hope that the efforts deployed will soon result in a cooperation agreement between the two organizations, which, we are certain, will accord with the mandates, competence and composition of both organizations and which will adapt to each specific situation, as provided for by the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa06">The Caribbean enjoys priority in Mexico's foreign policy and has a well-defined place in its trade policy. Joined by a sea that grants us the privilege of being part of the Caribbean region, we have points of convergence which my country has sought to utilize and expand.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa07">Mexico has stepped up its activities in the region based on renewed support for traditional cooperation activities with the Caribbean and identification of new and more fruitful mechanisms to that effect. We recently reopened our embassy in Trinidad and Tobago -- an example of our commitment to expand our diplomatic presence -- and we are committed to launching initiatives aimed at building stable and lasting relations between Mexico and CARICOM.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk04-pa01">Permit me first to express, on behalf of my people and the Government of Colombia, our solidarity and brotherhood with the people of India and, in particular, its delegation, represented at this Assembly, with regard to the natural disaster that recently occurred on its shores, at great human and material cost.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk04-pa02">My country, Colombia, a country on the Caribbean, shares with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member States their hopes for development and their ongoing quest for a better life for their peoples. We are pleased to note that this Community, following the various modalities for cooperation that the United Nations and its specialized agencies have been developing since their early years with various regional organizations, has found effective methods for consultation, information exchange and cooperation with the United Nations system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk04-pa03">The Caribbean Community, established on 4 July 1973, obtained observer status by a General Assembly resolution of 16 October 1991. Since then -- according to the report submitted by the Secretary-General pursuant to <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-49-141">resolution 49/141</a> of 20 December 1994 and contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-299.pdf">A/51/299</a> of 20 August 1996 -- the Community, in cooperation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies, has undertaken a number of activities in various fields that have contributed to the economic and social development of its member States. The institutionalization of mechanisms of cooperation has also helped the Community and its member States to participate more actively in the work of the United Nations and to contribute to the achievement of its objectives.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk04-pa04">There is no doubt that the importance attached by the Governments of the CARICOM member States to the question of cooperation with the United Nations -- as demonstrated by its inclusion on the agenda of meetings of its ministers and Heads of Government and by the Community's participation in regular meetings between the United Nations and regional organizations and arrangements to coordinate cooperation activities -- will continue to provide strong momentum that will certainly benefit both organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk04-pa05">CARICOM has been an important factor in the integration process of the wider Caribbean basin that has opened up avenues to new and broader forms of cooperation in the region. In this regard, we recall that, on 24 July 1991, on the birthday of the Liberator, Simón Bolívar, Colombia, the 14 CARICOM States, the Central American countries, Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Venezuela established the Association of Caribbean States, which is open to the participation of the territories of the region as associate members and seeks to strengthen cooperation and the development of cultural, economic, political, scientific, social and technological relations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk04-pa06">In view of all this, my delegation cannot but support the development of fruitful cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa01">Allow me first to convey my country's condolences to the people and Government of India for the terrible losses they have suffered in the cyclone which has just struck their country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The following is the text which Ambassador Fowler was to deliver this afternoon.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa03">(<i>spoke in French</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa04">"I am pleased to address the General Assembly today as a sponsor of the draft resolution before us, entitled Cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community'.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa05">"We have read the report of the Secretary-General on cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) with particular attention. It summarizes an impressive variety of activities that the United Nations is carrying out in the region in close cooperation with CARICOM, ranging from disaster relief to a major Caribbean-wide conference on child rights. Canada is pleased to note that a large number of concrete actions respond directly to the basic needs of the people of the region or aim to prepare the required infrastructure and trained personnel to tackle these problems.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa06">"Canada is also gratified to note the large number of pragmatic activities aimed at promoting the economic development of the region. We note actions at the grass roots to encourage the small- and medium-size enterprise sector and market access for smallholder rural producers. At the same time, consultations to foster appropriate macroeconomic policies and improve productivity, competitiveness and international market access contribute at the national level to the development, expansion and adaptation of Caribbean economies within the world economy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa07">(<i>spoke in English</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa08">"Throughout the report of the Secretary-General, mention is made of efforts to involve women in shaping the future of the region. That is based on strong and laudable Caribbean traditions and Canada applauds the work of the United Nations in building on this strong historical Caribbean foundation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa09">"Canada considers CARICOM's cooperation with the United Nations in Haiti as an example of the potential for the further development of peace and security within the Caribbean region and we are pleased that the draft resolution before us today focuses on that aspect of CARICOM's regional role. The cooperation between the United Nations and CARICOM reflects a trend which the Secretary-General has encouraged: cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. That cooperation means that United Nations actions result from close consultation with Member States and better reflect the priorities of local Governments and their peoples. At the same time, we urge CARICOM member States and the United Nations agencies involved to ensure that every effort is made to avoid duplication and any dissipation of scarce resources.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa10">"Many United Nations and CARICOM priorities are also priorities for the bilateral relationship between Canada and CARICOM. In areas such as economic cooperation, commercial relations and the campaign against illicit drug traffic, Canada has been pleased to join its efforts with those of partners equally dedicated to the task of improving the lives of the people of the Caribbean. These have positive effects beyond the region, including in Canada, and we believe it important to support them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa11">"Canada and the Commonwealth Caribbean share a long tradition of cooperation and friendship in many areas. Our contemporary relationship, as was made clear during the recent consultations between Canada and CARICOM in Ottawa on 7 and 8 November, has evolved to address the new political, social and economic challenges in the region. CARICOM is a valuable interlocutor for Canada on important regional issues such as free trade and narcotics. We have supported CARICOM countries in their efforts to pursue important economic reforms in an increasingly complex and competitive international environment. Canada and CARICOM have also worked together here at the United Nations, with positive results in areas such as fisheries, the proposed international criminal court and the development of small island States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa12">"For these reasons, Canada encourages the United Nations and CARICOM to pursue what is evidently a productive relationship, and we therefore support the current draft resolution."</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Let me first, on behalf of the members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, extend to the Government and people of India sincere condolences on the tragic loss of life and damage to property occasioned by the recent cyclone.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa02">On behalf of the members of the Latin American and Caribbean Group, I should like to thank the Secretary-General for the report (<a href="../pdf/A-51-299.pdf">A/51/299</a>) on cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). This report has been submitted in accordance with <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-49-141">resolution 49/141</a>, adopted in December 1994, which formalized the cooperation between the United Nations and CARICOM and which requested the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the resolution at this, the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa03">The report outlines a wide range of activities undertaken between the United Nations and CARICOM pursuant to the resolution, and details programmes undertaken by different arms of the United Nations system within the Caribbean region. We wish to commend the secretariats of both bodies for the efforts that have been made in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa04">The member States of the Latin American and Caribbean Group welcome this cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community, which is an important subregional grouping within the Latin America and Caribbean region. The cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community has been and will be conducted in accordance with their respective mandates, competence and composition, and should be tailored to each specific situation, in conformity with the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa05">The consultations between the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and of CARICOM and the participation of officials of both organizations in important meetings of the two bodies have without doubt assisted in strengthening the links between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa06">As the report rightly recognizes, the increasing complexity of international relations has led the United Nations to place a premium on cooperation and coordination at the regional level. In this context, it emphasized that the United Nations attaches utmost importance to building ever-closer ties with CARICOM, and took note of its member States' contribution to the United Nations Mission in Haiti. The member States of Latin America and the Caribbean are encouraged by this commitment and are agreed that close collaboration of this nature will be of real benefit to the organizations, and, more importantly, to the peoples of the Caribbean region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa07">The report notes the subjects that the Caribbean Community's Standing Committee of Ministers Responsible for Foreign Affairs has proposed to be areas of joint pursuit between the United Nations and CARICOM. These include: follow-up to global conferences such as the Rio summit and the Barbados Conference on the sustainable development of small island developing States; the proposal for a new global human order; issues related to the law of the sea; follow-up and implementation of the Programme of Action for small island developing States; cooperation in the development of poverty- reduction programmes; peace-keeping; diplomatic training; governance and development in the Caribbean, and strengthening of the Regional Secretariat Information Base. These all are important items which we believe should be given careful attention.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The extensive report of initiatives undertaken within the region by various funds and programmes of the United Nations system, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), is also encouraging. Of special note are the programmes intended to assist in improving the quality of life of children and in addressing problems related to disaster relief, development, women's issues and trade.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa09">The Latin American and Caribbean Group takes note also of the attention paid to the relationship between CARICOM and the specialized agencies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa10">Taken in their totality, all these initiatives can contribute positively to improving the ability of the United Nations and CARICOM to work together for the benefit of the peoples of the Caribbean and in furthering the international goals of peace, security, and development, to which the United Nations is committed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa11">I therefore welcome this report on behalf of the member States of the Latin American and Caribbean Group and call for the adoption by consensus of the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-L.14-Rev.1.pdf">A/51/L.14/Rev.1</a>, as orally revised, entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community".</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The United States is pleased to cosponsor this draft resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). We support our friends and neighbours, the member States of CARICOM, in their call for a closer working relationship with the United Nations. The United Nations is not only a forum for individual Member States, but also a resource for regional organizations and arrangements. CARICOM is a regional leader, encompassing 14 States and millions of people. It showed leadership recently in its support for the United Nations-authorized peacekeeping missions in Haiti that restored peace to the region and supported democracy in the hemisphere.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Since the formation of CARICOM in 1973, the organization has worked to improve and integrate the economies and political structures of the Caribbean -- bettering the lives of its people. The United States has supported CARICOM's efforts, and will continue to do so. CARICOM's efforts to increase trade and investment and to promote sustainable development among its members are laudable.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa04">CARICOM is also showing leadership through its efforts to work closely with the United Nations in the areas of development, environmental protection, drug control, and the promotion of the welfare of children. Coordination of efforts among nations makes programmes more effective and helps guard against duplication of effort. We support this draft resolution and CARICOM's continued goal of bringing the region's Governments together, helping these dynamic nations to secure a better future for their citizens.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Allow me first to join other delegations in expressing our condolences to the delegation of India on the loss of so many lives in the recent cyclone.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa02">The German delegation of course fully associates itself with the statement of the Permanent Representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union. Germany, however, would like to take this opportunity to underline the importance we attach to the discussion and solution of the problems, the interests and the positions of small island States in general and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in particular in the forums of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa03">Germany is ready to cooperate even more closely with all Caribbean States on a wide range of topics, from enhancing private investment in this region to environmental protection. The protection of the environment is an important part of German foreign policy. In this respect, we are convinced that solutions and aid to the specific problems of small countries, such as the CARICOM member States, can only be based on cooperation on equal terms and on a process of mutual respect and understanding. We will never allow ready-made solutions to be imposed on small and fragile countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa04">Over the past year the CARICOM countries, we note with regret, have often been affected by environmental catastrophes, such as the recent hurricane, with devastating effects. Germany was able to provide assistance to the victims of these situations. Since June of this year alone we have granted DM 6.5 million in bilateral emergency aid to the Caribbean Community. Important as this emergency assistance is, however, it is obvious that we need more long-lasting solutions. Therefore, Germany wants to assist the Caribbean Community further in establishing an effective early warning system to help create protective mechanisms which are vital to save lives and to prevent the worst consequences in the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa05">The German Foreign Office has financed a study on early warning systems for the Caribbean region. Climate change has become a vital issue for the CARICOM countries, as for other island countries. The German Government is aware of the fact that the industrialized nations bear a great responsibility in this regard. Therefore, together with the small island States, including CARICOM, we intend to adopt a mandatory protocol on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Since the second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in July this year, the chances to adopt such a protocol have significantly improved.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa06">In our view, the year 1997 will have a decisive influence on the development of environmental protection worldwide. Germany will make clear that it sees its responsibility when we meet next year in the Commission on Sustainable Development and prepare for the special session of the General Assembly to take stock of how we have implemented the mandate that was formulated five years ago in Rio de Janeiro by our Heads of State and Government. The special session of the General Assembly will have to find as concrete as possible an answer, to the question of what we have achieved since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) on our common path to sustainable, economically efficient, socially balanced and ecologically sound development. In the context of the special session, we would like to propose a special discussion dedicated to the progress achieved by implementing the Declaration of Barbados.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa07">The 1994 Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States held in Barbados, in which my Government actively participated, not only generated international awareness for the situation of this specific group of developing States, but also brought us the Declaration of Barbados, a programme of action which we endorse.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa08">Germany can build on its own experience when it comes to implementing the Rio de Janeiro Conventions on Climate Change and on Biological Diversity, as well as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa. During the relevant negotiations, Germany has consistently played a particularly active role and made sure that the just interests of other partners in the South, especially in the Caribbean Community, namely their economic and social development, will be taken into account in the context of the common task of the protection of our global environment.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa09">My country looks forward to continued cooperation with all CARICOM countries, together with our partners and within the framework of the European Union. That is why we are sponsoring, together with the other European Union countries, the draft resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa01">Allow me to begin by extending to the people and Government of India Argentina's solidarity with them following the natural disaster they suffered recently.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Argentina is taking the floor to show its support for strengthening cooperation between the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the United Nations. We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/A-51-299.pdf">A/51/299</a>). In our opinion, his recommendations are appropriate insofar as they lay down a suitable frame of reference for strengthening that cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa03">This initiative reflects the important role CARICOM countries play in the Organization and their commitment to strengthening international peace and security and promoting sustainable human development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The consolidation of democracy in the region, which has always found inspiration in CARICOM, has been significantly strengthened by developments in Haiti. In this context, we appreciate the work of the United Nations and its Member States, and in particular the contribution made by CARICOM to the United Nations presence in Haiti.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa05">We also wish to point to the dynamism and presence of the Caribbean countries in efforts to promote the agreements reached at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held at Rio de Janeiro.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa06">We share the concern of the countries of the region over the effects of climate change on our environment. If progress is not made in these negotiations, the island States of the Caribbean and of other regions will be particularly affected. This is why we believe that we need to finalize a satisfactory agreement within the context of the Framework Convention on Climate Change in order to avert major damage.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa07">In this context, it is also particularly important to implement the commitments made at the Barbados Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. We hope that due emphasis is placed on the particular situation of these countries within the framework of the review of the Rio de Janeiro agreements.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa08">It is in a spirit of solidarity and with concern that we note that the region is periodically affected by various kinds of natural disasters. Action by the international community in this connection -- and particularly by the United Nations -- to reduce the damage caused by hurricanes deserves particular mention. We nevertheless believe that once a crisis situation is resolved, international attention declines and proves insufficient to meet the needs of rebuilding damaged infrastructures. This is something we should change.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa09">Argentina participates in reconstruction efforts through its deployment of "White Helmets" to various countries of the region. More specifically, Argentina, through the Horizontal Cooperation Fund, has channelled resources to the Caribbean to cooperate in the sustainable human development of that region. More than 30 cooperation projects are currently under way in areas as diverse as agricultural training, poverty eradication, State reform and privatization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa10">Regional cooperation, in conjunction with cooperation between the various regional organizations and the United Nations, is one of the mechanisms we have available to eliminate the universal problems that affect international peace and security and the viable development of future generations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, I wish to say a few words about how we in Argentina feel about the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). These countries are a great credit to the United Nations, as they are to the Organization of American States. Since joining the agencies of the hemisphere they have brought new approaches and a flexible and positive spirit to efforts to solve regional problems. The work of CARICOM's representatives in the Commission on Human Rights, to mention but one example, is a clear example of what I am saying.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa12">However, there is more. The countries of CARICOM have shown and continue to show that good governance and pluralistic democracy are perfectly compatible with efforts towards sustainable development, and that it does not matter if one has small sectoral economies when those who administer them are sensitive to the needs of their peoples.</div>

	Mr. Ferrarin (Italy)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I wish to fully associate myself with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Ireland, Ambassador John Campbell, on behalf of the European Union. His words represent the common position to which my country contributed, along with all the other partners.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa02">Let me take this opportunity to add some observations that Italy wishes to underline. Cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is a particularly successful case in the wider framework of cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. Italy was one of the sponsors of the draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-51-L.14-Rev.1.pdf">A/51/L.14/Rev.1</a>) because of the positive results of this cooperation and because of the emphasis it has given to economic development and the affirmation of democracy in the CARICOM area.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa03">The economic and social development of all CARICOM countries must be one of the main priorities of United Nations initiatives, together with the enhancement of their capacity to be active participants in and contributors to United Nations activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa04">The entry into force of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the establishment of the International Seabed Authority in Kingston are two examples of the development of international law and of the valorizing of economic resources that directly interest these island States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa05">The characteristics of the CARICOM region and the importance of its development are among the prime reasons for Italy's active promotion of European Union cooperation and partnership with the small island developing States, and for its contribution to the follow-up of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States two years ago. Italy believes that the international community should take stock of the invaluable experience that the small island States have accrued in many sectors.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa06">In the context of the Lomé Convention, during the meeting of the Council of Ministers of the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States in Mauritius, Italy made every effort to prevent major changes to the list of less developed countries and to draw greater attention to the difficulties, in the event of natural catastrophes, of countries removed from the list.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa07">During its term as President of the European Union, Italy supported the desire of the Caribbean States to start a political dialogue. This proposal was made at the Kingston session, which allowed for an exchange of views that went well beyond a mere survey of regional issues. Italy hopes that a structural framework will be given to this dialogue in the future. In the long process involved in the renewal of the Convention, Italy will be supportive of the needs of the Caribbean community, as it has been in the past.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa08">Italy is studying a series of development initiatives in the field of environmental protection and new and renewable sources of energy. These initiatives will be implemented through the United Nations system in conformity with the principles of sustainable human development agreed on in Copenhagen.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa09">Today's draft resolution takes note of the special role played by the States Members of the Caribbean Community in the restoration of democracy in Haiti. The United Nations has played an essential role in returning democracy to this country, and we believe that it must continue to be present in order to strengthen in the short term and the long term the country's stability, the security of its citizens, respect for human rights and economic development. Only stability and security can give the necessary confidence to investors. We will therefore continue to do our part in the proper United Nations bodies, including the General Assembly, to promote and support the United Nations presence in Haiti.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg013-bk01-pa10">Italy, which is tied to many countries of CARICOM by long-standing bonds of friendship and culture, will continue to follow with great attention this area of United Nations action.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa01"> In accordance with <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-46-8">General Assembly resolution 46/8</a> of 16 October 1991, I now call on the Observer for the Caribbean Community.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Blake" nation="[Caribbean Community CARICOM]" language="">
	Mr. Blake ([Caribbean Community CARICOM])
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa01">I wish to express the heartfelt sympathy of the Caribbean Community to the Government and people of India for the loss of life and property incurred as a result of the recent cyclone. We well understand their loss.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa02">I am honoured to represent the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) as members of this organ join in support of the draft resolution entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa03">The Caribbean Community, as an integration movement of small States, the overwhelming majority of which are small island developing States, places very great reliance on multilateral systems and rules. The United Nations has succeeded over its 50 years in building systems that simultaneously recognize the sovereign equality of States and differences in the natural endowments and economic capacity of States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa04">CARICOM was established by the Treaty of Chaguaramas on 4 July l973 with the fundamental objectives of, first, promoting and facilitating economic development, thereby improving well-being and reducing poverty and unemployment; secondly, strengthening and coordinating the interface of the small States of the Caribbean with the international community; and, third, promoting, through cooperation, social and cultural development and the preservation of these. The processes continue with increasing intensity and urgency to cope with the pace of global development and change.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa05">Within CARICOM, priority has been given to deepening the economic integration process through the creation of a single market and economy before the year 2000. The single market will maintain the openness of the region to international trade and investment. The process has therefore focused on completion of the internal free market for goods; freeing the market for the movement of capital and investment and for the provision of services, including labour services, beginning with skilled labour; and facilitating and encouraging factor movements through measures such as the harmonization and transferability of social security benefits and the avoidance of double taxation. It has also focused on implementing a competitive common external tariff for imports from the rest of the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa06">The second objective is to organize the institutional and human capacity for more effective participation and engagement in hemispheric and global developments. In this regard, there is a Prime Ministerial subcommittee of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM which has the responsibility of prioritizing and coordinating the region's position on external economic issues and negotiating on behalf of the region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa07">The third objective is to increase the involvement of civil society. In this regard, a Caribbean Community charter of civil society, having been the subject of broad-based consultation, is now in the final stages of approval. The Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community have also set in train plans for a regional, broad-based conference on social and economic development, which will be held in 1997. This conference will build on the results of the various United Nations global conferences and on initiatives in the region over the past five years.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa08">The Caribbean Community has continued to give high priority to relations with neighbours in the Caribbean. In this regard, it admitted Suriname to full membership to the Community in mid-1995; Suriname began to function as a member of the Common Market on 1 January 1996. The Caribbean Community spearheaded the operationalization of the Association of Caribbean States in 1995 and continued its support for the strengthening of democratic institutions, the maintenance of peace and the building of the economic and social infrastructure in Haiti. The Caribbean Community seeks the cooperation of the international community in keeping the Caribbean Sea, which unites all the countries of the Caribbean basin, safe and free from the threats of hazardous materials and waste.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa09">The granting to the Caribbean Community of observer status to the United Nations General Assembly on 16 October 1991 was an important boost not only to regional integration, but to cooperation between the Community and the various United Nations organizations and bodies. It stimulated, for example, the adoption of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-49-141">resolution 49/141</a>, entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community" on 20 December 1994 and the signing of a memorandum of understanding in January 1995 between the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the Caribbean Community. It has encouraged, even in the face of rapidly declining resources to the region, a number of critical cooperation initiatives with various United Nations agencies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa10">I would, by way of example and given the elaborate report of the Secretary-General, refer to, first, the initiative of the ECLAC and CARICOM to monitor and promote action to implement the Programme of Action adopted by the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States; secondly, the initiative of the United Nations Children's Fund and CARICOM in relation to health and family life education; thirdly, the initiative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to set up a trust fund to facilitate enterprise, education and development in the Caribbean; and, fourth, the support of UNDP for the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency and its response to the frequent natural disasters that plague the region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa11">The draft resolution before the General Assembly today will further strengthen the resolve of various agencies of the United Nations system to work cooperatively with the Caribbean Community as it seeks to promote integration and sustainable development and to strengthen its productive and institutional capacity to participate effectively in the global economy. It will also encourage the United Nations itself to focus directly on the special vulnerabilities and the security of the small States, individually and in the Caribbean region as a whole. In this regard, the Caribbean Community anticipates that the review of the follow-up of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other global conferences, which will be undertaken in 1997; will focus specifically on the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States and provide priorities for future cooperative action.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk02-pa12">The Caribbean Community supports the draft resolution, which reinforces the tradition and history of cooperation between the Caribbean Community and the United Nations. We therefore thank members for this opportunity, as an observer organization, to address the General Assembly.</div>
