	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa02">It is a great pleasure for me to welcome all present once again to the General Assembly Hall. As announced in the <i>Journal</i>, today's meeting is devoted to the consideration of further steps towards the realization of a comprehensive programme of reform aimed at making the Organization better equipped for a pragmatic and more effective accomplishment of its mission in today's world and in the next millennium.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa03">The issue of United Nations reform has been at the centre of deliberations in the General Assembly from the very beginning of its current session. Discussions held during the general debate, at the open-ended consultations of the whole, in the Main Committees, and at the informal informals clearly demonstrated that Member States attach great importance to this matter. For many reasons, I can state that the reform process, initiated by the Secretary-General back in March 1997, and its outcome during the main part of the fifty-second session highlight the determination of the United Nations and its constituents to review a wide range of issues related to the Organization and its activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa04">In this regard, let me briefly recall that two consensus resolutions under agenda item 157, entitled "United Nations reform: measures and proposals", were adopted on 12 November and 19 December last year. I do not wish to comment extensively on the provisions of those resolutions, since I believe that the months of negotiations which led to their adoption allow a lot of the delegates present here today not only to make a precise quotation of the relevant paragraphs, but also to give a full negotiating history of the formulations agreed upon.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa05">In those resolutions, the Secretary-General was requested to submit a number of reports and additional explanations related to the different aspects of realizing the reform proposals. In particular, under <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-12.pdf">resolution 52/12</a> B some of the reports and explanations were to be submitted before the end of March this year, namely on a new system of core resources, on a revolving credit fund, on the utilization of a development account, on the Millennium Assembly, et cetera.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa06">I wish to extend my gratitude to the Secretary-General and his team for the timely preparation of the requested documents, as well as for his willingness to present them personally in the General Assembly. His dedication and tireless efforts aimed at reforming the Organization deserve our continued appreciation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa07">The new set of documents, which has already been given the name "Track 3 reform" in the corridors of the United Nations, places a number of questions before the General Assembly on, first of all, how to proceed further with their consideration. I hope that the question of how to deal with the reports and notes presented by the Secretary-General will be one of the focal points of today's discussion, and I would like to encourage views and proposals in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa08">The fifty-second session has already been marked as the Reform Assembly. Today's meeting is a vivid testament to the remarks which I made at the adoption of the second resolution on United Nations reform, to the effect that that resolution actually represented not a concluding stage but a first step on the road to transformations in the Organization. We are now facing new challenges: to ensure the continuity of the reform process in the General Assembly and to give it a new impetus at the intergovernmental level which will permit us to consider changes of a more fundamental nature.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa09">In this context, I cannot help but mention the current financial situation of the United Nations. Lack of substantial improvements in this area may seriously undermine the credibility of the reform process, thus sending a strong negative message to the outside world and the general public about the ability of the United Nations to adapt itself to the changing international environment.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa10">I hope that there is a clear understanding in this Hall that the contributions to the United Nations should be paid by the Member States in full, on time and without conditions. In this regard I would like to stress that issues of United Nations reform depend not only on the political will of the membership, but also on sufficient funding. For United Nations reform to succeed, all Member States must assume their treaty obligations and ensure full payment of their assessments. United Nations reform is well underway. I take this opportunity to repeat my earnest appeal to all Member States, including in particular the largest contributor, to swiftly pay their outstanding as well as current contributions. It will be the most definite indication of genuine support for the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa11">There is no one in the Assembly who could seriously question the need to continue the reform of the United Nations. Indeed, in recent months the reform process has become not only an integral part of the daily life of the Organization but also of ourselves as individuals. By engaging in it, we strive to make the more effective United Nations contribute better to the people in their efforts to build a safer, healthier and more just and prosperous world. The United Nations must continue to undergo changes, but it is my strong belief that only changes which enjoy the universal support of Member States and serve collective needs can be successful. And let me also remind you that the only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa12">I now invite the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to address the General Assembly.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="The Secretary-General" nation="" language="">
	The Secretary-General
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01"> It gives me great pleasure to come before you again to discuss the reform and renewal of the United Nations. Much has happened since we last gathered, in world affairs and in the ways of this house, that makes me especially eager to push ahead with this process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">Last July, I proposed to you that we begin a quiet revolution to transform the United Nations: its leadership, its structures and its performance. In September, I challenged the General Assembly to become the Reform Assembly -- to join forces and seize the opportunity of a new global era to revitalize the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa03">We are well on our way. Last fall, you initiated the process of open-ended informal consultations within the plenary, an innovation that expedited our deliberations. In your resolutions 52/12 A and B, you endorsed a range of landmark actions and set a course for future progress that promises similarly historic gains. I am very grateful to the members of the Assembly for these important first steps. I am here today to facilitate the conclusion of the first phase of this work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa04">I would like to review with you the current state of the reform process and where I believe we are headed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa05">Allow me to begin by reporting that the measures that fall within the prerogative of the Secretary-General have been largely implemented. As you know, the work of the Secretariat in its main thematic areas is now guided by Executive Committees in order to ensure communication, coordination and a common purpose. The Senior Management Group has also proven its worth quickly as the first systematic forum where the leaders of all United Nations departments, programmes and funds come together to develop policies and ensure managerial clarity. The Group meets weekly, with colleagues in Geneva, Nairobi, Rome and Vienna participating by teleconference. Its work will soon benefit from that of the Strategic Planning Unit, our first in-house "think tank", whose terms of reference I have just approved. And our work in two major areas -- disarmament and humanitarian assistance -- has been given new focus and impetus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa06">If reform begins at the top, with these and other steps affecting leadership at Headquarters, reform must prove itself on the ground, in bringing positive change into people's daily lives.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa07">The United Nations Development Group has come into being, promising greater coordination and integration of our operational activities for development. We are establishing "UN Houses", common premises to promote teamwork and efficiency, and in a year or two we should have as many as 50 "UN Houses".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa08">And we have made significant progress in devising Development Assistance Frameworks so that United Nations programmes and funds come together not only physically but in their work as well, in support of a common vision and objective that host Governments themselves determine.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa09">Reform has brought reductions in budget and in staff, and the consolidation of some Headquarters departments and activities. But reform is far more than the sum of these or any other cuts. Procedures and rules are being simplified. Administrative costs are being reduced. Common services are being extended, and an electronic United Nations has become a reality. Above all else, a fundamental review of human resources management is under way, with the objective of strengthening the staff of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa10">The net result is as it should be: a more productive and effective Organization, together with a renewed emphasis on economic, social and development activities, the very heart of our mission.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa11">Looking beyond achievements within the Secretariat, I am pleased that the various recommendations I made for reforms in the intergovernmental machinery are under consideration by appropriate bodies. I very much hope that we will soon see progress in this realm as well.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa12">I am also pleased to report that the Secretariat has now issued, in response to the request of the General Assembly, seven notes on a number of the recommendations contained in my reform plan. Allow me to review them briefly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa13">We are proposing a Millennium Assembly, not merely to commemorate the year 2000 but to articulate a vision for the United Nations in the new century and to propose system-wide institutional adaptations that will enable us to act on that vision. We are also suggesting that a non-governmental forum be held in conjunction with the Millennium Assembly, in recognition of civil society's rightful place in our work -- and in recognition of the United Nations own need to move closer to the people it exists to serve.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa14">We are proposing time limits, or "sunset provisions", for initiatives involving new organizational structures or major commitments of funds. Upon the expiration of a duration specified by Member States, mandates would continue only if they were explicitly renewed. This practice would help us end the built-in bias towards institutional inertia that has afflicted the Organization for far too long.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa15">We have elaborated on our earlier proposal for the development dividend, which will channel savings generated by administrative efficiencies towards investments that benefit developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa16">We are recommending ways to ensure more predictable and secure core resources for development. This is essential if United Nations funds and programmes are to increase efficiency, avert discontinuities and maintain a relationship of trust and reliability that is a key part of being an effective development partner. It will also lead to better planning and management oversight by the boards. The practical measures we are recommending should be seen as first steps towards more effective funding modalities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa17">Finally, you will soon receive further elaborations of my proposal that the United Nations shift to results-based budgeting, including departmental mock-ups illustrating how such a system would function. Perhaps more than any other measure, this will give the Organization the flexibility and agility it needs in an era of rapid change, while at the same time enhancing both transparency and the Secretariat's accountability to Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa18">It is my hope that you will adopt some of these proposals quickly in the plenary and permit us to proceed with implementation. Where more extensive technical analysis may be required, I hope that the Assembly will forward those recommendations to the appropriate committees so that they may report back to the plenary in a timely manner that will permit adoption of these recommendations before the end of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa19">The world has just seen, in the recent agreement between the United Nations and Iraq concerning weapons inspections, just how much a united and determined international community can achieve through the United Nations. What we have done in Iraq through reason, diplomacy and political will, we can do all across the United Nations agenda.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa20">The world has also just witnessed, in recent months of financial turmoil in Asia, yet another example of accelerating interdependence among nations, economic as well as political. This makes the presence of an effective United Nations, as a unique tool for concerted action, more imperative than ever. In this connection, I was particularly impressed by the dialogue that was initiated recently at Headquarters between the Bretton Woods institutions and the Economic and Social Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa21">And last but not least, the past year has seen the United Nations staff rise to the occasion: embracing change, coming forth with valuable ideas of their own, proving again and again that they are indeed the Organization's most important asset.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa22">So let us take advantage of this moment of promise, when all of these "stars" -- the Member States, a supportive global public, a rededicated staff -- seem to be in alignment.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa23">And let me reiterate a fundamental point. We are transforming our United Nations not as an end in itself, but as a means to better carry out our mission of peace, development and human rights. We do this not to please any particular constituency, but because we must be able to better meet the needs of the world's people and the Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa24">This process is not a luxury; it is not a gimmick; and it is not an imposition. Reform is our survival, our future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa25">Now it is my distinct pleasure to introduce to you the first Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Louise Fréchette.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa26">The establishment of the office of Deputy Secretary-General is the most direct and perhaps most consequential product of the reforms to date. Already, Madame Fréchette is immersed in one of her main priorities: directing the implementation and monitoring of the reforms instituted thus far. She will also be responsible for revising and updating our reform agenda as the process evolves. I know you join me in welcoming her to the United Nations and wishing her well in this and the many other challenging tasks she has now assumed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa27">Let us push ahead. Let us continue realizing the great promise of this Reform Assembly.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa01">On behalf of the General Assembly I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his important, comprehensive statement concerning the implementation of the United Nations reform process, as well as for the introduction of Ms. Louise Fréchette, to whom we wish all the best in her very important endeavour and assignments -- not only in implementing the United Nations reforms but also in any other assignment the Secretary-General may give to her.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa02">Before giving the floor to the first speaker, let me briefly share my views on how we will proceed with the consideration of the reports that have just been presented by the Secretary-General. This question is very important if our deliberations are to be successful. It is indispensable to ensure further thorough and detailed consideration of the reform proposals.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa03">While being flexible regarding a particular procedure, on Thursday 23 April I had a meeting with the Chairmen of the regional groups and expressed my preference on how to handle the matter. During today's debate I would like to encourage Member States to dwell not only on substantive issues but also on the way to organize future proceedings. I think this may facilitate our work on the reform proposals and be helpful in our efforts to reach consensus at this juncture.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated country Cyprus, as well as the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries members of the European Economic Area, Iceland and Liechtenstein, align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The European Union welcomes the opportunity to discuss the follow-up to the Secretary-General's report, "Renewing the United Nations: a programme for reform" [<a href="../pdf/A-51-950.pdf">A/51/950</a>], and the subsequent General Assembly resolutions 52/12 A and B. We would like to take the opportunity to reaffirm our strong support for the Secretary-General's initiatives to strengthen the United Nations through reforms aimed at making the Organization more effective and efficient.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The European Union is grateful to the Secretary-General for the seven papers he has presented to the General Assembly in response to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-12.pdf">resolution 52/12</a> B. At this stage I shall make some brief initial remarks on each of the papers.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa04">The European Union welcomes the paper on the Millennium Assembly [<a href="../pdf/A-52-850.pdf">A/52/850</a>], which we believe outlines a sensible process for the preparation of this important event. We consider that the new millennium should be celebrated in a special and meaningful manner by the United Nations, and that the proposal of the Secretary-General to produce a report for heads of State and Government derived from a series of internal and external events on the future role of the United Nations should help to achieve a focused and forward-looking outcome. Among these events, the follow-up meetings to the Beijing Conference on Women and to the Copenhagen Social Summit will figure prominently. We believe that the General Assembly should endorse the paper forthwith.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa05">The European Union also believes that the Secretary-General's paper on the Development Account [<a href="../pdf/A-52-848.pdf">A/52/848</a>] is useful, and we support the main thrust of its contents. We welcome the intention to use funds in the Account for programmes focusing on global, interregional and regional issues, with an emphasis on helping developing countries to implement commitments arising from United Nations conferences. We are pleased that the paper emphasizes that the Development Account should not be used for activities carried out under other programmes, and in this context we note the need to be particularly careful to avoid duplication of the work of the United Nations funds and programmes. However, we would welcome some further clarification on how reporting to Member States on Development Account programmes will be carried out and how programming, monitoring and evaluation will be handled.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The European Union would also appreciate further details of the practical mechanism for agreeing on the redeployment of the funds to the Development Account, assuming, as the paper does, that there would be savings on a regular basis. Subject to these clarifications, we believe that the proposal should be adopted by the General Assembly in plenary meeting during its fifty-second session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa07">The European Union also very much welcomes the paper dealing with sunset provisions [<a href="../pdf/A-52-851.pdf">A/52/851</a>]. We would therefore fully endorse the proposal that any new initiative should be subjected to time limits and that such limits be stipulated in the relevant resolutions and decisions establishing a new mandate. The current paper also highlights the deficiencies in the way in which existing mandates are reviewed. The European Union has on previous occasions noted with some concern that while procedures do exist for determining the continuing validity of legislative decisions, most mandated programmes and activities have not, in practice, been subjected to specific time limits. Moreover, those evaluation studies which have been concluded have not addressed the question of the continuing validity of the programmes themselves. Corrective action should be taken to address this problem. We believe that the General Assembly should endorse the principle in this paper and should seek the advice of the Committee for Programme and Coordination and other relevant bodies as to how better to achieve its implementation with regard to existing mandates.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa08">With regard to the document entitled "The impact of the implementation of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures" [<a href="../pdf/A-52-852.pdf">A/52/852</a>], the European Union welcomes the clarification provided by the Secretary-General in this report.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa09">The European Union welcomes the Secretary-General's note on core resources for development [<a href="../pdf/A-52-847.pdf">A/52/847</a>]. The European Union provides a substantial proportion of the funding for United Nations development programmes and activities and recognizes the importance of sound and predictable funding. The Secretary-General's note puts forward a number of ideas on how to improve the predictability of core resources. The European Union is ready to engage constructively in further discussion of this important issue. However, as the paper notes, as part of the follow-up to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-50-227.pdf">General Assembly resolution 50/227</a>, consideration of various funding options is currently under way in the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes. The European Union supports the suggestion of the Secretary-General that our further consideration of this report should be handled in such a way as to ensure that the results of the work in the Executive Boards of the funds and programmes are fully reflected in the eventual conclusions on this item. We would like to see progress achieved on this by no later than the end of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa10">The European Union believes that the Secretary-General's note on the reconstitution of the Trusteeship Council [<a href="../pdf/A-52-849.pdf">A/52/849</a>] proposes a sensible process for further consideration of this idea by the Task Force on environmental and human settlement issues. We agree that consideration by the General Assembly should be postponed until the Task Force has completed its work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa11">The European Union is conscious of the difficult situation in which the Secretary-General finds himself as a result of the precarious financial situation and the consequent perpetual cash-flow problems. In this context, the European Union will carefully consider the proposals outlined in the Secretary-General's report on the establishment of a revolving credit fund [<a href="../pdf/A-52-822.pdf">A/52/822</a>] capitalized through, <i>inter alia</i>, voluntary contributions by Member States. However, our view remains that the fund cannot be seen as a means of allowing, or indeed encouraging, Member States to avoid their financial obligations to the Organization as laid down in the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa12">The European Union believes that the plenary of the General Assembly is the appropriate forum for discussion and action on all the papers before us, as it was for the Secretary-General's original report last year. All the issues they cover, particularly those related to development, deserve full and timely consideration. We have indicated above the timescale for some of the items. However, we believe a certain urgency attaches to consideration of the papers on the Millennium Assembly and sunset provisions, while at this stage the papers on the Trusteeship Council and core resources could be noted pending the results of other relevant processes. The European Union is prepared to enter into discussion immediately on these points.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa05">We now need to take a decision on the manner in which to proceed with regard to the discussion of the outstanding reform proposals. The Joint Coordinating Committee of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 agrees with the proposal to allocate the reports on economic and financial issues to the competent Committees -- in this case, the Second and Fifth Committees -- which will report back to the plenary on the results of their work once it is appropriately concluded.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa06">With regard to the proposal for the consideration of longer-term changes, given the fact that the plenary setting is not suitable for the in-depth discussion and negotiation of proposals of such importance as these, the Joint Coordinating Committee of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 is of the view that the study of these issues should be entrusted to a working group or groups of the General Assembly. Such a measure would provide the General Assembly with a commonly-used mechanism to carry out an orderly discussion that would save time, while ensuring that delegations have the information they need and the required possibility of open and transparent negotiation. The Joint Coordinating Committee would like to emphasize the need for the proposals contained in the section of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-12.pdf">resolution 52/12</a> B on longer-term changes to be discussed within an open-ended format that guarantees transparency by allowing the full participation of each and every delegation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Allow me to reiterate the willingness of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 to participate actively and constructively in the analysis of the Secretary-General's proposals for reform. That is our intention.</div>

	Mr. Shen Guofang (China)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Late last year, the General Assembly, by its relevant resolutions, invited the Secretary-General to further clarify issues addressed in his report, entitled "Renewing the United Nations: A programme for reform", in order to facilitate a better review by the Member States of the relevant recommendations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The Chinese delegation has read with great interest the seven reports and notes prepared by the Secretary-General on such questions as the Millennium Assembly. We would like to extend our special thanks to Secretary-General Annan for his oral introduction of the reports today before the plenary. We would like to express our deep appreciation for his consistent efforts to push forward the reform of the United Nations since he assumed office last year.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Since the report was received only a couple of days ago, today I would like, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, to share a few preliminary observations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The Chinese delegation has stated on many previous occasions that the Secretary-General's recommendations in his report on reform involve questions that should be discussed and decided upon by Member States and thus warrant in-depth and thorough study. Now that the Secretary-General has once again laid out his views for the reference of Member States on such questions as the Millennium Assembly, it is incumbent on Member States to make a timely study of these questions through the proper mechanisms. We believe that questions in the economic and financial fields should be referred respectively to the Second and Fifth Committees of the General Assembly. As for the remaining questions, since they cover a wide range of issues, an open-ended working group of the General Assembly could be set up to ensure in-depth and thorough discussion and concrete results.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The Chinese delegation is in favour of the Secretary-General's proposal to convene a Millennium Summit in the year 2000. We believe that, at the dawn of the new century, the United Nations should have an opportunity to look back at its 55 years of existence and to define its future tasks and direction of development so that it will be able to meet the challenges of the next century with greater vitality. To ensure the success of the Summit and the achievement of concrete results, the General Assembly should establish as soon as possible an open-ended preparatory committee to discuss and determine the various arrangements as well as the agenda and documents for the summit. We hope that the Secretary-General will produce a report as soon as possible after listening to the views of the great majority of Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Regarding a new concept of trusteeship, we look forward to the further proposals by the Task Force. However, it should be emphasized that changing the functions of the Trusteeship Council, which would involve a number of political and legal issues, will require a thorough review by all Member States at the appropriate time.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa07">The serious financial crisis that has engulfed the United Nations in recent years must be addressed with greater urgency in the reform process. As everyone knows, the crisis has resulted solely from the arrears which major contributors have refused to settle. Therefore, the only fundamental way to ease the crisis is for the major contributors to pay their overdue contributions as soon as possible and without condition. The establishment of a revolving credit fund might help to ease the crisis temporarily, but we fear that, instead of solving the crisis once and for all, the fund would only impose an additional financial burden on those Member States that pay their contributions on time. Proposals to revise the current Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations also deserve an in-depth study by the relevant committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa08">To promote development is one of the important tasks of the United Nations. We welcome the establishment of a Development Account by the Secretary-General in the current biennial budget, which is to be used specifically for the development of developing countries. We hope that the Account will genuinely play its expected role of further strengthening the work of the United Nations in the field of development, and at the same time without prejudicing or hindering the implementation by the Secretariat of other undertakings under General Assembly mandate. United Nations operational activities, with their universal, neutral and multilateral nature, have played an important and irreplaceable role in international cooperation on development. However, in the past few years, the lack of funds, especially core resources, has set back and undermined operational activities throughout the United Nations system. We are of the view that core resources should continue to come mainly from the contributions of developed countries, especially those which have the capacity to undertake such responsibilities but have shunned them. What is vitally needed here is political will. If countries can reach common ground on this issue, then the core resources for development will enjoy predictable, sustained and guaranteed growth.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa09">I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Ms. Fréchette upon her formal assumption of office as Deputy Secretary-General. Ms. Fréchette, an outstanding woman with rich experience, is now the first Deputy Secretary-General of the Organization. We are confident that she will greatly assist the Secretary-General in the next few years to make the United Nations work even more efficiently.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Richardson" nation="United States" language="">
	Mr. Richardson (United States)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Thank you, Mr. President, for your thoughtful statement and your continuing leadership of the General Assembly. We wish also to thank the Secretary-General for his reform initiatives and his energy, and for summarizing the main features of what already has been accomplished. We heed the Secretary-General's call for continued work towards the remaining Track-2 United Nations reform recommendations, and pledge our cooperation to him and to other Member States alike on behalf of a more effective and more efficient Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Last autumn's consensus on the Secretary-General's ideas, contained in "Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform", also known as Track 2, was a critical and useful first step in turning ideas into action. Now, as we study more ideas and consider more action, the Secretary-General's famous maxim comes to mind: that reform is a process, and not a single event.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Since the Assembly last addressed this agenda item, much useful work has ensued, and consultations have revealed support and enthusiasm for early results and ongoing implementation. The press has taken note of what many term the most historic reform exercise in United Nations history. As many would attest, the creation of the post of Deputy Secretary-General has been executed with skill and grace, and the Organization is enriched by the appointment of Ms. Louise Fréchette. My delegation is confident of her ability to serve the Secretary-General well on behalf of reform. As we continue, my delegation looks forward to Secretariat reporting on its Track-2 implementation plan, its goals, its action offices, and its timetables.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The reform momentum is evident beyond Headquarters as well. Current sessions of the United Nations regional commissions display steadfastness in improving their activities and performance, and we note increased budget-mindedness and utility in other entities of the United Nations system. Also, the Assembly will soon consider the Secretary-General's report on his implementation of Secretariat and Assembly reforms agreed last year by the General Assembly's Open-Ended High-Level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa05">In the United States delegation's view, our task today is to continue the momentum for the Secretary-General's reform package.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa06">The setting of the General Assembly has served this purpose well in affording consistently high-level participation, keeping negotiations from degenerating into overly detailed stalemates, and sustaining the political momentum necessary for continued cooperation among reform's many participants. Last autumn, informal negotiations of the whole made possible the participation of all interested colleagues and spokesmen, and two major consensus texts emerged within a month of each other. Your formula of Friends of the President, Sir, met with success, and we believe it could continue to serve us well now as we consider the remaining reform recommendations in front of us.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa07">What is it that we hope to see accomplished in this next round of meetings? We must address the Secretary-General's views as elaborated in recent reports, and promote adoption of ideas which would enhance the United Nations. If I may, I would like to outline my delegation's specific views in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa08">With regard, first, to a Development Account funded from administrative savings, the United States delegation has advocated this from the beginning. We want savings to go to new development programmes, but post-2002 support for those programmes, if merited, should come from additional savings or voluntary contributions, and should not automatically expect regular-budget sourcing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa09">On trusteeship, the United States feels strongly that the United Nations has accomplished its trusteeship objectives and that there is sufficient United Nations machinery to address environmental concerns, and it therefore opposes refitting the Trusteeship Council to such ends.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa10">With respect to programme sunsetting, we strongly support the Secretary-General's view that any new intergovernmental mandates would be subject to sunset provisions unless otherwise determined, and we would like to see existing programmes so reviewed as well. This is consistent with establishing priorities and an effective managerial culture throughout the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa11">Turning to a revolving credit fund for regular budget, this idea we believe is not practicable, principally because no one has stated that they would contribute. We would regret it if this issue were to distract Member States from an otherwise productive Track-2 negotiation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa12">On core resources for development, we appreciate the need to continuing calling for voluntary contributions, and the United States continues to lead in this regard. We believe that effective results in United Nations operations best attract voluntary funding, and that civil society could prove a vital new resource; but again, United States Government budgeting does not permit multi-year pledging.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa13">On millennium plans, we welcome United Nations activity leveraging the symbolic value of the millennium, in part to sustain the reform momentum. The Millennium Assembly appears to be a cost-effective approach within existing resources. Preliminary ideas for a special commission on the United Nations system need more review.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa14">The Secretary-General's delegation of financial and human resources authority to line managers is within his prerogative. We support such front-line accountability and trust that this will discourage micro-management by Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa15">We look forward to subsequent consideration of the Secretary-General's recommendations for results-based budgeting among other items slated for later Assembly consideration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa16">Again, Mr. President, we appreciate your leadership in promoting yet another useful consensus outcome on United Nations reform recommendations, and we pledge our cooperation with you and all other colleagues for open and candid consultations as we move onward in the process of reform.</div>

	Mr. Pal (India)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa01">My delegation fully supports the statement just made on behalf of the Joint Coordinating Committee of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77. We thank the Secretary-General for briefing the General Assembly on the implementation of the reforms which the Assembly has approved thus far and for introducing his report and notes today, and we congratulate him on his continuing efforts to reform the United Nations to equip it better to meet current challenges and to make a felt impact on the lives of the citizens of the States represented here.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa02">We welcome the Deputy Secretary-General, whom the Secretary-General today formally introduced to the Assembly. The developing countries have high expectations of her and of her office.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa03">We support all initiatives that will enhance the role of the United Nations in promoting development, whether through a development account or by ensuring predictable and assured core funding for United Nations programmes and funds. As we have said throughout these discussions, this is the touchstone by which we will judge the success of the reform process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Reforming structures may modernize them, but even a rejuvenated system will succeed only if the resources needed to fully implement its mandates are made available. We are therefore ready to engage, in a spirit of cooperation and partnership, in further discussions in the Second Committee on the report on core resources for development, and in the Fifth Committee on the Revolving Credit Fund, on the utilization of the Development Account and on the impact of implementation of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures. But these discussions will not alter the reality that even this reformed United Nations will remain in financial crisis if assessed contributions are not paid in full, on time and without conditions. We have just been reminded that reform is a process, not an event. But unless arrears are paid promptly and future contributions not held back, reform will become -- as sections of the media have noted -- a process of non-events.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa05">A brief word about the Development Account. We still have no assurance that mandated programmes of vital interest to developing countries can be fully executed within an arbitrary ceiling or that the Development Account can be maintained in the years to come. On the other hand, we welcome the objectives of the Development Account, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the promotion of South-South cooperation. We look forward to further discussions to ensure that the objectives for the utilization of this Account can be promoted without in any way affecting the conduct of other programmes or mandates of the United Nations, especially those which are of primary interest to developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa06">On a possible new concept of trusteeship, we await the report of the high-level Task Force set up by the Secretary-General under the Chairmanship of the Executive Director of United Nations Environment Programme.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa07">Any change in the Charter bodies of United Nations that has a profound bearing on the structure of this Organization must be discussed in an open-ended and transparent manner to allow all delegations and countries to effectively participate in and enrich those discussions. This caveat also applies to other long-term changes proposed in the reports of the Secretary-General. For example, the success of the Millennium Assembly can be ensured only through proper preparations, including through a preparatory committee or an open-ended working group, to decide through inter-governmental negotiations its agenda and outcome. Furthermore, the documentation for discussions will need to be prepared well in advance if the Assembly is to have more than a symbolic impact.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa08">We have noted that the question of constituting a special commission at the ministerial level to consider changes in the constitutions and charters of the specialized agencies has been deferred to the Millennium Assembly. We have some doubts about the need for such a commission. We also believe that it is important to ensure that the Millennium Forum being proposed is truly representative in scope, with full and effective participation of non-governmental organizations from developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, we want to believe that the changes that we have approved and will be considering in the future will lead to real gains in the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations, and that together they will strengthen the hand of the Secretary-General in promoting the objectives of the United Nations.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Takasu" nation="Japan" language="">
	Mr. Takasu (Japan)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Let me first of all express on behalf of my delegation, my appreciation to the Secretary-General for presenting the report before us in response to the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly last year. Japan is gratified by the momentum for reform that has been generated in the current session of the General Assembly, which has been dubbed the "reform General Assembly", and hopes that, with a firm political will and a forward-looking spirit, we will be able to achieve overall and balanced reform, encompassing the Security Council, finance and development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The proposals put forward by the Secretary-General today are an important milestone towards part of such a comprehensive reform. Indeed, since his proposals are integral elements of Track 2, it is essential that we not lose sight of the whole picture and give careful consideration to each of them in that light. We should then move on as soon as possible to the implementation of the proposals on which Member States can agree.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa03">As for the procedure we should follow, my delegation is of the view that, as a first step, all the proposals should be initially considered at the policy level in plenary. The exact format could be approached flexibly. However, to the extent necessary, as an extra step, we have no objection to submitting some of the proposals to the relevant committees, in order to get their technical findings. However, they should then be returned for consideration and decision by the plenary in a timely manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa04">With regard to the timing of such a procedure, in principle those proposals should be acted upon by the General Assembly during the current session. There are some proposals that should be implemented as quickly as possible. For instance, I wish to refer to the question of the Development Account. In the 1998-99 budget, an initial amount has been budgeted and appropriated and it is necessary to make a concrete decision on the specific use of the fund. Moreover, if we are to reflect the Development Account in the next budgetary process, which starts this August, it will also be necessary to reach agreement as early as possible on the mechanism for implementing the Development Account. Therefore, to the extent that some of them have to be discussed in a Main Committee -- such as the Second or the Fifth Committee -- these considerations should be settled in May so that the plenary can come back to resume its consideration on all those proposals and make a decision on their implementation in June.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa05">I would now like to present the basic position of my delegation on the various proposals. First of all, my delegation attaches particular importance to the speedy implementation of the Development Account, as I said earlier. This Account was formally established by the General Assembly at the end of 1997, on the basis of a concept which Japan advocated: to reinvest savings for use in the field of development. It is necessary that we come to an early agreement, first, on the projects for which the funds will be used during the current biennium and, secondly, on the modalities for the Development Account in future bienniums. As regards this biennium, $13 million has been appropriated for this Account, but not a single dollar has yet been spent from it. In order to have the funds available for projects that will benefit the development of developing countries, it is necessary to reach agreement on the projects for which it is to be used. We therefore request a clarification as to when the current concrete proposal is to be presented by the Secretariat.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa06">In our view, the basic purpose of the Development Account is to support activities to assist global and/or regional development efforts that would ordinarily be funded from the regular budget but that cannot be fully realized due to insufficient funds. We would like to suggest some examples that could be considered to be funded from the Development Account during the current biennium. First, in the present global economic climate -- which is fundamentally different from what it was earlier this decade -- it is important for the United Nations to devise a new development strategy, drawing upon the relevant experiences within and outside United Nations forums. I believe it would be useful for the Secretariat to tap the resources available in the Development Account and gather the views of a range of experts and relevant organizations to contribute to the efforts of Member States to explore better this issue.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa07">Secondly, in promoting South-South cooperation there is a need to enhance information and communication regarding the availability of technologies so that interested parties can be better informed about where to find the technologies they need. The Secretariat, while avoiding duplication of work done elsewhere, could use the funds in the Development Account to conduct a study on the establishment of a data bank of technologies accessible to interested parties so as to match the demand and supply of South-South cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa08">Thirdly, projects to assist in enhancing the capabilities of developing countries to conduct economic research and analyses should also receive high priority in the use of the Development Account.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa09">I would now like to comment on the modalities for implementation in the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa10">In implementing the proposals to be funded by the Development Account my delegation does not have a problem with the proposal of having the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs serve as Programme Manager. However, as for the procedure for approving projects once submitted, I wonder if it might be useful to request the Secretary-General to propose projects as a part of the proposed programme budget, as he stated, and to present them also to the Economic and Social Council for its consideration. Recommendations by the Economic and Social Council would be submitted to the General Assembly for final approval in the context of adopting the programme budget. This might be meaningful in terms of enhancing the role of the Economic and Social Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa11">As regards the income side of the Development Account, it is Japan's position that a certain level of savings should be appropriated for the Development Account at the time of adopting the programme budget. We thus differ from the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in this regard. The Secretary-General's report is not conclusive as to the timing of specifying the savings and appropriating them for the Development Account in the budgetary process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa12">I would like to urge the General Assembly to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the mechanism and modalities for implementing this Account in order to prepare an outline for the next budget in August.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa13">Next, Japan basically supports the proposal that the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, in the year 2000, be designated the Millennium Assembly and that a high-level segment be devoted to consideration of the United Nations in the twenty-first century. I would emphasize, however, that in order to ensure that such an endeavour is truly meaningful, it will be necessary to prepare for it adequately and to decide well in advance on the designation of the Assembly. We hope the designation of the Millennium Assembly will invigorate the reform efforts that are under way and promote reform in the political, economic, social and administrative areas in a balanced manner, with the results reflected in the report for this session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa14">As for the proposal to reorganize the Trusteeship Council and have it take up global problems such as those relating to the environment and common areas -- the seas, atmosphere and outer space -- let me state that Japan sincerely appreciates the suggestion that the United Nations intensify its efforts regarding these matters. We note with interest a Secretary-General's establishment of a Task Force chaired by the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa15">However, the vital and growing importance of the global environment should not be confused with the fact that the Trusteeship Council has fulfilled its historic mandate. We believe that the Trusteeship Council, once it has successfully achieved its objective, should be abolished and that the global environment and common areas should be addressed by the other appropriate United Nations bodies. The question of considering them in the context of a new concept of trusteeship should be taken up more appropriately and realistically in the relevant bodies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa16">Turning now to the Secretary-General's proposal for sunset provisions to provide specific time limits for mandates, let me say that Japan basically supports this concept as a contribution to defining clearly the objectives and goals of activities. The international community is changing, and international organizations must review their activities regularly in order to address and meet these new needs. The continuation of activities that have lost their relevance and urgency in the changing international situation tend to occupy precious time and resources of the United Nations, leaving little for the emerging and truly worthwhile ones. We would welcome the broad application of the sunset provision as one of the useful tools for United Nations programming. In the future, new mandates, when prepared by Member States and the Secretary-General, should be more clearly defined in terms of objectives and duration at the time of adopting a draft resolution in the General Assembly or other organs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa17">While my delegation understands the circumstances under which a revolving credit fund was proposed by the Secretary-General, we must not ignore the fact that some Member States have huge amounts of arrears. Such a fund is not necessary so long as Member States fulfil their Charter obligations to pay their assessments in full, on time and without conditions. Unless there is a marked improvement in reducing arrears, such a fund is simply a palliative and will be readily depleted. We therefore doubt the feasibility of obtaining voluntary contributions -- convincing Member States to make contributions of such magnitude or coming up with alternative financing of such magnitude from other sources.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa18">We also have serious problems with the proposed notification procedure after 90 days. Appropriate consideration should be given to the timing of a Member State's fiscal year. We appreciate the qualification given in the paper by the Secretariat entitled "The impact of the implementation of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures". While my delegation understands the need to rationalize and render more effective the work of the United Nations and respects the authority of the Secretary-General as the chief administrative officer, the delegation of authority in the financial and human resources fields should be studied carefully, on the basis of the relevant discussions of Member States concerning policy matters in this field.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa19">As regards the proposal of the Secretary-General on core resources for development, Japan, as a strong supporter of United Nations operational activities, is seriously concerned about the trend toward declining core resources. In order to ensure the availability of necessary resources for operational activities of funds and programmes, it will be necessary to develop an overall funding strategy, including non-core resources, taking into account the specific nature of individual funds and programmes. We hope the discussions on funding strategies that are currently being undertaken in other forums will provide a good basis for a substantive decision by the General Assembly in a timely manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa20">Let me conclude by assuring the Assembly that my delegation will continue to act constructively for the early resolution of this issue.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa01">Renewal of the United Nations is crucial if we are to effectively meet future challenges. Reform is necessary in order to strengthen the United Nations capacity to assist the developing countries, to deal with complex humanitarian crises and to mitigate and prevent conflicts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Norway reiterates its full support for the reform package of the Secretary-General, including the important decisions adopted at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. It is now up to the Member States to implement and follow up on this reform package. We share the ambition to make the United Nations more effective and thereby more relevant to its Member States, and we believe that the current reform initiatives are important steps in this direction. We hope that Member States will join forces in preparing the United Nations for the challenges of the next century.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Norway welcomes the follow-up papers to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-12.pdf">General Assembly resolution 52/12</a> B and would like to comment briefly on them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Norway supports the outline of the Development Account, based on savings resulting from administrative reforms. The Development Account expresses the essence of the purpose behind United Nations reforms: freeing administrative resources that can be reallocated for development purposes. The resources saved must go to global, regional and national development efforts, particularly to help developing countries follow up the commitments ensuing from United Nations conferences, while avoiding duplication. Furthermore, we support the principles and the objectives of the fund, in particular the aim of enabling developing countries to take advantage of the globalization of the world economy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Norway also welcomes the proposed Millennium Assembly, which will give Member States an opportunity to discuss and agree upon fundamental guidelines and policy recommendations for the next century. We support the proposed preparations leading up to this event. We are somewhat disappointed that the proposal to establish a special commission to evaluate the institutional framework of the United Nations has been put on ice. We believe that the fundamental questions put forward in the Secretary-General's reform programme should be discussed as an integral part of the preparations leading up to the Millennium Assembly and should not wait until afterwards.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa06">Norway further welcomes the proposal to establish sunset provisions on new initiatives. Ensuring that new initiatives are adequately followed up within a set time-frame is in everyone's interest. We agree that it is also important to improve the review mechanisms for existing mandates.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Norway also supports the Secretary-General's initiative to delegate authority. This should lead to a more efficient, effective and transparent Organization. We therefore welcome the clarification provided by the Secretary-General in his paper entitled "The impact of the implementation of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures" [<a href="../pdf/A-52-852.pdf">A/52/852</a>].</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa08">Norway is deeply concerned about the financial situation of the United Nations, in particular the decline in resources for development activities. We clearly need a mode of financing that will ensure a predictable and continuous supply of resources. It is disturbing that only a handful of countries are providing the bulk of resources for United Nations development activities. Private donors can never assume the responsibility of Governments. In order to ensure fair burden-sharing, we need to consider the introduction of negotiated pledges and assessed contributions as a supplement to voluntary contributions. The Nordic countries have put forward a proposal based on these principles. In this context, we appreciate the Secretary-General's proposal to introduce negotiated contributions for financing United Nations development activities. The establishment of an Office of Development Financing, with the aim of exploring new and innovative funding mechanisms, also has our full support.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa09">The work of the United Nations is hampered by its precarious financial situation. Norway is willing to consider mechanisms aimed at improving the financial basis of the United Nations. We must, however, see to it that improvements in United Nations liquidity do not serve as a pretext for Member States to shirk their Charter obligations. It is essential that all countries pay their dues in full, on time and unconditionally. The proposed Revolving Credit Fund should be considered in this context.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa10">There is a clear need for a high-level review of global environmental problems. We therefore look forward to the proposals of the United Nations Environment Programme Task Force on environmental and human settlement issues.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa11">The General Assembly is the appropriate forum for discussing the papers before us today. We should make swift and concrete decisions on most issues. In a few instances, further discussions and clarifications may be required -- for example, with regard to the financing of development activities and the reconstitution of the Trusteeship Council. But here, too, we should aim at concrete results before too long.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa12">United Nations reform, like all reform processes, requires a clear sense of purpose and clear priorities. If we succeed in our reform efforts, the United Nations may assume the role and prominence foreseen by its founding fathers. If we do not succeed, we run the risk that the United Nations system will become marginalized, to the detriment of us all.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk01-pa13">Finally, I would like to welcome Deputy Secretary-General Louise Fréchette upon her formal assumption of office. We wish her success in her new functions.</div>

	Mr. Baali (Algeria)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I should like from the outset to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for your initiative in convening the Assembly today in order to continue our consideration of a question that has become so vital for us: the reform of the United Nations -- an issue that, under your presidency, has experienced undeniable progress, largely due to your efforts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa02">I should also like to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General for the excellent introduction that he has just provided to the additional reports requested by Member States in the framework of the resolutions on reform and on the programme budget for 1998-1999. Thus, to his credit, he has solemnly complied with our request to introduce the reports as scheduled.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa03">In addition, I should like to extend a well-deserved tribute to Mrs. Louise Fréchette, the first high-ranking official to occupy this eminent new post, that has come out of the reforms. We are convinced that she is better able than anyone else to imbue this important post with the spirit of public service, with enthusiasm and with knowledge of the sensibilities of States that our Organization so greatly needs today. I should like to take this opportunity to welcome her among us and to assure her of our full support in the difficult task that lies ahead for her.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa04">My delegation would like to associate itself fully with the statement made by the representative of Colombia on behalf of the Joint Coordinating Committee of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and China.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Having taken note of the various reports officially submitted today, which surely constitute a qualitatively new stage in the continuing and deepening reform process that began last year, Algeria would like from the outset to reaffirm here that it attaches great importance to the work of restructuring and revitalizing the United Nations system and to reiterate our desire to commit ourselves fully to this beneficial and necessary endeavour.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa06">It is therefore in a serious, responsible and constructive spirit that we will consider these reports and in due course express our views and comments.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa07">At this point in the debate, however, my delegation would like to comment on certain aspects that are more closely related to procedure than to substance. In this regard, we wish to note the deep interest it attaches to these reports' being sent to the competent organs specifically under agenda item 157, because we are convinced that, before any decision whatsoever is taken on the proposals before us, it is important that they be considered and clearly identified with reform in their original framework.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa08">This allocation to the Commissions will obviously need to be done in such a way as to enable a coherent, complete and integrated study of the various proposals. Thus, we feel that the report on core resources for development should be sent to the Second Committee, which we believe to be the appropriate body to consider the Secretary-General's proposals and the possibility of establishing a new system for core resources.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa09">Similarly, the Fifth Committee would seem to be the proper body to study the report on the utilization of the Development Account, since the Account now has legal status and has even benefited from funding by virtue of paragraph 106 of part III of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-220.pdf">resolution 52/220</a>, following the abolition of the High-level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development. The Fifth Committee, on that occasion, would undertake to determine the viability of the Account and the reliability of the potential sources of savings, as well as the long-term dependability of the resources to be released and hence the potential longevity of the Development Account. The Fifth Committee would do all this while ensuring that the overall level of future budgets of the Organization are in no way affected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa10">We believe that the reports contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-52-822.pdf">A/52/822</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-52-852.pdf">A/52/852</a> -- concerning, respectively, the revolving credit fund and the impact of the implementation of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures -- should, quite naturally, be sent to the Fifth Committee. Here again, the Committee would examine the Secretary-General's detailed proposals, especially as regards the feasibility and modalities of establishing a revolving credit fund. This, of course, should be done only within strict respect for the principle of the United Nations Charter in accordance with which the expenses of the Organization are assumed by the Members on the basis of the apportionment decided by the General Assembly -- in other words, on the basis of assessments -- with the requirement that Member States make their contributions fully, on time and without condition.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa11">As for the reports on longer-term changes that fall within the ongoing United Nations reform process, the Algerian delegation, in this connection, supports the proposal made by the Joint Coordinating Committee of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and China. In fact, we feel that the establishment of a working group of the General Assembly, open to all Member States, would be the appropriate way to make an in-depth and transparent study of the contents of these proposals, aimed at making fundamental changes for the future of our Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg014-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, my delegation wishes once again to reaffirm here its complete dedication to the process of reforming the United Nations in order to enable it to face the challenges of the next millennium while retaining its original personality and assuming its role in accordance with the aspirations of the States by whose will it exists and without whose full and resolute participation no reform worthy of the name can take lasting shape.</div>

	Mr. Babar (Pakistan)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your re-election to the Ukrainian Parliament and to say how pleased we are to see you in our midst, guiding our work. We would also like to avail ourselves of this opportunity to extend our felicitations to the new Deputy Secretary-General for assuming her new responsibilities. We are thankful to the Secretary-General for his statement and for submitting his reports in a timely manner in pursuance of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-12.pdf">resolution 52/12</a> B.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa02">My delegation associates itself fully with the statement made earlier by the Chairman of the Joint Coordinating Committee of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and China. We support the proposal that reports <a href="../pdf/A-52-822.pdf">A/52/822</a> on the revolving credit fund, <a href="../pdf/A-52-847.pdf">A/52/847</a> on the core resources for development and <a href="../pdf/A-52-848.pdf">A/52/848</a> on the utilization of the Development Account be referred to the relevant Committees of the General Assembly for consideration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa03">We also note from report <a href="../pdf/A-52-849.pdf">A/52/849</a> that the Secretary-General will be submitting at a later date his proposals regarding a new concept of trusteeship, by taking into account the report to be submitted to him by the Task Force on environmental and human settlement areas established under the chairmanship of the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa04">My delegation concurs with the proposal that an open-ended working group of the General Assembly be set up to consider the important political issues contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-850.pdf">A/52/850</a>, entitled "A Millennium Assembly, the United Nations system (Special Commission) and a Millennium Forum", and in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-851.pdf">A/52/851</a>, entitled "Time limits of new initiatives ( sunset' provisions)".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa05">The following are our initial comments on the Secretary-General's proposals contained in his seven reports.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa06">First, the financial crisis of the Organization has led to serious difficulties for both the Organization and the Member States. In our view, the establishment of a revolving credit fund would not rid the Organization of its financial crisis. While it may provide some relief, the solution to the problem lies in the payment of dues by all Member States, especially those that are major contributors and have the capacity to pay their dues. Despite our reservations on this proposal, we are ready to support the consideration of this issue in the Fifth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa07">Secondly, we are not sure that the report <a href="../pdf/A-52-847.pdf">A/52/847</a> on the core resources for development offers any solution for resolving, in the short term, the problem of diminishing core resources for development. We appreciate nonetheless that the Secretary-General has reiterated the need to address this issue. In our view, it is essential that adequate resources be available on a predictable, continuous and assured basis for this purpose. For development activities, we support the proposal that immediate and effective steps be taken to achieve greater predictability through multi-year voluntary pledges and the idea that safeguards are needed against currency volatility. The developed countries should also meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa08">Thirdly, as regards utilization of the Development Account, we find it difficult to understand how the Account would be maintained in the light of the perpetual financial crisis of the Organization. We would like to reiterate our view that the United Nations balance sheet does not support the Secretary-General's optimism in this regard and also that the idea of a development dividend is certainly no solution for the development needs of the developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa09">The Secretary-General himself underlined in document <a href="../pdf/A-51-950.pdf">A/51/950</a> that the continuing cash-flow crisis had made it difficult to stem the mounting tide of debts owed to Member States contributing troops to peacekeeping operations. We have been informed time and again that since 1995 the Organization has been borrowing extensively from the peacekeeping budget. The Organization is thus faced with an extraordinary situation in which money due to developing countries is being used to offset the crisis created by the non-payment of assessed contributions by major contributors. We therefore require far-reaching measures to address the immediate financial crisis of the United Nations and the development needs of the developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa10">Fourthly, as regards document <a href="../pdf/A-52-851.pdf">A/52/851</a>, concerning time limits of new initiatives, or sunset provisions, it is recalled that in paragraph 44 of document <a href="../pdf/A-51-950.pdf">A/51/950</a>, as in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-851.pdf">A/52/851</a>, the Secretary-General refers to sunset provisions, suggesting that each initiative that involves a new organizational structure and/or a major commitment of funds could be subjected to specific time limits. We also recall in this regard the statement made by the Secretary-General in the General Assembly on 12 November 1997, in which he stated that sunset provisions would be introduced only for new mandates. In this regard, we would like to reiterate our position that Pakistan cannot accept sunset provisions for missions which are already established, such as the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization and the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan, as the issues they were called upon to address have not been resolved.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa11">Finally, we appreciate the detailed note by the Secretary-General, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-850.pdf">A/52/850</a>, on a Millennium Assembly, the United Nations system (Special Commission) and a Millennium Forum. We support the proposal that the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly should be designated as the Millennium Assembly. Its high-level segment, known as Millennium Summit, could be devoted to the theme "The United Nations in the twenty-first century". We shall be looking forward to the Secretary-General's report on this subject. We also welcome the proposal that a Millennium Forum should precede the Millennium Assembly. We note from the Secretary-General's note that consultations among non-governmental organizations towards that end have already begun.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Tchoulkov" nation="Russia" language="Russian">
	Mr. Tchoulkov (Russia)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa01">First, I wish on behalf of my delegation to welcome Ms. Fréchette and to wish her every success in the very important post of Deputy Secretary-General.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa02">I should like to thank the Secretary-General for preparing and introducing new documents on a number of aspects related to reform, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-12.pdf">General Assembly resolution 52/12</a> B. These clarify the earlier more general approach to efforts to enhance the effectiveness and viability of the Organization. In our view, one way of ensuring progress in reform is to gain active and constructive support for proposed measures and initiatives by all Member States. It is therefore of the utmost importance that these measures should be rational and balanced, and that to the greatest extent possible they should reflect our common interests. We understand that this task is by no means easy, and we are willing to do our utmost to facilitate a solution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa03">We believe that, in order to move forward, it is essential first to give thorough consideration to the documents before us. Given the specific and sometimes highly specialized nature of the issues they address, it may be necessary to call upon the expertise of the relevant committees of the General Assembly. This should make it possible to achieve broad agreement on further reform steps. We trust that delegations will be able to get answers to the questions that concern them, and that they will have an opportunity to study thoroughly the ideas placed before them and adjust them when necessary.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa04">At this stage, my delegation will not give a detailed assessment of the documents before us, but will make only a few general comments.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa05">On the whole, our response to the Secretary-General's proposals on the Development Account is positive, but we would like more detailed information on a number of points, such as where productivity gains will be sought on an ongoing basis, how the implementation machinery will function, and how programmes will be monitored and assessed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa06">We also support the proposals on time limits of new initiatives -- sunset provisions. We believe it would be useful to seek the views of the Committee for Programme and Coordination and other relevant bodies on possible ways to extend this practice to existing mandates.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa07">We continue to have grave doubts about the idea and mechanism of establishing a revolving credit fund. This would basically amount to a system of financial penalties and incentives, and it is well known that in the United Nations this concept has not been thoroughly thought through or agreed upon. Incidentally, there is no mention of the need to take into account the reasons for a failure to pay. We have a number of questions on the specifics of implementing this proposal. These include questions on how the fund would actually function, on the return of surpluses and on the conditions under which the fund would be terminated. Many other questions also remain.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa08">As to a new concept of trusteeship, we believe that the work of the Task Force to which the Secretary-General refers could shed light on several aspects of this new concept, on which we continue to have a number of questions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa09">Turning to the Secretary-General's proposals for a Millennium Assembly, we trust that appropriate stress will be placed on the financial viability of the plans, with a view to minimizing expenditures.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa10">We intend to give thorough study to the Secretary-General's new proposals on changes to the system of contributions to core resources for the operational activities of United Nations programmes and funds. Russia believes it important to stabilize the funding for the operational activities of the United Nations, in the interest of recipient countries. At the same time, the question of ensuring adequate and predictable financing must be resolved on the basis of preserving the voluntary nature of the contributions system. Resources might be supplemented by further expanding the practice of burden-sharing and by links with the financing of the private sector and non-governmental organizations. We consider that important work is under way in the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Food Programme on preparing a strategy for stable financing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa11">Here I would refer also to the work of the various open-ended working groups in which Member States participate; we should take account of their work in determining our position on the note of the Secretary-General. Once our Governments have assessed the outcome of the work of the working groups, and once we have studied the proposals set out in the note, it would be worthwhile in our view to return in the context of the Second Committee to the question of financing operational activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa12">We welcome the useful information provided by the Secretary-General in the document on the impact of the implementation of pilot projects and budgetary practices and procedures, and we trust that this will be duly be taken account of subsequently.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, I would like to say just a couple of words on procedure. We support the emerging view on referring to the Second and Fifth Committees the reports on the revolving credit fund, the impact of the implementation of pilot projects and budgetary practices and procedures and the report on the Development Account. We believe that we could consider the other reports within the context of the informal consultations of the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa01">The Canadian delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General and his team for their recent reports on the important process of the reform of the United Nations. We welcome the designation of Deputy Secretary-General Louise Fréchette as the senior Secretariat official responsible for directing the implementation and the follow-up of the reform process. We look forward to working with her in this important endeavour, which remains essential to the preservation of the credibility and the authority of the United Nations. We look forward to presenting our views on the substantive matters still before us once we have decided how we will continue to conduct this process of United Nations reform.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa02">On the matter of next steps and the appropriate venue for further discussion, the Canadian delegation agrees with the European Union and others that the General Assembly, meeting in plenary session, is indeed the appropriate forum for discussion and action on the weighty reform issues before us. We believe that, at least at this initial stage, it would not be useful to fragment and divide the various reforms proposals and send elements piecemeal to a variety of subsidiary bodies. We believe that the coordination and policy-guidance responsibilities of the General Assembly remain critical to the achievement of comprehensive success across the reform agenda.</div>

	Mr. Cho (Republic of Korea)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa01">My delegation would first of all like to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for the reports he presented in response to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-12.pdf">General Assembly resolution 52/12</a> B. My delegation has carefully studied these reports, and I should like to make some preliminary comments.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa02">My delegation supports the proposal of the Secretary-General, in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-850.pdf">A/52/850</a>, to convene the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly as a Millennium Assembly with a summit segment. We welcome the Secretary-General's intention to prepare a report on the theme of the Millennium Assembly, and for our part we are prepared to contribute to the preparation process by submitting our proposals on two or three possible themes for the Millennium Assembly at a later stage.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa03">We concur with the idea of establishing a special commission at the ministerial level to examine relations among the various component parts of the United Nations system and their ability to adjust to the challenges of the new millennium. In this context, we hope that the Millennium Assembly will endeavour to establish the special commission.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa04">We support the proposal of the Secretary-General that non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors organize a Millennium Forum in connection with the Millennium Assembly. However, given the diverse characters, size and objectives of non-governmental organizations, we are of the view that the idea of the Millennium Forum should be further elaborated. In particular, careful examination should be given to how the outcome of the Forum could be reflected in the future activities of the United Nations, with a view to obtaining substantial results from the Forum.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa05">With regard to the revolving credit fund, we appreciate the report of the Secretary-General contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-822.pdf">A/52/822</a> for elaborating some of the practical aspects of its implementation. However, my delegation is still not fully convinced of the practicability of establishing $1 billion fund through voluntary contributions. As we pointed out during the informal consultations, capitalization at a level of up to $1 billion through voluntary contributions would place an additional financial burden on Member States which faithfully abide by their treaty obligations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa06">My delegation fully supports the proposal of the Secretary-General to establish a Development Account generated by savings in administrative costs. We take note of the well-defined principles governing utilization and performance criteria, in <a href="../pdf/A-52-848.pdf">A/52/848</a>, and expect them to be implemented successfully.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa07">The Republic of Korea attaches great importance to international development cooperation to assist developing countries with a view to promoting higher standards of living, full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development. The Secretary-General's note on core resources for development, in <a href="../pdf/A-52-847.pdf">A/52/847</a>, identifies problems with current funding arrangements for core resources and suggests several means to ameliorate them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa08">With regard to the issue of multi-year pledges, it is our view that they are effective in enhancing greater funding predictability. However, because domestic budgetary systems and procedures differ from country to country, the idea of implementing pledges in only multi-year tranches may not be totally realistic. In our view, the most effective solution might be to find an appropriate mix between multi-year pledges and the current one-year pledge which may be more suitable to the diverse circumstances of Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa09">Concerning sunset provisions, Korea believes that their introduction will encourage the Organization to develop and implement mandated programmes and activities in a more effective and efficient manner. We therefore support the recommendation contained in the Secretary-General's note in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-851.pdf">A/52/851</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa10">As to document <a href="../pdf/A-52-852.pdf">A/52/852</a>, on the impact of the implementation of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures, my delegation concurs with the conclusion that it is within the purview of the Secretary-General to delegate his authorities and responsibilities to programme and line managers. We welcome the intention of the Secretary-General to pursue the delegation of authority as an instrument for management improvement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa11">However, my delegation wishes to emphasize that the delegation of authority should be synchronized with enhanced accountability of line managers. Unless this is done, the possibility may arise wherein line managers execute their delegated authority in an arbitrary manner. Therefore, my delegation urges the Secretary-General to undertake a performance appraisal system that effectively monitors and enhances the accountability of line managers. My delegation looks forward to the report on the implementation of the pilot projects at the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa12">Concerning the new concept of trusteeship, my delegation is of the view that issues related to the integrity of the global environment and such common areas as the oceans, atmosphere and outer space maintain paramount significance for the future of all mankind. However, the reconstitution of the Trusteeship Council towards that end should be examined with utmost prudence. Therefore, my delegation would like to submit its comments upon examination of the Task Force's forthcoming proposals on environment and human settlements.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa13">Finally, regarding the matter of how we proceed to discuss the reports introduced by the Secretary-General, my delegation favours the proposal that the note on the "Core resources for development" be referred to the Second Committee and the documents on the "Revolving Credit Fund", the "Utilization of the Development Account" and "The impact of the implementation of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures" be referred to the Fifth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa14">As for other remaining issues -- the Millennium Assembly, trusteeship and sunset provisions -- my delegation favours the idea of establishing an open-ended working group of the General Assembly to address these issues in depth.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa15">To conclude, the Korean delegation wishes to reiterate its full support for the reform process initiated by the Secretary-General. Like other delegations, my delegation would also like to welcome Deputy Secretary-General Louise Fréchette on her assumption of an important office of this Organization.</div>
