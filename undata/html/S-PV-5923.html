	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the 8 June Road Map for the Return of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and Implementation of the Abyei Protocol (the Road Map) between the National Congress Party (NCP) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM). The Security Council emphasizes that a peaceful resolution of the situation in Abyei is vital to the effective implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and peace in the region. The Security Council welcomes the agreements in the Road Map, including its provisions regarding revenue sharing and the interim boundaries in Abyei. The Security Council urges the parties to use the opportunity created by the signing of the Road Map to resolve all outstanding issues related to CPA implementation and welcomes the parties' commitment to take unresolved issues to arbitration as necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council deeply regrets the recent outbreak of fighting in Abyei, the ensuing displacement of civilians and the obstruction of the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) freedom of movement. The Security Council urges the parties to facilitate immediate humanitarian support for the displaced citizens and support for their voluntary return as soon as an interim administration and the agreed security arrangements are in place.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council encourages the parties to fully implement the Road Map within the agreed timelines, in particular with the establishment of an Abyei Area Administration; deployment of a new Joint Integrated Unit battalion; ensuring of free movement for UNMIS forces in the Abyei area and access to the north and south of the Abyei area to carry out its mandate to support implementation of the CPA; and redeployment of the Sudan Armed Forces and SPLM troops outside the interim Abyei administrative area agreed to by the parties.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council calls on UNMIS, within its mandate and in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1812(2008).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1812 (2008)</a>, to robustly deploy, as appropriate, peacekeeping personnel in and around Abyei to help reduce tensions and prevent escalation of conflict, in support of implementation of the CPA. The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to examine the root causes of and the role played by UNMIS in connection with the violence between the parties in Abyei in May 2008 and consider what follow-up steps may be appropriate for UNMIS."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-24.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/24</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
