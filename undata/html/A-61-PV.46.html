	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">As members will recall, when the 45th plenary meeting was adjourned this morning, there remained one seat from among the Eastern European States to be filled.

The third round of balloting will, in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, also be the second restricted ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">This third round of balloting shall be restricted to the two States from among the Eastern European States that were not elected but obtained the largest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely, Belarus and Bulgaria. That is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>
