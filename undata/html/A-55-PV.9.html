	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk12-pa03">In that connection, the Committee also draws the attention of the Assembly to the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241.pdf">resolution 51/241</a> (<a href="../pdf/A-52-855.pdf">A/52/855</a>), in particular to paragraphs 16 and 17, which highlight the subsequent action that needs to be taken and the difficulty that will be encountered in implementing that provision. As stated in paragraph 17 of the Secretary-General's report, in recent years the closing date has been the Monday before the opening of the next session. Were the General Assembly to retain this practice, the closing date would consistently fall on an official holiday of the Organization, for which financial and other implications may need to be considered. Paragraph 17 of that report further states that the General Assembly may wish to decide on a closing date for future sessions that will fall on a working day.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk12-pa05">In paragraph 47, the General Committee, taking into account the opening date of the regular sessions, also recommends to the Assembly a review of the question of the mandatory deadline for the submission to the Fifth Committee of all draft resolutions having programme budget implications.</div>
