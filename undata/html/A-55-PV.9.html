	<div class="blockquote">"plenary meetings of the General Assembly shall be formally opened every year on the first Tuesday following 1 September".</div>
	<div class="p">In that connection, the Committee also draws the attention of the Assembly to the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241">resolution 51/241</a> (<a href="../pdf/A-52-855">A/52/855</a>), in particular to paragraphs 16 and 17, which highlight the subsequent action that needs to be taken and the difficulty that will be encountered in implementing that provision. As stated in paragraph 17 of the Secretary-General's report, in recent years the closing date has been the Monday before the opening of the next session. Were the General Assembly to retain this practice, the closing date would consistently fall on an official holiday of the Organization, for which financial and other implications may need to be considered. Paragraph 17 of that report further states that the General Assembly may wish to decide on a closing date for future sessions that will fall on a working day.</div>
	<div class="p">In paragraph 46, the General Committee, noting the ad hoc decisions that had to be taken by the General Assembly concerning the opening and/or closing dates of the fifty-second, fifty-third, fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth sessions, recommends to the Assembly that it address, during its fifty-fifth session, the question of the opening and closing dates of future regular sessions with a view to deciding on a formula to determine the opening and closing dates of future regular sessions.</div>
	<div class="p">In paragraph 47, the General Committee, taking into account the opening date of the regular sessions, also recommends to the Assembly a review of the question of the mandatory deadline for the submission to the Fifth Committee of all draft resolutions having programme budget implications.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the General Assembly takes note of paragraph 45 and approves the recommendations contained in paragraphs 46 and 47?</div>

	<div class="p"> The General Assembly has thus concluded its consideration of the first report of the General Committee. I wish to thank all the members of the Assembly for their kind cooperation at this meeting.</div>
	<div class="p">Each main Committee will receive the list of agenda items allocated to it so that it may begin and organize its work in accordance with rule 99 of the rules of procedure and paragraphs 30 and 31 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241">resolution 51/241</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, kindly again note that the First Committee should complete its work by Friday, 3 November; the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) by Thursday, 9 November; the Third Committee by Friday 10 November; the Sixth Committee by Tuesday, 21 November; and the Second and Fifth Committees by Friday, 1 December 2000.</div>
	<div class="p">I hope that the Main Committees will continue the effort they demonstrated in the fifty-fourth session in concluding their work on time.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to recall and underline that all meetings must start punctually at 10 a.m. and at 3 p.m., and I personally intend to ensure that we all keep to our commitment taken today. This undertaking also applies to the Secretariat, which must ensure that all documentation in all languages is available on time so that meetings can proceed without any delay.</div>
	<div class="p">I should now like to draw the attention of representatives to a matter concerning the participation of Palestine, in its capacity as observer, in the sessions and work of the General Assembly. Members will recall <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-250">resolution 52/250</a> of 7 July 1998 and its annex, as well as a note by the Secretary-General contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-1002">A/52/1002</a> that outlines the Secretary-General's understanding of the implementation of the modalities annexed to the resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to draw the Assembly's attention in particular to paragraph 6 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-250">resolution 52/250</a>, which reads as follows:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The right to make interventions, with a precursory explanation or the recall of relevant General Assembly resolutions being made only once by the President of the General Assembly at the start of each session of the Assembly".</div>
	<div class="p">Accordingly, for the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the observer of Palestine will therefore participate in the work of the General Assembly in accordance with resolution 3237 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-43-177">resolution 43/177</a> of 15 December 1988 and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-250">resolution 52/250</a> of 7 July 1998, with no further need for a precursory explanation prior to any intervention by Palestine in this session.</div>
