	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have received photocopies of a letter dated 4 August 1995 from the Chargé d'affaires <i>ad interim </i>of the Permanent Mission of Croatia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, which will be issued as <a href="../pdf/S-1995-647.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/647</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council is deeply concerned at the resumption of hostilities in and around the Republic of Croatia. The Council recalls the statement of its President of 3 August 1995. It strongly deplores the decision by the Croatian Government to launch a broad military offensive, thereby unacceptably escalating the conflict, with the risk of further consequent attacks by whatever party, and demands that all military action cease immediately and that there be full compliance with all Council resolutions including <a href="../pdf/S-RES-994(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 994 (1995)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council condemns any shelling of civilian targets. It demands that no military action be taken against civilians and that their human rights be fully respected. It reminds the parties of their responsibilities under international humanitarian law and reiterates that those who commit violations of international humanitarian law will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts. The Council calls on the parties to cooperate fully with UNCRO, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross in ensuring access and protection to the local civilian population as appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council strongly condemns attacks by Croatian Government forces on personnel of the United Nations peace-keeping forces which have resulted in casualties, including the death of one member of the peace-keeping forces. It demands that such attacks cease immediately and that all detained personnel be released. It also reminds the parties, and in particular the Croatian Government, that they have an obligation to respect United Nations personnel, to ensure their safety and freedom of movement at all times and to enable UNCRO to fulfil its mandate in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. The Council expresses condolences to the Government of Denmark and to the family of the member of the United Nations peace-keeping forces who lost his life.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council deeply regrets the breakdown of the talks which began in Geneva on 3 August 1995. It calls upon the Croatian Government to return to the talks. It reiterates that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Croatia. It reaffirms its call for an unreserved commitment to the search for a negotiated settlement and to resumption of talks on the basis of the Draft Agreement drawn up by the Co-Chairman of the Steering Committee of the International Conference</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">on the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council will remain seized of the matter, and will consider any further measures that may be necessary."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-38.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/38</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
