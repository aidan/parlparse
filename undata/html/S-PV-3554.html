	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the following documents: <a href="../pdf/S-1995-563.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/563</a>, letter dated 12 July 1995 from the Chargé d'affaires <i>ad interim</i> of the Permanent Mission of Morocco to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting a statement adopted on 11 July 1995 by the Organization of the Islamic Conference Contact Group at its meeting on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina; <a href="../pdf/S-1995-571.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/571</a>, letter dated 13 July 1995 from the chargé d'affaires <i>ad interim </i>of the Permanent Mission of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council; <a href="../pdf/S-1995-572.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/572</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1995-573.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/573</a>, letters dated 13 July 1995 from the chargé d'affaires <i>ad interim </i>of the Permanent Mission of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General; and <a href="../pdf/S-1995-574.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/574</a>, letter dated 12 July 1995 from the Permanent Representative of Spain to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, transmitting the text of a communiqué on Srebrenica issued by the Presidency on 12 July 1995 on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council recalls its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1004(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1004 (1995)</a>. The Council is deeply concerned about the ongoing forced relocation of tens of thousands of civilians from the Srebrenica safe area to the Tuzla region by the Bosnian Serb party. Such a forced relocation is a clear violation of the human rights of the civilian population. It is especially concerned about reports of grave mistreatment and killing of innocent civilians. It is equally concerned about reports that up to 4,000 men and boys have been forcibly removed by the Bosnian Serb party from the Srebrenica safe area. It demands that in conformity with internationally recognized standards of conduct and international law the Bosnian Serb party release them immediately, respect fully the rights of the civilian population of the Srebrenica safe area and other persons protected under international humanitarian law, and permit access by the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council again condemns the unacceptable practice of ethnic cleansing' and reaffirms that those who have committed or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council demands that the Bosnian Serb party immediately allow unimpeded access to the civilian population of the Srebrenica safe area by international humanitarian organizations and cooperate with any procedure established by those organizations to determine which civilians wish to depart the area of Srebrenica. It further demands that the Bosnian Serb party respect fully the rights of those civilians who wish to remain in the safe area and cooperate with efforts to ensure that civilians who wish to depart are allowed to do so with their families in an orderly, safe way in conformity with international law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council demands that both sides allow the unhindered movement of humanitarian relief and cooperate with efforts by international organizations and agencies and concerned Governments to provide food, medicine, facilities, and housing to the displaced.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council reiterates its demand that the Bosnian Serb forces immediately and unconditionally release unharmed all detained personnel of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), and that the parties respect fully the safety of all UNPROFOR personnel and ensure their complete freedom of movement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"The Security Council pays tribute to all the personnel of UNPROFOR, and of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, especially those deployed in the area of Srebrenica. It notes that the presence and bravery of the troops has undoubtedly saved the lives of many civilians in the Srebrenica area."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-32.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/32</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
