	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council has been following closely the progress made by the Government of Mozambique and the Resistência Nacional Moçambicana (RENAMO) towards the implementation of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique. It commends them and the people of Mozambique for what has been achieved.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council believes that the necessary conditions have now been established for the holding of free and fair elections on 27 and 28 October under effective national and international monitoring. These elections, by providing the Mozambican people with an opportunity fully to exercise their right to vote, hold out the prospect of securing for them lasting peace, stability and democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council appeals to all concerned to ensure that the election campaign and the subsequent voting are conducted in a calm and responsible manner; that the elections are held freely and fairly; that those in authority act with complete impartiality in order to avoid any allegation of fraud; and that the election days and their aftermath are characterized by the absence of violence or the threat of violence. It also appeals to all parties to respect the safety and security of the officials of the National Elections Commission and the international election observers and to assist them to carry out their mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its intention to endorse the results of the elections should the United Nations declare them free and fair, and reminds the parties of their obligation, under the General Peace Agreement, fully to abide by the results.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council trusts that the parties will be guided, after the elections, by the spirit of reconciliation as well as the principles of democracy and the need to work together in harmony to reconstruct their country, thereby enabling the international community to continue to support Mozambique as it pursues rehabilitation and reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council takes this opportunity to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and the personnel of ONUMOZ and calls upon the parties to continue to cooperate with them to ensure the fulfilment of ONUMOZ's mandate, including verification of their complete demobilization and disarmament".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-61.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/61</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
