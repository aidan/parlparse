	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa01">On behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I have the honour to introduce to the General Assembly draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.33-Rev.1.pdf">A/59/L.33/Rev.1</a>, entitled "New Partnership for Africa's Development: progress in implementation and international support", as orally corrected. The draft resolution was arrived at through a consensus process and has the sponsorship of numerous countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa02">Africa faces serious challenges. Meeting them requires collective action by both African countries and the international community. The adoption of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) by the African Union in 2001 as an initiative owned and led by the continent and the General Assembly's subsequent endorsement of it as the framework for international support to Africa illustrate the resolve that exists to address the daunting challenges facing Africa. NEPAD offers great hope, which -- if matched with the requisite political will and commitment -- will enable Africa to claim the twenty-first century as its own.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa03">The main purpose of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.33-Rev.1.pdf">A/59/L.33/Rev.1</a> is to keep the spotlight on the efforts of African countries and to underscore the ongoing need for international support to complement those endeavours. In the past year, African countries have taken concrete steps to implement NEPAD through the development of sectoral policy frameworks, the design of specific projects and the establishment of expenditure targets in NEPAD priority areas. Those efforts require enabling national and international environments conducive to growth and development, with the participation of numerous stakeholders. Furthermore, it is important to keep Africa's particular circumstances in mind as the countdown to the 2005 major event begins. Accordingly, the draft resolution highlights areas of progress and need.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa04">I take this opportunity to extend my thanks to all delegations for their cooperation and support during the informal consultations on the draft resolution. I should like in particular to thank Mr. Abdellah Benmellouk of Morocco for his tireless efforts as facilitator of the draft resolution. Without his support, it would have been impossible to reach consensus on the draft resolution. In that regard, I should like to inform delegations -- other than those of the Group of 77 and China -- that may still wish to sponsor the draft resolution that they can do so from the floor before its adoption.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa05">On behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the other sponsors, I am pleased to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.33-Rev.1.pdf">A/59/L.33/Rev.1</a>, as orally corrected, for adoption as a consensus text. Finally, I wish to announce that Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, Turkey, Ukraine and the United States have joined in sponsoring the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa06">On behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I wish also to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.50-Rev.1.pdf">A/59/L.50/Rev.1</a>, entitled "Implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa07">The draft resolution was formulated in a consensus process. It takes note of the significant progress made in the prevention, mediation and resolution of conflicts, while recognizing that much remains to be done, especially with regard to emerging trends that could undermine the gains achieved in the consolidation of peace and sustainable development. The draft resolution welcomes the establishment by the African Union of its Peace and Security Council and looks forward to the establishment of other elements. It also welcomes the contributions of the United Nations system, development partners and other relevant stakeholders in conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa08">The consensus achieved is due in part to the skills of the facilitator, Felipe Costa, who gave his very best during the informal negotiations. Moreover, the flexibility and cooperation demonstrated by all delegations resulted in consensus after the second reading of the original draft text. We sincerely hope that that same spirit will prevail in 2005. I therefore thank all colleagues who participated in the informal consultations for their cooperation and support.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa09">Having introduced draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-59-L.50-Rev.1.pdf">A/59/L.50/Rev.1</a> on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I hope that the General Assembly will adopt it by consensus. I wish also to announce that Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Turkey have joined in sponsoring the draft resolution.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk14-pa03">Africa bears an overwhelming proportion of the malaria burden. Statistics from the World Health Organization show that malaria is Africa's leading cause of under-five mortality and an important cause of anaemia and other malarial complications in pregnant women, constitutes 10 per cent of the continent's overall disease burden, and accounts for 40 per cent of public health expenditure.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk14-pa04">Malaria is, however, a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable. It is thus in the effort to combat malaria, as well as to implement Millennium Development Goal Six, that the African Union is introducing the draft resolution entitled "2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk14-pa05">In its preambular part, the draft resolution takes note of the declarations and decisions on malaria adopted by the Organization of African Unity, in particular the declaration and plan of action on the "Roll Back Malaria" initiative adopted at the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held in Abuja on 24 and 25 April 2000, and the Maputo Declaration on Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases, adopted by the Assembly of the African Union at its second ordinary session, held in Maputo from 10 to 12 July 2003. In addition, the draft resolution recognizes the efforts being made to reach the targets set in the Abuja Summit as necessary and important for the attainment of the "Roll Back Malaria" goal and the targets of the United Nations Millennium Declaration.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk14-pa06">In the operative part, the draft resolution takes note of the Secretary-General's report contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-59-261.pdf">A/59/261</a> and calls for support of the recommendations contained therein. It also calls upon the international community to continue to support the "Roll Back Malaria" partner organizations and appeals to them to ensure increased support for bilateral and multilateral assistance to combat malaria, including support for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The draft resolution expresses concern about the resistant strains of malaria and urges the adoption of measures to combat that resistance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk14-pa07">My delegation wishes to thank all member States that participated in the discussion of the draft resolution. Their contributions have resulted in this important draft resolution, the implementation of which will facilitate the eradication of that deadly disease.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk07-pa01">My delegation wishes to explain its position on the draft resolutions adopted under agenda items 118 and 119.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk07-pa02">First, the delegation of Cuba attaches great importance to the work of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, a United Nations structure responsible for monitoring, audit, investigation, evaluation and inspection services. In that connection, we reiterate that the work of the Office must be fully in accordance with its mandate under resolutions 48/218 B and 54/244.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk07-pa03">Secondly, the delegation of Cuba reaffirms the General Assembly's prerogative to consider and take action on all reports submitted to it, including the relevant reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. We do not believe that this restricts the role of the Office, but rather reinforces its authority, because such consideration gives Member States an opportunity to voice their opinions on the recommendations of the Office. Similarly, when formulating its recommendations, the Office must fully respect the prerogatives of the General Assembly with regard to the adoption, modification and abolition of mandates.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk07-pa04">Our delegation wishes to reaffirm that we have participated in the process of negotiating and adopting these resolutions, reflecting our serious-mindedness, commitment and respect for the negotiating process and for other delegations. It is not our practice to employ double standards in our work. We have too much self-respect for that. We similarly respect our colleagues. We therefore firmly reject statements levelled at us during formal meetings of the Fifth Committee, seeking to accuse my delegation of a lack of transparency in the negotiating process on these resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk07-pa05">Our Fifth Committee colleagues are very well aware of the Cuban delegation's transparency, responsibility and earnestness. They also know our commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, including respect for sovereignty. In that connection, I would note that, as it participates in these processes, my delegation reaffirms its sovereign right to defend its positions, while acting with the flexibility needed to make it possible to adopt draft resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk07-pa06">Here, my delegation wishes to reaffirm its thanks to and its support for the Bureau of the Fifth Committee, and the coordinator on these items; it was through their collective work that we were able to adopt these resolutions.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk12-pa02">First of all, Cuba is astonished that a serious debate on this issue was prevented in the context of the work of the Commission on Human Rights, and that there were intentional delays in negotiations both in the Committee for Programme and Coordination and in the General Assembly.

	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk12-pa04">It is therefore alarming that, in the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005, the authors of the original document completely ignored the language agreed upon on an intergovernmental basis. With regard to section A of subprogramme 1, the idea of using the strategic framework in order to change legislative mandates is cause for particular concern. We would like to place on record our reservations in that regard, and to say that we will continue to closely follow the implementation of that subprogramme. The promotion and protection of human rights should not be used as a tool to interfere in the internal affairs of the States Members of the Organization. Nor should attempts be made to rewrite the original mandate set out for the funds and programmes of the United Nations, either through a biased interpretation of the implementation of the whole host of human rights or by linking them to the activities undertaken by the various bodies of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk12-pa05">Such a distortion of the debates on issues pertaining to human rights only confirms the current trend whereby developed countries are hijacking many aspects of the work of the Organization in this area in an attempt to serve their own political interests, thereby obliterating any semblance of non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity in the workings of the United Nations human rights machinery. That only serves to produce further confrontation between developing and developed countries and to minimize progress towards true protection and promotion of human rights for all at all levels. In so doing, the United Nations would be going along with the role of judge in matters pertaining to human rights issues that some Member States have bestowed upon themselves while fully ignoring their own particular problems or those of their allies. None of that contributes to restoring the prestige being lost by United Nations bodies working in the field of human rights, starting with the Commission on Human Rights itself.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk12-pa06">Our delegation will work to ensure that the next United Nations goal-setting cycle in the area of human rights is as open and democratic as called for by the subject. We will also firmly oppose any recurrence of the situation we encountered this year.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk09-pa01">I have the honour to speak today on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The Group of 77 and China attaches the greatest importance to all the issues considered by the Fifth Committee, recommendations on which have been approved today by the General Assembly. In particular, the Group would like to highlight some of those issues. It should be understood that addressing only some of our decisions does not imply that others not highlighted are of any lesser importance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk09-pa02">The Group of 77 and China stresses that the Secretary-General should present the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007, in a form fully reflecting the priorities just approved by the General Assembly. Particular attention should be given to programmes and activities related to social and economic development. In this context, the Group of 77 and China emphasize the crucial importance of the implementation of the right to development and reaffirm the validity of the Declaration on the Right to Development. The Group hopes that the implementation of any efficiency measure will not impact negatively on mandated programmes and activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk09-pa03">The Group looks forward to the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-59-267.pdf">resolution 59/267</a>, on human resources management, in particular the results and findings of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors on the audit on the implementation of application of the principle of geographical representation at all levels. Furthermore, we reiterate the necessity of ensuring that women from developing countries are accorded equal opportunity in the recruitment process, and we look forward to the full implementation of the relevant paragraphs in that context.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk09-pa04">On the question of programme budget implications, the Group regrets that the General Assembly did not approve at this stage either a subvention or a payment for the rental and maintenance costs of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research. The Group will address this issue comprehensively during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk09-pa05">Concerning the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Group reiterates its full support to the role of that Office. The Group of 77 and China recognize the primary role of the General Assembly in the consideration of and action on the reports submitted to it, as reflected in paragraph 4 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-59-273.pdf">resolution 59/273</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk09-pa06">Finally, the Group of 77 and China would like to state that, in general, although they have small delegations, they endeavoured to participate actively at all levels of the negotiation process, whether at "informal informals" or in informal consultations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk09-pa07">This session was exceptional with regard to its workload. The Group of 77 and China delegations negotiated under the pressure of time and in very stressful situations, and often showed maximum flexibility to take on board the concerns of other delegations. The Group wishes to emphasize that all the negotiations were held in a very open, transparent and friendly atmosphere and in good faith.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk09-pa08">Furthermore, the Group emphasizes the need for building further confidence among all negotiating partners and ensuring respect for each other's position; we look forward to continuing this partnership in our future interactions.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa01">The Nigerian delegation, as coordinator for one of the agenda items the Chairman of the Group of 77 and China has just addressed -- agenda item 118, on the Office of Internal Oversight Services -- feels obliged to make this statement to address some issues that were raised during the Fifth Committee's meeting yesterday, 22 December 2004.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa02">Nigeria views with absolute seriousness, dedication and integrity any assignment conferred upon it. It was in that same spirit that we approached the responsibility of coordinating the Committee's work on agenda item 118, "Report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services". As the coordinator, Nigeria, to the best of its ability, remained totally neutral all through the discussions and the ensuing negotiations on the item.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa03">Furthermore, we truthfully and seriously reflected the wishes of the Fifth Committee, as expressed by all who participated in the negotiations. The draft text on this item, dated 6 December, contained in its paragraph 10 the words "endorses the applicable recommendation of OIOS". The Fifth Committee amended "applicable" to "relevant". The final text of the resolution, dated 10 December 2004, reflected this in its paragraph 7, which begins with the words as amended: "Endorses the relevant recommendation of the Office". It was therefore with utmost shock and disappointment that we heard some comments to the effect that some delegations -- which, as the coordinator on this item, we can confirm never missed a meeting on this item -- did not know how some words had "crept into" the text of the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa04">As we stated yesterday, Nigeria presented to the General Assembly for adoption the draft text that the Fifth Committee, acting on behalf of the General Assembly, had approved and adopted. We deeply regret the fact that our work on this agenda item, which was conducted in a most cordial atmosphere, was concluded in a most unfortunate manner, with unguarded, unfair and unwarranted statements by some delegations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa05">Nigeria wishes to seize this opportunity to once more express our appreciation to the Chairman of the Fifth Committee and to those delegations that spoke to commend us on the way we conducted the negotiations -- as well as to those who spoke to reject the unhealthy development that the Fifth Committee witnessed yesterday.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa06">It is our sincere hope that we will not witness such an incident again, as incidents of that kind do not in any way augur well for the work of this Organization.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="The President" nation="" language="French">
	The President
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa01">We have come to the end of the first phase of our work, a very busy but a productive period, when the General Assembly considered many agenda items. In particular, 279 resolutions were adopted, 208 of them by consensus. Before suspending the proceedings at this stage, let me just make a few brief observations on the progress achieved and on our work ahead.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa02">Among all the items that we took up, three major items characterize this first phase: continuing the process of the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly; publication of the report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change (<a href="../pdf/A-59-565.pdf">A/59/565</a>); and preparations for the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly, to be held in September 2005. On 17 December, by consensus, we adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-59-145.pdf">resolution 59/145</a>, on the organizational modalities for that event. Those three items exemplify our general thinking on reform, indeed, our thinking on the Organization's capacity to adapt to the challenges of our time.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa03">During the general debate, our leaders reaffirmed, inter alia, the need to reform the United Nations system. That augurs well, because the present reform process, if it is to succeed, must be supported by genuine political will. In fact, as the report of the High-level Panel has emphasized, and I concur, our institutions "will still only be as strong as the energy, resources and attention devoted to them by Member States and their leaders" (<i><a href="../pdf/A-59-565.pdf">A/59/565</a>, report, part four, synopsis</i>).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa04">With respect to the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly, I welcome the progress that has been made. In addition to what we did during the fifty-eighth session, we have also made some tremendous efforts, in terms both of content and of the rationalization of our programme of work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa05">We have undertaken implementation of resolutions 58/126 and 58/316, concerning the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly. The role of the General Committee grew during the first part of the fifty-ninth session. There were informal meetings to consider working methods, the revitalization of the Assembly and the preparation of the high-level plenary meeting to be held in 2005. Other informal meetings were held on the New Partnership for Africa's Development, on children and armed conflict and on humanitarian assistance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa06">In conformity with those two resolutions, the Main Commissions got down to rationalizing their programmes of work and their agendas. How could we fail to appreciate all the progress made towards restoring the authority and the central role of the General Assembly as a universal institution? Contrary to the common, but false, image of an impotent General Assembly, the work of women and men on a daily basis shows that the General Assembly is a dynamic institution indeed. Its decisions, while less spectacular, have for more than half a century fashioned the international order and will continue to transform our respective nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa07">A major element of the success of the revitalization process is the shared conviction of all Member States of the indispensable nature of the General Assembly. The Assembly remains the sole legitimate framework where all the nations of the world can express their aspirations. It makes a strong contribution to remoulding the face of the United Nations, giving it a little more radiance and credibility -- even though it is true that much remains to be done for us to live up to all our noble responsibilities under the Charter. In order to pursue the revitalization of the Assembly, I am counting on the support and assistance of all. As members know, I have appointed five facilitators who will be coordinating our collective efforts: the Permanent Representatives of Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Kenya, Singapore and Sweden. I have no doubt that they will be up to the task, and I urge members to support them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa08">The report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change is also a major contribution towards the objective of adapting the United Nations to the realities of the twenty-first century. Once again, I must congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who took the welcome initiative to write a report containing courageous proposals. Our consultations on the report, to be held in January, should enable us to provide appropriate responses to the great concerns of the day. We will also have to explore the recommendations of the Millennium Project report, under the guidance of Mr. Jeffrey Sachs, whose publication is scheduled for 17 January 2005. As I indicated in the road map that I submitted to members yesterday, Wednesday, 22 December 2004, the release of the Secretary-General's comprehensive report, which is expected in March 2005, will be the starting point for substantive consultations with an eye to the high-level plenary meeting in September 2005.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa09">If we want to ensure genuine collective security; if we want to eradicate poverty; if we want to put an end to deadly pandemics, particularly HIV/AIDS and malaria; if we want to eradicate war, transnational crime, famine and environmental degradation -- in short, if we truly want to build a model society for future generations, we must go beyond statements of principle and do our utmost to live up to our commitments, particularly in the social and economic fields. When we return in January 2005, we must therefore redouble our fervour to work to find concrete and appropriate solutions to the problems facing the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa10">We must advance the ongoing reform process in this crucial period in the Organization's history. In that regard, we must also make every effort to follow the road map so that we can prepare for the high-level plenary meeting to the best of our ability. By working together to prepare well for that very important September 2005 meeting, we will greatly help to bring about the changes so much needed by the Organization. We will thus provide the means to better meet the legitimate expectations of the world's peoples for more peace, justice, freedom and solidarity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa11">Before concluding, I should like once again to take this opportunity to congratulate all delegations on their valuable contributions to the formulation and adoption by consensus of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-59-145.pdf">resolution 59/145</a>, which enables us to plan now for the events of 2005 with a greater sense of calm. I should also like once again to sincerely thank the members of the Secretariat, particularly Mr. Jian Chen, Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management, and his Department for the inestimable support that they have consistently given me since I took office.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg020-bk05-pa12">Finally, I wish everyone all the best and a pleasant vacation.</div>
