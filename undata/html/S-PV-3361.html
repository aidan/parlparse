	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in the course of the Council's prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">&quot;The Security Council is deeply disturbed by the tragic incident that resulted in the deaths of the Presidents of Burundi and Rwanda on 6 April 1994 and the ensuing violence. The Council expresses regret at the incident. It invites the Secretary-General to collect all available information with all means at his disposal and report to the Council as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">&quot;The Security Council is following with great concern the situation as described by the Secretariat in its oral report. There has been considerable loss of lives, including the deaths of Government leaders, many civilians and at least ten Belgian peace-keepers as well as the reported kidnapping of others. The Council strongly condemns these horrific attacks and their perpetrators, who must be held responsible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">&quot;The Council strongly condemns all these acts of violence and in particular these attacks against United Nations personnel and urges the Rwandese security forces and military and paramilitary units to put an end to these attacks and to cooperate fully with</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">UNAMIR in the implementation of its mandate. It further demands that all measures be taken to provide security throughout the country and particularly in Kigali and the demilitarized zone (DMZ). Furthermore, the Council expresses its extreme concern at the implications for United Nations personnel and requests the Secretary-General to report on and take measures necessary to ensure their safety and security. The Council also demands that free access to the airport be restored in order to allow those who wish to enter or leave the country to do so.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">&quot;The Council appeals to all Rwandese and to all parties and factions to desist from any further acts or threats of violence and to maintain the positions they held before the incident. It urges respect for the safety and security of the civilian population and of the foreign communities living in Rwanda as well as of UNAMIR and other United Nations personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">&quot;The Security Council earlier this week renewed the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Rwanda for a further four months, with a six-week review provision on the understanding that progress would be made in establishing all the transitional institutions under the Arusha Peace Agreement. It reaffirms its commitment to the Arusha Peace Agreement and urges all parties to implement it fully and in particular to respect the cease-fire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">&quot;The Council will remain seized of the matter.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-16.pdf" class="nolink">S/PRST/1994/16</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
