The Group of Eastern European States hopes that the leaders and the people of Turkmenistan will manage to hold peaceful and democratic elections for the new leadership following Mr. Niyazov's sad passing.

	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">I should like, on behalf of the Group of Western European and other States, to convey our condolences to the Government and the people of Turkmenistan on the death of their President, Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov. Our condolences go also to the members of his family grieving at his loss.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">Mr. Niyazov had been the President of Turkmenistan since it gained independence, on 27 October 1991. Starting from humble beginnings and orphaned at an early age, Mr. Niyazov moved forcefully forward towards the leadership of his country, both before and following independence in 1991.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">The people of Turkmenistan have a long history, a proud culture and great economic potential. In recent years Turkmenistan has sought to play a role in the promotion of stability in its region of Central Asia, including through its policy of permanent neutrality. It is an active member of the international community in such key institutions as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. As the Secretary-General has recalled, Turkmenistan has made important contributions to the United Nations peace processes in Tajikistan and Afghanistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">We hope that, once their period of mourning is over, the people of Turkmenistan will find renewed opportunities to pursue their road to development in freedom, peace and the rule of law, thereby contributing also to the further promotion of security and stability in their region and beyond.</p>

Mr. Niyazov will remain in our memory as an eminent political leader and statesman, and as a man with unwavering vital energy and tireless optimism.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">President Niyazov played a key role in establishing and strengthening the statehood of an independent Turkmenistan and in developing the country's economic potential. His policy of neutrality helped to determine Turkmenistan's place in the contemporary system of international relations and his country's involvement in international economic relations, as well as in establishing multilateral cooperation based on the principles of mutual security and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">Turkmenistan and the States of CIS are linked by a common history and cultures, as well as by political and economic interests.

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Ataeva</span> <span class="nation">Turkmenistan</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa01">First of all, on behalf of the Government and the people of Turkmenistan, I would like to express our deep appreciation to the Chairpersons of the regional groups, Permanent Representatives of United Nations Member States and heads of missions of international organizations to the United Nations for the words of condolence they have addressed to the people of Turkmenistan and to my country's Government at this difficult time. We deeply appreciate the support and solidarity of the international community. I am grateful to everyone gathered today in this Hall to share our grief and pain.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa02">The people of Turkmenistan have suffered a great loss. On 21 December at 1.10 a.m., cardiac arrest quickly resulted in the death of Saparmurat Niyazov, President of Turkmenistan. Mr. Niyazov was the leader of Turkmenistan for 21 years. Our people's new era -- one of reborn statehood -- is inextricably associated with our leader. A true leader, President Niyazov was able to carry out our ancestors age-old dream of establishing a united and independent State.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa03">In heading the country and determining the true role of the Turkmen people in world history, President Niyazov ensured that the entire world knew of the heroism of our ancestors and the contribution of the people of Turkmenistan to the development of world civilization. The glorious years during which Mr. Niyazov led our country confirmed his gift of vision and skill in determining true priorities, his uncommon abilities in leading a State and people and his talent as a diplomat and wise and humane person.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa04">Once Turkmenistan achieved independence, Mr. Niyazov developed the major principles upon which to build our State. The thoughtful and consistent domestic and foreign policy of Saparmurat Niyazov ensured that we would have the major conditions and opportunities for the successful development of an independent State. The goals he set epitomized the interests of the people. Our major accomplishments were in keeping with the spirit of the people, and were heartily embraced by every citizen of Turkmenistan. Mr. Niyazov restored and successfully developed the nearly moribund spiritual and cultural life of our people, of which we are so proud: its glorious history, its priceless literary heritage, its ancient mother tongue and its illustrious ceremonies and traditions.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa05">Mr. Niyazov was equally respectful of the representatives of all nations and peoples living in Turkmenistan. He affirmed in the country the principles of unity, solidarity and mutual trust. He raised human dignity in Turkmenistan to a high level and was a major treasure of our society.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa06">Under his leadership, we accomplished a tremendous amount with regard to our economy and raised the standard of living of our people. As a result of Turkmenistan's peaceful relations with States throughout the world, we were able to gain a place of authority in the international arena. Through the initiative and leadership of President Niyazov, Turkmenistan declared and carried out a foreign policy of permanent neutrality, which was recognized by the international community through the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-50-80.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 50/80</a> A on 12 December 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa07">President Niyazov made an outstanding contribution to the achievement and strengthening of peace, security and stability in the Central Asian region. Through his initiative, and in close cooperation with the United Nations, several rounds of negotiations were held in Turkmenistan in 1995 and 1996 that made it possible to reach a peace settlement to the civil conflict in Tajikistan. President Niyazov made a tremendous personal contribution in organizing and carrying out in Turkmenistan, under the auspices of the United Nations, direct talks between the warring parties to the conflict in Afghanistan. Subsequently, through his decision, Turkmenistan made available its territory and infrastructure, as well as the necessary technical and logistical support, for the transport of international humanitarian cargo to the Afghan people. That continues today.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa08">At this difficult time, the people of Turkmenistan, being committed to the principles of Turkmen national statehood established by President Niyazov as the foundation of an independent State, will continue to follow the political course of our leader. Our country's domestic and foreign policy will remain intact, based on the principles of peace, humanism and justice. Turkmenistan will also continue to follow its policy of neutrality based on good-neighbourly relations, mutual respect, equality and mutually beneficial cooperation with all State around the world, while at the same time fully meeting its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations through bilateral and multilateral agreements, treaties and conventions to which we are a party.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk07-pa09">The Turkmen people's faith in  and love for President Niyazov is limitless and unchanging. The people of Turkmenistan wholeheartedly live by the vows of our leader. We will be dedicated to him and to what he has done as a great man. We shall continue what he has begun.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Sulaiti</span> <span class="nation">Qatar</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01">I have the honour to report to the General Assembly on the successful outcome of the Sixth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, which was organized by the Government of the State of Qatar from 29 October to 1 November 2006, in cooperation with the United Nations. More than 100 Member States participated in the Conference, together with parliamentarians representing 69 countries and representatives of 100 civil society organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa02">I now have the honour to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.51.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.51</a>, entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies". Let me express the deep appreciation and profound gratitude of the Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, President of the General Assembly, whose distinguished presence, active participation, warm friendship and effective support at the Doha Conference enriched and added depth to its deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa03">The International Conferences of New or Restored Democracies began a distinct movement to promote democratic values, stimulate a new brand of international cooperation in favour of democratization. They bring a new focus to the international development agenda. The previous five important International Conferences were held in Manila, Philippines; Managua, Nicaragua; Bucharest, Romania; Cotonou, Benin; and Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa04">The Sixth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies reaffirmed the core principles and values of democracy and offered new perspectives and dimensions regarding the need to promote, preserve and consolidate the democratization process throughout the world. The Conference had two main objectives: to enhance the linkages among democracy, peace and social progress on the global development agenda and to initiate systematic implementation and follow-up measures to consolidate the achievements and recommendations resulting from the previous important International Conferences of New or Restored Democracies, the first of which was held in 1988.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa05">A major feature of the Sixth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies was its interactive dialogues, round tables and forums, which brought together Government representatives, parliamentarians and representatives of civil society organizations. The Conference had three substantive outcomes: the Doha Declaration, adopted by the Governments; a Joint Statement of Government representatives, parliamentarians and representatives of civil society; and a final report to be prepared by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa06">The Doha Declaration reaffirmed the resolve of numerous United Nations Member States to adhere to universally relevant democratic values, principles and standards. It also reflected the support of concerned member States of the Conference for the establishment of follow-up steps to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the International Conference movement. The Doha Declaration requested the Chair of the Sixth International Conference to take the necessary measures to guarantee appropriate implementation and follow-up of the recommendations of the International Conferences, with the assistance of an advisory board, over a three-year period.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa07">The Joint Statement of Government representatives, parliamentarians and representatives of civil society organizations announced the commitment to cooperate and build effective partnerships among those three prominent groups in pursuit of core democratic values and principles. The Joint Statement welcomed the Doha Declaration and called for the establishment of a democracy advisory commission and an international steering committee to implement the recommendations of the Parliamentary Forum and the Civil Society Forum, respectively. The final report of the Conference is being prepared in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme and the Department of Political Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa08">The Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar to the United Nations recently submitted several communications to the Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly and all Permanent Missions to the United Nations. On 14 November 2006, the Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar sent a letter to the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/A-61-581.pdf" class="pdf">A/61/581</a>) transmitting the Doha Declaration and the Joint Statement. On 16 November 2006, the Permanent Mission sent a letter to the President of the General Assembly (<a href="../pdf/A-61-235.pdf" class="pdf">A/61/235</a>) requesting the inclusion of an additional item in the agenda of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. That request was approved with the addition of agenda item 157, entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies". Finally, the text of a draft resolution was transmitted on 29 November 2006 to all Permanent Missions, and several informal consultations were held earlier this month with many Permanent Missions. We are grateful to our partners for their support.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa09">The draft resolution before members today, entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies", draws on agreed language, particularly from <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-253.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolutions 60/253</a>, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-58-13.pdf" class="pdf">58/13</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-58-281.pdf" class="pdf">58/281</a>. The draft resolution has four objectives: to provide information about the concrete outcomes of the Sixth International Conference, that is, the Doha Declaration and the Joint Statement; to emphasize the close cooperation in that regard between the United Nations and Governments, as well as among parliaments, civil society and Governments; to highlight the special focus of the Sixth International Conference, which was the need for systematic implementation of the recommendations of the International Conferences; and to request the Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session a summary of the outcomes of the Sixth International Conference under the item entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies".</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa10">The Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar would like to express its deep appreciation and gratitude to all those Governments that participated in the Doha Conference and to those who cooperated with us in preparing the draft resolution. I should like to announce that, since the introduction of the draft resolution, the following countries have joined the list of sponsors: Albania, Andorra, Angola, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, the Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Maldives, Mali, Malta, the Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Mongolia, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Senegal, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Republic of Tanzania.

We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to the Government of Qatar and its delegation for hosting the Sixth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies in Doha last month and for its efforts to take the initiative on this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk06-pa02">Japan attaches great importance to democracy as a universal value, along with fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and human rights, which are the basis for the realization of happiness and the prosperity of each individual. We consider that the consolidation and strengthening of democratic institutions will lead to the establishment of peaceful and prosperous societies and, in turn, will contribute to the peace and stability of the whole world.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk06-pa03">Last month, our Foreign Minister, Taro Aso, made a speech entitled "Arc of freedom and prosperity: Japan's expanding diplomatic horizons", in which he stressed the importance, as we advance our diplomatic endeavours, of universal values such as democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law and the market economy.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk06-pa04">In the resolution just adopted, the General Assembly urges the Secretary-General to continue to improve the capacity of the Organization to respond effectively to the requests of Member States by providing adequate support for their efforts to achieve the goals of good governance and democratization, including through the activities of the Democracy Fund at the United Nations. My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to announce that the Government of Japan has decided to make a contribution to the Democracy Fund in the amount of $10 million.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk06-pa05">Japan sincerely hopes that this assistance through the United Nations to those countries that wish to promote and consolidate their democracies will contribute to the realization of a more peaceful and prosperous world.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">My country joined the consensus on the item entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies", based on our participation in many conferences and activities relating to the draft resolution just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">First among them was the Forum on Emerging Democracies, held in Sana'a in 1999, with the participation of a number of young or emerging democracies from Asia, Africa and Latin America, other Governments, several international and regional organizations, including the United Nations, and representatives of civil society. The Forum was the first of its kind and resulted in the Sana'a Declaration. The General Assembly took note of the Forum in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-96.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/96</a> of 4 December 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The Sana'a Declaration included a number of important recommendations for strengthening democracy, particularly in developing countries. Most unfortunately, however, the resolution just adopted makes no reference to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-96.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/96</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa02">The Secretary-General reports that up to 3 billion people in 107 countries and territories are affected by malaria. While most of the burden is on Africa, malaria is a global problem continuing to hinder social and economic development in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe and the Pacific.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa03">Each year, more than 500 million people suffer from acute malaria, which causes more than 1 million deaths, at least 86 per of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria is, however, is a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable. It is thus in an effort to roll back malaria, as well as to implement Millennium Development Goal 6, that the African Union is again this year presenting a draft resolution entitled "2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa".</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa04">The draft resolution is an update of a similar resolution that was adopted last year. The draft resolution has been updated to take into account new developments and measures to combat malaria, especially those relating to issues concerning vector control, protection and treatment for children and pregnant women, increased access to affordable medicine, increased investment in and efforts aimed at research and development, transfers of technology and private sector contributions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk04-pa05">My delegation would like to thank all of the delegations that participated in negotiations on the draft resolution. Their constructive contributions enabled us to get a text that will provide a framework for action by all stakeholders in the fight to eradicate malaria.

On behalf of the General Assembly, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to both of them for their able leadership. I am sure that members of the Assembly join me in extending to them our sincere appreciation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Afifi</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk06-pa01">I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the members of the joint group of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and China. This statement pertains to the adoption of the draft decision entitled "Mandate review".</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk06-pa02">Allow me, at the outset, on behalf of the members of the joint group of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and China, to express our gratitude for the tireless and successful efforts you are exerting, Madam President, to facilitate the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk06-pa03">In the context of our decision today relating to extending the process of mandate review to the end of the Assembly's current session, the joint group would like to reiterate its firm position, which it has held since the beginning of the process. We believe that mandate review is a unique opportunity to strengthen the United Nations and to increase its effectiveness. In that context, the members of the group expressed their willingness to become engaged in the process of reviewing mandates older than five years and not renewed, in order to address some of the waste and redundancy that permeate the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk06-pa04">After concluding this phase, during which the group played a leading and constructive role, the group agreed to become engaged in the second phase of the process, which is to renew mandates older than five years but which have been renewed, in a spirit of flexibility and responsibility with a view to realizing the aims and objectives of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk06-pa05">However, the members of the group affirmed, in the context of the informal plenary meeting held on 24 November 2006, that their engagement in this phase of the process will be governed by certain guidelines; this which was not contested by any of the other groups or Member States. Those guidelines, which will still govern the engagement of the group of the process until the end of the sixty-first session, are as follows.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk06-pa06">First, the exercise shall be undertaken in a transparent, open and all-inclusive manner that respects the equality of Member States, as enshrined in the Charter. Second, the objective of the exercise is to strengthen the programme of work of the Organization, including through providing additional financial and human resources if required. Third, the mandate review is not a cost-cutting exercise and does not aim at reducing the budget levels of the Organization. Fourth, all decisions pertaining to this exercise shall be based primarily on the principle of consensus, without prejudice to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly concerning decision-making. Fifth, politically sensitive mandates -- which include mandates in the areas of the maintenance of international peace and security, development and other categories -- fall outside the scope of this exercise, and no mandate shall be discontinued except with the consent of parties concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk06-pa07">Sixth, the scope of the exercise is limited to mandates older than five years at the date of the adoption of the World Summit Outcome, in September 2005. Seventh, any resources that might be freed up from the review of mandates shall be redirected to the same issue area, unless otherwise agreed by Member States. Eighth, the informal working group at the expert level shall be the appropriate mechanism to undertake the substantive review of mandates, and it shall submit a report to the informal working group of the plenary. In undertaking this task, the expert-level working group shall entrust the Main Committees of the Assembly with a substantive review of mandates that fall within the respective purview of each Main Committee.</p>

Indeed, United Kingdom delegations to a number of recent meetings, including those of the Beijing Plus Ten review and the Commission on Sustainable Development, have included representatives from ECLAC associate members. However, the United Kingdom believes that the participation of ECLAC associate members should be through the official delegations of United Nations Member States, rather than as separate entities. The United Kingdom continues to interpret ECLAC resolution 574 (XXVII) in that way.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Miller</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">The United States voted against <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-231.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/231</a>. We agree in principle that United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies can usefully provide support to territories that are not United Nations Members, so long as the domestic laws and policies of a territory's administering Power allows such United Nations support.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">However, the United States considers that it is inappropriate to link the work of specialized agencies to the Declaration or to the issue of colonial peoples. The United States objects in particular to provisions in the resolution that make recommendations with respect to the participation of territories in the activities and bodies of the United Nations. It is the responsibility of the administering Power, not the General Assembly or the Economic and Social Council, to decide the nature, if any, of its territory's participation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Under the United States Constitution, the federal Government has the sole responsibility for the conduct of United States foreign relations, and that includes foreign relations that relate to United States territories. These arrangements have been accepted by such territories.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">For the United States, the very term "non-self-governing" seems inappropriate for territories able to establish their own constitution, elect their own public officers, have representation in Washington, D.C., and choose their own economic path. The United States was fully supportive when countries chose independence, and was proud to welcome them as equal and sovereign partners. In the case of territories that did not choose independence, however, the United States has also supported the right of people in those territories to a full measure of self-government, including the rights to integration and free association. The United States calls upon all Member States to respect the choices made by residents of non-self-governing territories.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">Finally, the United States would like to point out that by including paragraph 13, the sponsors of the resolution ignored decisions made by the Economic and Social Council, a principal organ of the United Nations, and its subsidiary body, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, since those United Nations bodies declined to adopt the resolution noted in that paragraph, for many of the reasons we have already mentioned.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Grönberg</span> <span class="nation">Finland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk21-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk21-pa02">The European Union is a staunch supporter of the United Nations and the ideals and principles it stands for. The European Union also supports the consensus principle, which is fundamental for our decisions on budgetary matters in the Fifth Committee. It is with that in mind that the European Union joined the consensus on the scale of assessments.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk21-pa03">At the same time, however, it should be clear to all that the European Union proposed changes to the methodology. In our opinion, there are better, fairer and more balanced ways to share the budgetary responsibilities of the United Nations among all Member States. The status quo is not sustainable in the long term.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk21-pa04">We went into the negotiations with an open mind, looking forward to a debate. We recognize that we were not able to convince others to take our concerns into account. With this in mind, the General Assembly has now requested the Committee on Contributions to review the matter and to present us with alternatives for the methodology, reflecting capacity to pay.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk21-pa05">As the role of the United Nations in the world has been growing in recent years, the budget of the United Nations has likewise increased and seems likely to continue to do so. The European Union, as the largest contributor of resources, has great interest in ensuring that resources are spent in an efficient, effective and transparent way. In this regard, we will continue to fully support efforts by the Secretary-General to improve the functioning of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk21-pa06">The growing budget also makes the United Nations more dependent on timely payment of contributions. The European Union has consistently shown its responsibility in this regard, and we once again appeal to all Member States to do the same: to pay in full, on time and without conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk21-pa07">We wish to extend our thanks to all of our partners. While sometimes adversaries in negotiations, we all share a concern for the future of this planet. By achieving agreement today, we have made it possible for this one global body -- a body that we, as the European Union, consider so special and important -- to continue operating. For that we are grateful, and we would like to wish all delegations all the best for the holiday season.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Lock</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of 77 and China on agenda item 122, entitled "Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations".</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">By adopting <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-237.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/237</a>, on the scale of assessments for the period 2007 to 2009, the Assembly has reaffirmed that the principle of capacity to pay remains the fundamental criterion in determining how the expenses of the Organization should be apportioned among its Member States. The Group of 77 and China joins this consensus and remains ready to ensure that the Organization receives adequate and predictable financing in order to successfully implement the numerous mandates that Member States have bestowed upon it. The final outcome does not reflect some of the concerns of developing countries, but we believe that it is a good outcome for the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">The Group of 77 and China wishes to thank the coordinator, Mr. Seyed Morteza Mirmohammad, for the manner in which he guided the members of the Fifth Committee during the negotiations. We furthermore wish to thank our negotiating partners for the constructive manner in which the negotiations were conducted. The Group also appreciates the invaluable assistance that the Fifth Committee received from the Chairman of the Committee on Contributions and the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">The negotiations on the scale of assessments are traditionally challenging, and Member States were at times faced with very difficult decisions. The Group of 77 and China, however, is encouraged that the negotiations were transparent and conducted in a spirit of compromise, and that all the negotiating groups and delegations showed good faith throughout. That enabled the Committee to arrive at a consensus decision. We also appreciate the invaluable support provided by you, Madam President, and your Office during the negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">Turning to the resolution, the Group of 77 and China welcomes the reaffirmation in the resolution that the determination of the scale of assessments shall remain the prerogative of the General Assembly. The resolution further reaffirms that the Committee on Contributions is a technical body and that, in its consideration of the elements of future methodologies, it should be guided by relevant General Assembly resolutions and the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. We also welcome the reaffirmation that the scale of assessments should continue to reflect the fundamental principle of capacity to pay. To this end, we wish to state our position on a number of fundamental principles relating to the elements of the methodology of the scale of assessments.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">First, the Group of 77 and China holds the view that the main element affecting and distorting the application of the principle of capacity to pay is the ceiling. That is contrary to the intention of the General Assembly when it agreed to set a maximum assessment rate for the main contributor: that the application of the ceiling should not distort the principle of capacity to pay. It also places an unfair burden on the rest of the membership.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">It will be recalled that, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-5.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 55/5</a> C, the rationale for reducing the ceiling to 22 per cent was to facilitate the payment of contributions and arrears by the main contributor and thereby improve the financial situation of the United Nations. The consensus decision in 2000 was based on the understanding that the rationale for requesting the reduction would be honoured. The Group of 77 and China believes that the compact arrived at in 2000 remains to be honoured by the main contributor and that it thus would be incumbent upon the General Assembly to continue to undertake the review decided on in paragraph 2 of its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-5.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/5</a> C. Despite our opposition to unilateral attempts to artificially reduce the ceiling, the Group of 77 and China, in 2000, and once again now in 2006, joined the consensus for the sake of the financial well-being of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">Secondly, the Group of 77 and China wishes to emphasize that the low per capita income adjustment is an integral part of the scale methodology used by the Organization since its creation in 1948. We strongly support maintaining it as a fundamental element of the methodology and will continue to oppose any attempts to undermine the principle and application of this adjustment. The General Assembly from the beginning has recognized that the comparative income per head of population should be taken into account in order to prevent anomalous assessments resulting from the use of comparative estimates of national income. Therefore, the Group opposed attempts to introduce a multiple gradient thereby applying a different criterion to some developing countries by ignoring the impact that large populations place on the capacity of developing countries to pay. We will continue to oppose attempts to shift the burden resulting from the reduction of the ceiling to developing countries. The proposal for a multiple gradient was not fair and undermined the principle of capacity to pay.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">Thirdly, the Group of 77 and China maintains the position that the debt burden adjustment reflects an important factor in the capacity to pay of Member States and should be maintained as an integral element of the scale methodology based on the debt stock approach. We were concerned by the attempts of developed countries in this negotiation to eliminate the debt burden adjustment. We wish to place on record that we will not support any attempts to undermine or change this crucial element of the methodology.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">The Group of 77 and China was concerned that, once again, a number of Member States faced substantial increases in their rates of assessment. We consequently submitted a concrete proposal for a phasing-in mechanism that was aimed at finding a technical solution to this recurring and endemic problem. Whilst we appreciate the positive response that our proposal received from some delegations, it is regrettable that it was not included in the final consensus outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">This difficulty was finally resolved through the redistribution of points received from the Russian Federation and mitigation provided by other developing countries in the Group of 77 and China. We appreciate the gesture by the Russian Federation and by other developing countries to assist in mitigation.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa12">However, the Group expects that the Committee on Contributions will focus on this question and make proposals to address such increases through a phasing-in mechanism in order not to impose an excessive burden on Member States, particularly developing countries, facing large increases in their rates of assessment.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa13">As we are nearing the end of this session, I have the honour to convey to you, Madam President, the gratitude of the Group of 77 and China for your guidance and able leadership. You have steered us through very difficult times and instilled a sense of transparency in our deliberations. We also wish to pay tribute to the States members of the Group of 77 and China for their unity and support to South Africa during our chairmanship. In the face of attempts to divide developing countries, we were heartened by the solidarity and commitment of the Group to this Organization.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Roth</span> <span class="nation">Liechtenstein</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">Under the terms of the new scale of assessments, Liechtenstein's contribution to the United Nations budget will increase by 66 per cent, attaining a rate of assessment of 0.01 per cent. This rate had already been apportioned to Liechtenstein before the year 2000. In 2000, the then-new machine scale triggered a decrease in Liechtenstein's rates of assessment for the following years. Although Liechtenstein considered this rate as not accurately reflecting its capacity to pay, we accepted the new scale but at the same time reaffirmed our expectation to be assessed at a higher percentage. Since then, Liechtenstein has been paying the difference between the former rate of 0.01 per cent and the subsequent rates of 0.005 and 0.006 per cent in the form of voluntary contributions to various United nations entities and activities, focusing on programmes funded from voluntary contributions that we believe should be funded from the regular budget.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">We are pleased to see that for the period 2007-2009, Liechtenstein's rate has attained the level we have always considered to be appropriate. The reason for this increase does not lie in the methodology used, but in the availability of previously unavailable official figures, which replaced the formerly used United Nations Statistics Division estimates. Given this situation, Liechtenstein will cease to make the aforementioned kind of additional contributions. However, Liechtenstein will continue to make other kinds of voluntary contributions.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Simancas</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">My delegation joined the consensus with respect to continuing to use the current methodology for setting the scale of assessments, owing to Mexico's commitment to ensuring that the work of the United Nations continues to move forward.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">As members know, Mexico proposed a methodology for determining the scale of assessments for States Members of the Organization. Given the shortcomings that continue to exist in the current system, my country hopes that, in the future, Mexico's proposal will be taken into consideration. Among other advantages, that formula would offset distortions that primarily affect developing countries, because it takes into account the differences that exist in the national income levels of Member States, within the parameters that the membership has agreed upon.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">In the broader context of our discussions, we have repeatedly asked that the United Nations be brought up to date and that it reflect the realities of today's world. This needs to apply also to the issue of the scale of assessment. Contributions need to be an accurate reflection of the involvement of each Member State in the global context.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">With the approval of the scale of assessments for the three-year period 2007-2009, Mexico has consolidated its position as the tenth largest contributor worldwide. In addition, Mexico's assessment is the largest in Latin America and the Caribbean: our assessment is more than half of the total contribution from our region.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">We believe it relevant to point that out in order to underscore my country's great interest in ensuring that the programmes of the United Nations system conform to clearly defined priorities and to evident and clear functionality in terms of its tasks, with transparency in the use of financial resources, and that proposals with an impact on the budget of the Organization be formulated with due thoroughness and responsibility.</p>

	<p id="pg023-bk05-pa01">The Russian delegation would like to state the following with regard to the General Assembly's adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-244.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/244</a>, entitled "Human resources management".</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk05-pa02">We believe that the General Assembly has been able to agree on a generally balanced resolution that takes a constructive approach to reform in the area of human resources, thereby contributing to strengthening the management system at the United Nations in general. However, we would like to express our disappointment that the resolution does not include provisions on issues related to cases of waiving immunity for United Nations officials other than Secretariat staff. We would like to confirm that the Russian delegation believes that in cases that have arisen with regard to waiving immunity for that category of officials, the Secretary-General disregarded procedures established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-280.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 56/280</a>, which set forth a mechanism for consultations between the Secretary-General and the General Assembly on issues related to waiving immunity for elected officials.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk05-pa03">We are also very surprised that certain delegations have prevented the Assembly from receiving information from the Secretary-General on issues related to waiving immunity for elected United Nations officials. We believe that such an approach sets a negative precedent for the Assembly's future work. The effectiveness of its work, including on issues relating to management and organization, depends greatly on the ability of delegations to receive full information about the work of the Secretariat and about its compliance with established procedures. That information is necessary for Member States to take well-considered decisions. We are certain that proposals of delegations need to be considered conscientiously.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk05-pa04">We also believe that it is incorrect to prevent the General Assembly from considering issues that fall within its purview on the pretext that doing so may have an impact on the work of judiciary bodies of Member States. Such an approach could greatly complicate the decision-making process in the General Assembly and set a negative precedent for the future.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk05-pa05">We anticipate that the Secretary-General will shed full light on issues pertaining to immunity in his report on the application of the regulations governing the status, basic rights and duties of officials other than Secretariat officials, which the General Assembly has once again requested.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk05-pa06">We would like to note that we will continue to raise issues relating to immunity for elected United Nations officials in the future, as well as to discuss those matters in the General Assembly.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk16">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Elji</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa01">My delegation wishes to explain its position on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-252.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/252</a>, just adopted, and particularly on part VII thereof.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa02">At the outset, I should like to express my delegation's support for the General Assembly's adoption of the resolution to finance special political missions, promoting the United Nations role in the good offices missions provided for in the Charter. We also express our satisfaction at the General Assembly's recognition of the concerns that my delegation voiced in its statement before the Fifth Committee on 18 December during the discussion of agenda item 117, entitled "Programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007", on the mandate of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the Implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council Resolution 1559 (2004)</a> in the logical framework of the budget. At that time, my delegation expressed concerns and reservations concerning the logical framework of the budget of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for several reasons.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa03">First, the logical framework for the mission, which was not endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution, expands the mandate of the Special Envoy for the Implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council Resolution 1559 (2004)</a> to include some of the requests set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)</a>. Such an expansion of mandates would lead not only to the duplication of work in the Secretariat, as there is another Special Envoy of the Secretary-General concerned with the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1701 (2006)</a>, but also to interpreting <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1701 (2006)</a> outside its context and substance and to an end other than that for which it was adopted, which is to end Israeli aggression against Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa04">Secondly, the logical framework set out for some indicators of achievement exceeds the role of the Secretariat in good offices, contrary to the commitments provided for in the United Nations Charter, particularly paragraph 7 of Article 2 prohibiting any intervention by the United Nations in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State. The issues of diplomatic relations and the delineation of borders between any two countries are related to national sovereignty and fall outside the framework of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a> and of the mandate of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa05">Thirdly, it is difficult to understand why the logical framework should ignore Israel's ongoing occupation of parts of southern Lebanon, its continued breaches of Lebanese airspace, and its threat to United Nations forces in southern Lebanon, all of which pose a genuine danger to Lebanon's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. In other words, Israel continues to act in violation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a>. Instead, the logical framework focuses on premeditated and erroneous interpretations made by the Secretary-General's Special Envoy to distract attention from Israel's failure to comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa06">Moreover, although <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a> provides for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the Secretariat neglected to cite that as an expected accomplishment. That represents a very odd disregard of the continued presence of Israeli forces on Lebanese territory. Indeed, they are present there in several places at this very moment. That demonstrates the bias and lack of neutrality in the logical framework of that part of the budget.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa07">We welcome the General Assembly's recognition of the concerns expressed by my delegation and its call on the Secretary-General to review all special political missions. In that respect, I note in particular the budget of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the Implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council Resolution 1559 (2004)</a>. We also stress the General Assembly's adoption of a review of the logical framework to ensure that programmatic aspects and resource requirements are in line with legislative mandates. We look forward to receiving the report on that review requested by the General Assembly from the Secretary-General as soon as possible, and no later than the second resumed session. We believe that such is the understanding reached this evening.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa08">In that regard, we expect the Secretariat to take the concerns I have just expressed seriously in its preparation of the revised logical framework and the proposed budget for special political missions. In that respect, my delegation also notes that the General Assembly has reduced the budget proposed by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, as it was not convinced by the justifications put forward regarding resources, including those related to financing the budget of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the Implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council Resolution 1559 (2004)</a>. That is a fundamental issue around which a strong negotiating position emerged in support of our view.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa09">We welcome the emphasis which the resolution places on the need to respect the provisions of paragraph 9 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-231.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/231</a>, in which the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that expected accomplishments and, where possible, indicators of achievement were included to measure achievements in the implementation of the programmes of the Organization and not those of individual Member States. We note the General Assembly's request to the Secretary-General that he submit his future budget proposals in full compliance with its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-231.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 55/231</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk16-pa10">In conclusion, allow me to stress the substance of paragraph 5 of part VII of the resolution, which underlines the continued importance of the Secretary-General's ensuring, when appointing his Special Representatives and Envoys, the highest standards of integrity, competency, impartiality and professionalism. We are convinced that the Secretary-General Designate will rely fully on those guidelines in appointing all his new special envoys and representatives.</p>

	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa02">We wish to underscore the great importance we attach to all 27 special political missions. We would therefore like to make clear our understanding of how the adjustments in resource levels agreed in the resolution will be applied within part III of the budget. We understand, and heard several delegations in the formal meeting of the Fifth Committee confirm, that those would be applied in accordance with the recommendations set out in paragraph 91 of the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) and as clarified by the ACABQ Chairman when he introduced his report in a formal meeting of the Fifth Committee.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa01">This is the final plenary meeting of the main part of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. It has been an honour for me to preside over this busy and productive period during the past few months.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa02">The plenary met 84 times and the General Committee five times, and there were 20 informal consultations. We adopted 254 resolutions. We also held four meetings of the tenth emergency special session.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa03">I would like to thank the Chairpersons of the Main Committees for the leadership they have shown, which has enabled us to conclude our busy schedule in an efficient and timely manner. I wish also to extend my sincere appreciation to the Vice-Presidents and to the Bureaux of the six Main Committees for supporting the Assembly's work.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa04">As I noted in my opening statement at the 1st meeting of the session, we are an organization of hope based upon commitment, consensus and co-existence. We all have a stake in achieving a safer and fairer world. It is only by working together to address the many challenges our world is facing that we can make such an achievement a reality.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa05">During this part of the session, I have worked with Member States and Secretary-General Kofi Annan to build bridges and trust. I intend to continue to do the same when Secretary-General-designate Ban Ki-moon takes office in the New Year.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa06">The Assembly has shown that when we are united in partnership and when we overcome mistrust, we can achieve much more for each other. The adoption of the resolution on strengthening Economic and Social Council is a good example of this fact.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa07">We have also made progress in many other areas of our common agenda. We had important debates on Security Council reform and General Assembly revitalization. We adopted two important international conventions, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa08">During this important and busy transition phase, we were also able to finalize the appointment of the Secretary-General-designate, Ban Ki-moon and to pay tribute to the successful tenure of Secretary-General Kofi Annan and bid him farewell.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa09">I was encouraged by the constructive spirit that prevailed during the debate on Security Council reform. And I believe that there is clearly a growing desire to establish a credible process for achieving a meaningful outcome in this outstanding area of reform. Although some differences remain, I believe that in the New Year we will be able to look at this matter in a fresh light.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa10">We also had a successful debate on the revitalization of the General Assembly. Many members noted that we should become more focused on strategic issues and more action-oriented so that our work would have greater visibility and impact.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa11">The informal thematic debate on development was an example of the General Assembly increasing its visibility. We broadened our discussions to involve the private sector and civil society. The Islamic Development Bank announced the creation of a $10 billion poverty eradication fund, to which even the poorest developing countries will contribute.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa12">We have made progress on Secretariat and management reform and worked hard to obtain a satisfactory conclusion to the debate on a new scale of assessments. In addition, work on the renovation of the United Nations Headquarters in New York will soon commence with the adoption of the resolution on the capital master plan.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa13">Working together, we have built confidence among Member States in order to make good progress in the mandate review exercise, which has now been extended until the end of the sixty-first session.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa14">We have also established a process on environmental governance in order to reach agreement on steps to enable the United Nations system to have a more effective impact on environmental issues.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa15">I hope that, building on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, we can fully implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and in the New Year reach consensus on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa16">Promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women is an integral aspect of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In March next year, the General Assembly will hold its second informal thematic debate on the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women, in order to help make such equality and empowerment a reality. A successful outcome will again demonstrate that the General Assembly can have an impact on the issues that really count.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa17">While the forces of globalization and mass communication have brought us closer together, they have also made us more aware of our cultural differences. In order to promote greater dialogue and tolerance among civilizations and cultures, I intend to convene a third informal interactive thematic debate in the summer of 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa18">We have many important matters of common concern that require our close attention when we return. I hope that we can begin the New Year by working even more closely together in a spirit of cooperation, mutual trust and collective responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk12-pa19">Finally, I would also like to commend the dedication and commitment of all the staff working in the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management, the interpreters and everyone else working behinds the scenes to ensure that our work runs smoothly. I thank them once again for all their support and hard work, and wish them all a very happy holiday.</p>
