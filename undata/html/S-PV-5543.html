<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Nasser</span> <span class="nation">Qatar</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">As your presidency approaches its end, Sir, allow me to congratulate you on the great job that you and the members of your delegation have accomplished. The day has been very busy with important activities for the Council, and before we finish with the last item on today's agenda, my delegation should like to commend you on the great flexibility you have demonstrated in maintaining the Council's unity and credibility.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">I have been most pleased to participate actively with the other members of the Council and to speak repeatedly in the meetings of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1591(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1591 (2005)</a> concerning the Sudan. Most importantly, we have repeatedly advised the Panel of Experts and the Committee members to be precise, cautious and professional in addressing the issue of Darfur and its implications for the Sudan as a whole, its people and Government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">In the course of several consultations, we expressed our concern as the Panel of Experts hastened to hurl allegations and accusations against individuals, without regard for a number of essential principles. Among these is not to encroach on the jurisdiction of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court with respect to Darfur and not to disregard the results of the investigation. They even went so far as to level accusations at high officials of a sovereign nation without taking sound legal principles into consideration and without respect for protocol. In dealing with the issue, of Darfur, the Panel of Experts has treated as equals the Government of National Unity -- the legitimate Government of the Sudan -- and the rebel groups that are hindering the peace process and ignoring the calls of the international community to negotiate and join the agreement, along with a number of other matters that had previously been brought to the attention of the Panel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">The Panel, however, has disregarded our concerns and continued to work in a manner that can hardly be described as professional.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa05">My delegation respects the technical procedures of the 1591 Committee in reporting and making recommendations to the Security Council after reaching consensus. We would not wish to undermine the work of the Committee or the utility of its work. Given the fact that the Panel of Experts is an independent body assisting the Committee and must be neutral, transparent and independent of all political influence, my delegation would send the message that the Panel's aberrations can be corrected in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa06">It is our hope that all groups of experts working with the sanctions Committee should do so accurately, professionally, transparently and non-selectively so as to maintain the Security Council's credibility before all humanity. In view of the foregoing, my delegation intends to continue its cooperation and to vote in favour of the draft resolution before us in the hope that the Panel of Experts will reform its working methods and work in transparency and professionalism in the future.</p>
