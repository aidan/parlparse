	Mr. Carp (United States)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The United States joined consensus on this draft resolution because we feel that, through negotiations, we were able to reach understanding with other Member States on a number of issues that are of fundamental importance to us. This draft resolution points out that stable and accountable governance is essential for economic development, and it recognizes the importance of private capital, particularly foreign direct investment, in development financing.</div>
	<div class="p">But most important, it acknowledges the independent mandates of the Bretton Woods institutions. That is a critical issue for us because, very frankly, we were unable to join consensus on the draft resolution on this item last year primarily due to concerns that the draft resolution sought to impose prescriptions on the international financial institutions in a way that interfered with their autonomy in organization, operation and decision-making.</div>
	<div class="p">After lengthy and frank negotiations, we believe that this year's draft resolution shows clear acceptance of the division of labour between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. The United Nations, as a political organization of the international community, represents the political views of its Members. The Bretton Woods institutions, as separate financial institutions with their own charters and mandates, enjoy organizational and decision-making independence in dealing with world financial matters.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe it is essential that the full independence of the international financial institutions be completely respected and upheld, especially in a number of areas mentioned in the draft resolution. These include, but are not limited to, such areas of concern as the suggestion of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies, as well as the consideration of the consolidation of a broader global agenda regarding the international financial system. In addition, we believe that it is critical that regional cooperation should support, not supplant, the global efforts of the international financial institutions.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community recognizes the need to strengthen the international financial system. Experience has shown that international financial institutions are the most effective actors to help achieve that goal. Their independence, as well as their technical expertise and focus, are crucial to their credibility, and therefore to the success of their work. We fully expect that the international community will do everything it can to protect this credibility.</div>

	Mr. Mbanefo (Nigeria)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I wish to speak in explanation of action to be taken regarding the report of the Second Committee (<a href="../pdf/A-55-584">A/55/584</a>) on agenda item 97, entitled "Training and research".</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to refer to draft resolution III, entitled "United Nations Institute for Training and Research" (UNITAR), in particular operative paragraph 13 thereof, as recommended by the Second Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">The understanding of the Group of 77 during the negotiations was that the reclassification of the rental rates and maintenance costs sought in paragraph 13 for UNITAR would somewhat improve the current financial status of the Institute, at least in the short term, until the issue of rent and maintenance costs paid by UNITAR can be reviewed next year.</div>
	<div class="p">Indeed, as operative paragraphs 7 and 8, as well as preambular paragraph 7, made clear, the need for such review has become obvious and necessary, not only to ensure that UNITAR enjoys parity of treatment with similar United Nations institutions, but also to establish the fact that the poor state of its General Fund is a huge but avoidable impediment to UNITAR's delivery of its training programme, free of charge to all Member States, both developed and developing.</div>
	<div class="p">It is in this context that the oral statement of the Secretariat made during the Committee's adoption of its recommended draft resolution III came as a surprise to us all. As may be recalled, that oral statement said, among other things, that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"the Secretary-General does not have the discretionary authority to waive the provisions of General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213">resolution 41/213</a> and hence is not in a position to reclassify the rates charged to UNITAR for rent and maintenance costs, unless the General Assembly decides to make an express exception to its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213">resolution 41/213</a> in regard to recommendation 36".</div>
	<div class="p">Indeed, the poor financial situation of UNITAR deserves a remedy, which the General Assembly can provide.</div>
	<div class="p">We are keen, however, not to delay or postpone the adoption of draft resolution III by the General Assembly. We are therefore willing to go along with action on the draft, on the understanding that no action will be taken either on its operative paragraph 13 or on the oral statement of the Secretariat referred to. We believe that maintaining the current status quo until the fifty-sixth session through such a course of action will provide all parties an opportunity to discern and design a meaningful solution to the problem of UNITAR. On that understanding, the Group of 77 and China are willing to proceed with the consensus on the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">I would request, however, that this statement be reflected in the official records of the General Assembly.</div>
</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On behalf of the European Union, I would like to express our support for the statement just made by the representative of Nigeria on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.</div>
	<div class="p">We share the concern of the Group of 77 on the problem of the rental rates charged to the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). We had endorsed paragraph 13 of draft resolution III because we felt that it gave the Secretary-General a certain leeway to re-evaluate the rental rates charged to UNITAR. In this context, we were disappointed by the statement of the Secretariat explaining that this paragraph will have no practical implications. We, like the Group of 77, not wishing to delay the work of the Second Committee, agreed to join in the consensus on the draft resolution in its present form, but we hope that the General Assembly will find a more satisfactory and durable solution to this problem next year.</div>
	<div class="p">Like the Group of 77, we wish this statement to be reflected in the records of this meeting.</div>
