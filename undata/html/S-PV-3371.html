	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1994-508.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/508</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 27 April 1994 from the chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of the United Republic of Tanzania to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">&quot;The Security Council is appalled at continuing reports of the slaughter of innocent civilians in Kigali and other parts of Rwanda, and reported preparations for further massacres. It endorses the concern expressed by the Central Organ for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) that the massacres and wanton killings have continued unabated in a systematic manner in Rwanda. It recalls that such killings have already been condemned by the Security Council in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-912(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 912 (1994)</a> of 21 April 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">&quot;Attacks on defenceless civilians have occurred throughout the country, especially in areas under the control of members or supporters of the armed forces of the interim Government of Rwanda. The Security Council demands that the interim Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front take effective measures to prevent any attacks on civilians in areas under their control. It calls on the leadership of both parties to condemn publicly such attacks and to commit themselves to ensuring that persons who instigate or participate in such attacks are prosecuted and punished.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">&quot;The Security Council condemns all these breaches of international humanitarian law in Rwanda, particularly those perpetrated against the civilian population, and recalls that persons who instigate or participate in such acts are individually responsible. In this context, the Security Council recalls that the killing of members of an ethnic group with the intention of destroying such a group in whole or in part constitutes a crime punishable under international law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">&quot;The Security Council reiterates the demand in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-912(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 912 (1994)</a> for an immediate cease-fire and cessation of hostilities between the forces of the interim Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front. It commends the efforts by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Force Commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) to mediate such an outcome, and requests them to continue their efforts in liaison with countries of the region and the OAU. It also commends the courage and determination of UNAMIR personnel in affording protection to civilians who sought refuge with UNAMIR.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the efforts that have been made by countries of the region, with the assistance of the Organization of African Unity, to bring about an end to the fighting and the killings in Rwanda. It also commends the efforts of States, United Nations agencies, and non-governmental organizations to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to the suffering people of Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">&quot;The Security Council is deeply concerned at the situation of the many thousands of refugees and displaced persons who have been forced to flee the fighting and killings in Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">&quot;The Security Council calls on all States to assist the UNHCR and other humanitarian and relief agencies operating in the area in meeting the urgent humanitarian needs in Rwanda and its bordering States. The Council calls on States bordering Rwanda, working with the OAU, to provide appropriate protection to refugees and to facilitate transfer of goods and supplies to meet the needs of the displaced persons within Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">&quot;The Security Council calls on all Rwandan parties to guarantee the protection of displaced persons and refugees in Rwanda and refugees outside Rwanda and to ensure safe passage for humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">&quot;The Security Council underlines the urgent need for coordinated international action to help bring peace to Rwanda and to alleviate the suffering of the Rwandan people. It requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Secretary-General of the OAU and countries of the region, to take appropriate measures to ensure that international efforts to assist the situation in Rwanda are carried out in an effective and coordinated manner, and to ensure that all relevant parties are kept fully informed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">&quot;The Security Council emphasizes the importance of Kigali airport for the provision of international relief efforts to Rwanda, as well as for the requirements of UNAMIR. It calls on the parties to allow the airport to be kept open at all times for such purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">&quot;The Security Council stresses the importance of ensuring that the situation in Rwanda does not affect adversely the security and stability of neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">&quot;The Security Council warns that the situation in Rwanda would be further seriously aggravated if either of the parties were to have access to additional arms. It appeals to all States to refrain from providing arms or any military assistance to the parties to the conflict. It states its willingness in principle to consider promptly the application of an arms embargo to Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa17">&quot;The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to preserving the unity and territorial integrity of Rwanda. It reiterates its conviction that the Arusha Peace Agreement remains the only viable framework for the resolution of the Rwanda conflict and serves as the basis for peace, national unity and reconciliation in the country. It calls again on the parties to renew their commitment to this Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa18">&quot;The Security Council requests the Secretary-General:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa19">&quot;(a) in consultation with the Secretary-General of the OAU, to report further on action which may be undertaken with a view to assisting in the restoration of law and order in Rwanda and in providing security for displaced persons;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa20">&quot;(b) to work with UNHCR, the OAU and countries of the region to take such preventive diplomatic steps as may be necessary to prevent the spread of violence and atrocities to neighbouring countries;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa21">&quot;(c) to explore urgently ways of extending humanitarian relief assistance to refugees and displaced persons;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa22">&quot;(d) to consult the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on measures to provide humanitarian assistance to those displaced persons congregated along the borders with Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire and Burundi;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa23">&quot;(e) to bring to its attention any information that he might receive concerning arms flows into Rwanda, and to consult the countries of the region and the OAU about the practical implementation of an arms embargo on Rwanda; and</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa24">&quot;(f) to make proposals for investigation of the reports of serious violations of international humanitarian law during the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa25">&quot;The Security Council states its intention to consider urgently the letter of the Secretary-General dated 29 April 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-518.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/518</a>) and further recommendations that the Secretary-General may provide.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa26">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-21.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/21</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa27">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
