	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01"> I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Burundi, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council expresses its serious concern at the recent confrontations between the Palipehutu-FNL and the National Defence Forces of Burundi, following attacks by the Palipehutu-FNL, and the resulting loss of lives.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council condemns the use of violence, and calls again on the two parties to scrupulously respect the ceasefire concluded on 7 September 2006. It urges the Palipehutu-FNL to return immediately and without preconditions to the Joint Verification and Monitoring Mechanism and calls on both parties to resume their dialogue to overcome the obstacles that hinder the implementation of the Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement and delay the conclusion of the peace process in Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its support for the Regional Initiative, the South African Facilitation and other partners of Burundi, and encourages them to sustain their commitment to bring the parties to overcome the current crisis and implement the Programme of Action adopted in Cape Town on 22 and 23 February 2008. It supports a proactive role of the Political Directorate in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to play a robust political role in support of the peace process and to keep the Council closely informed of developments in Burundi, including in the context of his reports to the Security Council on the United Nations Integrated Office (BINUB).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council stresses that any attempt to jeopardize peace in Burundi through violent means is unacceptable, and expresses its intention to consider possible additional measures, as appropriate, in support of peace and stability in Burundi."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-10.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/10</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
