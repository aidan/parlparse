	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2005-800.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/800</a>, which contains a letter dated 15 December 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism, addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council recalls its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, by which it decided to establish a Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (hereinafter 'CTED') as a special political mission under the policy guidance of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) to enhance the Committee's ability to monitor implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and effectively continue the capacity-building work in which it was engaged. At the same time the Security Council decided to carry out a comprehensive review of CTED by 31 December 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"During today's consultations, the Security Council undertook this review and came to the following conclusions:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council endorsed the report prepared by the CTC and forwarded to the Council in <a href="../pdf/S-2005-800.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/800</a> and agreed with its conclusions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council noted that CTED had only been fully staffed since 6 September 2005 and welcomed the start that CTED had made on its objectives as set out in the revitalization process. It welcomed the fact that the CTC, in consultation with the Secretary-General, had decided to declare CTED operational on 15 December 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council recalled that CTED's mandate flows from that of the CTC and reaffirmed that the Committee has the sole responsibility for providing policy guidance to CTED. It also welcomed the fact that such guidance would be accompanied by implementation plans to enhance the Committee's ability effectively to implement its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council agreed with the Secretary-General and with the CTC that there is a need to clarify CTED's reporting lines, within the framework of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, and welcomed the Secretary-General's initiative in this regard. The Security Council expressed its readiness to work with him on this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council welcomed the integration into the work of the CTC of the issue of implementation by Member States of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1624 (2005)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council decided to carry out another comprehensive review of CTED by 31 December 2006, prepared by the CTC."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-64.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/64</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
