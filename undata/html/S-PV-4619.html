	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the briefing by the Chairman of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September 2001 (the Counter-Terrorism Committee) on the work of the Committee in the year since its establishment, and other reflections by members of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council recalls the statement of its President of 15 April 2002 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-10.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/10</a>) which recorded its intention to review the structure and activities of the Committee no later than 4 October 2002. The Council confirms the continuation of the current arrangements for the Bureau of the Committee for a further six months. It invites the Counter-Terrorism Committee to pursue its agenda as set out in the work programme for the Committee's fifth 90-day period (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1075.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1075</a>), focusing on ensuring that all States have legislation in place covering all aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, a process in hand for ratifying as soon as possible the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, and effective executive machinery for preventing and suppressing terrorism financing; exploring ways in which States can be assisted to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, in particular in the areas of primary focus; and building a dialogue with international, regional and subregional organizations active in the areas covered by the resolution. The Security Council invites these organizations to continue to find ways of improving their collective action against terrorism and, where appropriate, to work with donor States to establish suitable programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction that 174 Member States and 5 others have submitted a report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee pursuant to paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It calls on the 17 Member States which have not yet submitted a report to do so urgently.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council invites the Counter-Terrorism Committee to report on its activities at regular intervals and expresses its intention to review the structure and activities of the Committee no later than 4 April 2003."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-26.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/26</a>.</p>
