	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest possible terms the attempt on the life of the President of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta, during an attack at his residence on 11 February 2008, and wishes him a speedy recovery. The Council also condemns the attack on the convoy of the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste, Xanana Gusmão. These represent an attack on the legitimate institutions of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council calls on the Government of Timor-Leste to bring to justice those responsible for this heinous act, and urges all parties in Timor-Leste to cooperate actively with the authorities in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council further calls upon all people in Timor-Leste to remain calm, exercise restraint and maintain stability in the country. The Security Council urges all parties in Timor-Leste to resolve any disputes through political and peaceful means within the framework of its democratic institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms its full support to the Government and people of Timor-Leste in their continued efforts to strengthen democracy and ensure public security and maintain stability in their country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the work of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste and for the continued deployment of the international security force in response to the requests of the Government of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to report on developments in Timor-Leste, as necessary. The Security Council will continue to monitor closely the situation in Timor-Leste and will act, as appropriate."</blockquote>
