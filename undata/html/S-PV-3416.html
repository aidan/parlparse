	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1994-888.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/888</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 26 July 1994 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">&quot;The Security Council is deeply concerned by the letter of the Secretary-General dated 26 July 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-888.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/888</a>) and by further reports from the Secretariat of continuing difficulties that have arisen for the operations of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Croatia owing to blockades of UNPROFOR traffic into the United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) by demonstrators. The Council considers that such blockades by Croatian citizens as well as related impediments imposed by the Croatian authorities on the freedom of movement of UNPROFOR are inadmissible. In that context, the Council deplores the remaining blockades of access roads to the United Nations Protected Areas in the Republic of Croatia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">&quot;The Council is encouraged by the signing on 4 August of an agreement between the Government of the Republic of Croatia and UNPROFOR regarding the procedures regulating UNPROFOR traffic to and from the UNPAs and calls on the Croatian authorities to faithfully implement its provisions. The Council welcomes the progress that has been made since the signature of this agreement to open eleven of nineteen crossing points. However, the Council reminds the Government of the Republic of Croatia of its obligation to facilitate UNPROFOR's unimpeded access to all 19 crossing points agreed upon in the cease-fire agreement of 29 March 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">&quot;In this context, the Council is also concerned about the continuing unacceptable practice of the Government of the Republic of Croatia of levying tolls and other taxes on the Force for the use of roads and airports in the Republic of Croatia. The Council strongly disapproves of any action that would both impede the functioning of UNPROFOR and add to the already high cost of the peace-keeping operation in Croatia. Recalling operative paragraph 7 of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-908(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 908 (1994)</a>, the Council again urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia to conclude without further delay a Status of Forces Agreement with UNPROFOR and to resolve the above and any other issues in accordance with the provisions of that agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">&quot;The Council reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia and the right of all displaced persons and refugees to return to their homes. The Council expects the Government of the Republic of Croatia to cooperate fully with the efforts of UNPROFOR.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-44.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/44</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item of the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
