	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council expresses its grave concern at the resurgence of violence in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its potential regional implications. It is alarmed by the humanitarian consequences of the recent fighting and urges all parties to immediately respect a ceasefire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern over continued threats to the safety of the civilian population and to the conduct of humanitarian operations. The Council strongly condemns the continuing recruitment and use of children by armed groups, as well as the continued prevalence of sexual and gender-based violence in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It urges all parties to comply fully with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It once again calls on all armed groups to immediately lay down their arms and present themselves without any further delay or preconditions to Congolese authorities and the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) for their disarmament, repatriation, resettlement and/or reintegration, as appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms that the Goma and Nairobi processes constitute the framework within which long-term stability in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo should be pursued. The Security Council urges all the parties to the Goma and Nairobi agreements to implement their commitments effectively and in good faith. In this respect, the Council strongly condemns the recent declarations by Laurent Nkunda calling for a national rebellion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its strong support to MONUC in helping restore peace in the Kivus and encourages MONUC to reinforce its action to ensure the protection of civilians. The Council expresses its full support for the disengagement plan elaborated by MONUC and accepted by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and urges all parties to abide by it.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council welcomes MONUC's intention to reconfigure its forces and optimize their deployment so as to enhance its efficiency within the existing mandate and troop ceiling. The Security Council takes note of the additional capacities for MONUC requested by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. The Council requests the Secretary-General to present a full analysis of the situation and recommendations in his next report to the Council.</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council urges the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to take effective steps to ensure that there is no cooperation between elements of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda. The Council also calls upon the Governments in the region to cease all support to the armed groups in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council urges the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Government of the Republic of Rwanda to urgently engage in efforts to settle their differences, including through reactivating the Joint Verification Mechanism, and calls upon them to implement the Nairobi communiqué fully. The Council encourages the Secretary-General to step up his efforts to facilitate dialogue between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council strongly condemns the recent attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), including the abduction by the LRA of 159 schoolchildren in villages in Oriental Province. The Council recalls the International Criminal Court indictments against members of the LRA leadership on charges of, among other things, the enlistment of children through abduction, as a war crime."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-38.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/38</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
