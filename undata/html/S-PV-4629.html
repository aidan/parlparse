	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now proceed to the election of five members of the International Court of Justice, in accordance with Article 13 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, to fill the five seats which will become vacant on 6 February 2003 on the expiry of the terms of office of the following Judges: Mr. Shi Jiuyong (China), Mr. Shigeru Oda (Japan), Mr. Géza Herczegh (Hungary), Mr. Carl-August Fleischhauer (Germany), and Mr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The list of candidates nominated by national groups is contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-926.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/926</a>, which reflects all the information concerning notifications received regarding such nominations in order to facilitate the election of all representatives.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the Council to the fact that the Secretary-General informed me this morning that Mr. Kamba and Mr. Manase of Zimbabwe have decided that they no longer wish to be considered as candidates for election to the International Court of Justice. Their names, therefore, do not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">The Security Council also has before it a memorandum by the Secretary-General, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-925.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/925</a>, describing the present composition of the Court and setting out the procedure to be followed in the conduct of the election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">I should like to remind the Council that, under Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"Those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of votes in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">The required majority in the Security Council is eight votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">If more than five candidates obtain the required majority, according to the procedure which has been followed in the past and which is set forth in paragraph 14 of the Secretary-General's memorandum, a new vote will be held on all the candidates.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This rule will also apply to any subsequent ballots, if the number of candidates obtaining the absolute majority is greater than the number of vacancies remaining. If, on the other hand, in the first ballot the number of candidates obtaining the absolute majority is less than five, the Council will proceed to a second ballot on the remaining vacancies, and balloting will continue in the same manner until five of the candidates have obtained the required majority of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The voting will be held by secret ballot. When we proceed to the vote, members of the Council will receive a ballot paper containing the names of all the candidates. No withdrawal will be accepted once the ballot papers have been distributed. However, it would be possible to withdraw between ballots. Members of the Council will be requested to place an "X" in the boxes next to the names of the candidates for whom they wish to vote. Only those candidates whose names appear on the ballot paper are eligible for election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">I should like to remind members of paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General's memorandum (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-925.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/925</a>), which specifies that "Each elector may vote for not more than five candidates on the first ballot". Any ballot paper containing votes for more than five names will be considered invalid. When five candidates have obtained the required majority of votes, I shall communicate the result of the election to the President of the General Assembly, and I shall request the Council to remain in session, pending the receipt from the President of the General Assembly of the result of the voting in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">The Council will now proceed to draw lots to select two delegations to serve as tellers.</p>
