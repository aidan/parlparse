	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council is deeply concerned by the resumption of hostilities in the Republic of Croatia over the last few days.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council demands that the Government of the Republic of Croatia put an end immediately to the military offensive launched by its forces in the area of Western Slavonia known as Sector West which started on the morning of 1 May 1995 in violation of the cease-fire agreement of 29 March 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council also demands that the parties respect the economic agreement signed between them on 2 December 1994 and, in particular, take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of the Zagreb-Belgrade Highway and its immediate environs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council urges the parties to cease hostilities and comply with the existing cease-fire agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council calls upon the parties to fully respect the safety and freedom of movement of all United Nations and European Community Monitoring Mission personnel in the area concerned, in the area known as Sector South and elsewhere, and therefore to remove all restrictions placed on United Nations personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"The Security Council urges the parties, in order to achieve these objectives, to accept without delay the proposals put to them by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">"The Security Council expresses its full support to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in their efforts. The Council further requests the Secretary-General to keep it informed of developments on the ground as well as in the ongoing talks."</p>
