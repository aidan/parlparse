	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">The first speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Haiti, to whom I now give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lelong</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Your skill and experience, Mr. President, have ensured the effective and efficient work of the Security Council during this month of July, for which we congratulate you. We also congratulate Mr. Sergey Lavrov, Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, who so remarkably conducted the work of the Council in the month of June.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The continuous efforts of the international community to support the determination of the Haitian people to defend its democratic process have contributed to the restoration of constitutional government, after the <i>coup d'état </i>of 30 September 1991. Since that time, it continues to support our people in its quest for economic well-being and the consolidation of democratic victories.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Despite difficulties of all kinds that have been encountered, appreciable results have been achieved. The Haitian people fully enjoys its civil and political rights. Fundamental freedoms are respected. The reform of our institutions is off to a good start. The Haitian National Police is in operation and is recording constant progress, although at a slower pace than desired. The judicial and the criminal systems are slowly improving. The primacy of law over force is gradually establishing itself as custom. Archaic structures and attitudes are being entirely reversed. The rule of law and the establishment of development focused on the human being are being institutionalized. We are witnessing the development of a national policy that attempts to respond to the needs of the majority. Long-term projects have begun to replace emergency programmes and humanitarian activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Nevertheless, serious problems persist. The precariousness of the economic situation, together with the lack of relief agencies, places additional dangerous pressures on the foundations of our still young core institutions. Social tensions are sharply exacerbated by the perennial postponement of popular claims whose legitimacy and urgency cannot be challenged. The proliferation of criminal acts and organized crime, previously unknown in Haiti, creates a pernicious climate of insecurity and alarm among the population. This wave of criminal violence, added to the demonstrations of discontent caused by the difficult economic situation, puts the Haitian National Police, a fledgling and underequipped force, to a stiff test. In that connection, we must underscore the new and growing challenge posed by the deportation by certain Governments of Haitians guilty of criminal acts without any prior consultation with Haitian authorities on follow-up or custody of these dangerous elements, who once in Haiti engage in all kinds of illicit and criminal activities. We have also witnessed the emergence of drug trafficking, car theft, armed robbery, abductions and weapons trafficking.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">These alarming elements have been underscored by the Secretary-General in his report of 19 July on the situation in Haiti, for which we thank him. In a still troubled climate, he recognizes justifiably that despite definite progress the Haitian National Police is not capable of meeting alone all the challenges that face it. The Government is making intensive efforts in concert with the international community to complete as quickly as possible the training of this institution that was set up just two years ago. However, certain important tasks have yet to be carried out in order for it to achieve the proper degree of professionalism and efficiency. These tasks, by their nature, will continue to require the assistance of United Nations personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">We are convinced that the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) -- which the Secretary-General recommends be established to relieve the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), whose mandate expires tomorrow -- will be able to help the Haitian authorities complete their work and prepare a smooth transition to another type of commitment to Haiti by the international community. A sustained commitment, particularly by international financial institutions, is necessary to promote a successful programme of integrated and sustainable development that will guarantee the stability of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The draft resolution before the Council for consideration responds to these concerns, and we invite the members of the Council to adopt it unanimously.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">The delegation of Haiti would like to thank the members of the Caucus of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States that have supported our request. Our gratitude also goes out to the group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti, and particularly to the United States of America and Canada for their decisive political and financial support for the Mission. I would also like to underscore the understanding of China and the Russian Federation. Our sincere thanks also go out to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Enrique ter Horst, the commanders of the military and civilian elements and the men and women who accompany the Haitian people along the road to the social and economic reconstruction of their country.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Haiti for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Canada. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate today in the Security Council's debate on the situation in Haiti. Canada is also pleased that the members of the Council seem prepared to adopt a draft resolution implementing the recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his most recent report on the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Canada sees the draft resolution that is to be adopted today as a significant milestone -- the most recent in the series of steps taken by the international community to consolidate democratic government in Haiti. This adoption is also, we believe, an event of considerable importance for the United Nations. First and foremost, this draft resolution establishes a new Mission to assist the Government of Haiti through a final transition period of four months, beginning on 1 August. But it is also important for what it augurs for the medium and the long term in Haiti, beginning in December this year with the end of the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Over the next four months, the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti will continue to help the Government of Haiti professionalize its police force, as President Préval requested last November. Starting from zero only two years ago, the Haitian National Police (HNP) has made slow but continuous progress towards the point at which it will assume complete responsibility for all police functions in Haiti. The mandate of the Transition Mission reflects this progress. The civilian police officers of the United Nations will now concentrate their efforts at departmental headquarters and at the HNP national headquarters in Port-au-Prince. This geographic concentration should permit the civilian police force to focus on the very specific training needs of the National Police.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">It should be underlined that the responsibility for maintaining the security and stability of the country will now be assumed by the Government of Haiti as the Transition Mission develops a plan and timetable for the early and efficient handover of these responsibilities to the National Police. With its leaner and more focused mandate, the Mission will undergo a corresponding reduction of its personnel and will thus complete its transformation from the large peacekeeping operation established in 1995, with a strength of approximately 6,000 military and 700 civilian police personnel, to a contingent of 250 civilian police and a headquarters unit of 50 military personnel having full command and control over a voluntarily funded security element.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Canada supports the draft resolution that the Council seems poised to adopt. Having participated in the consultations on the draft, we would like to pay tribute to the other members of the group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti for the invaluable role they have played in Haiti's progress to date, and also to express appreciation for the steadfast support of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States throughout these negotiations. Canada would also like to thank members of the Council, the Russian Federation and China for the exceptionally collegial and constructive manner in which discussions on the draft resolution took place.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">We are particularly pleased that the United Nations will have command and control over the Mission's security element. With this essential precondition met, Canada is prepared to commit approximately 650 Canadian troops as a voluntary contribution, entirely at our own expense, to UNTMIH's security element. In addition, we expect that 60 Canadian Civilian Police (CIVPOL) officers will be made available to participate in the United Nations Mission until the end of November this year. Our soldiers look forward to continuing their mission under United Nations command and control and to maintaining their extremely happy association with their Pakistani colleagues, with whom they have operated so effectively over these past two years.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Similarly, our police monitors, who will make up about one quarter of the international force, are proud to associate themselves with this multinational effort to provide the people of Haiti with an effective and reliable police force, a sine qua non for a stable democracy. We are also pleased that the French Government will again make a major contribution of CIVPOL officers to the new Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The Council's deliberations here today offer an example of how, in recent years, the United Nations and the international community as a whole have been able to develop new and innovative ways of responding to the needs of nascent democracies. Indeed, peacekeeping in Haiti has not followed the classic peacekeeping model as it was understood for many years by this Organization. We believe Security Council-mandated missions have made a significant contribution to institution-building in Haiti over the past two years and, while United Nations military troops will be withdrawing in four months' time, we anticipate that they will use the coming transition period well to consolidate the progress they have achieved over the past couple of years.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">We welcome the Secretary-General's assertion in his recent report that the end of UNTMIH and of the United Nations military presence in Haiti, and the transitional phase to which I have referred, will not mean the end of United Nations involvement in Haiti. We must all acknowledge the reality that it will take much more time, effort and generosity to create truly effective and stable institutions of democracy and to foster long-term economic stability in Haiti. The problems, as we are all well aware, are deep-seated, and Haiti will be able to address them only with the steadfast economic and technical support of the international community over the many years to come.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">In particular, we hope that we can continue to build on the peace-building and institution-building in which UNSMIH, the joint Organization of American States/United Nations International Civilian Mission in Haiti, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to name but a few, have all been engaged through their varied and vitally important programmes. As the draft resolution before us suggests, such endeavours should now become the focus of the international community's assistance to Haiti, and we look forward to the Secretary-General's report in two months' time on subsequent peace-building international assistance to Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Certainly a commitment to the peace-building process in Haiti is one of the principal pillars of Canada's bilateral relationship with Haiti. In addition to food aid and humanitarian assistance, Canada's very large bilateral development programme has included such small-scale but fundamentally important projects as the reconstruction of courthouses, support for the reorganization of the Justice Ministry and fiscal reform. Over the coming four months, however, we intend to work very closely with the Government of Haiti, the donor community, the United Nations Secretariat, the specialized agencies, funds and programmes and the international financial institutions to determine how best to meet Haiti's needs in the longer term.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The next four months will be important ones for Haiti. Among other important steps, its civil police will be assuming full responsibility for all police functions throughout Haiti. We believe that all the various actors in the international community, Canada among them, must continue to play a full part in providing support and assistance to Haiti as political stability, respect for fundamental freedoms and economic development take root.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">In closing, on a personal note, allow me not only to thank you, Mr. President, for your excellent leadership of the Council's deliberations over the course of this busy month, but also to express my country's deep appreciation for your extraordinary contribution to the United Nations over the five years you have represented Sweden so effectively among us. In all things, you have simultaneously represented your country's interests while protecting the prestige and authority of the United Nations, and you have done so with poise and dignity. We will miss you greatly and wish only good things for you and your family in the years to come.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Petrella</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">Allow me first of all to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your excellent leadership of the work of the Security Council. I also wish to congratulate Ambassador Lavrov on the results achieved under his presidency in the month of June.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Allow me also to join the Council in expressing, on behalf of the Government and the people of Argentina, the strongest repudiation of the tragic attacks in Jerusalem this morning. We offer the people of Israel our sincere feelings of solidarity.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">By adopting the draft resolution that is to be put to the vote, we will be renewing our assistance to Haiti for institutionalization and democratization. The report of the Secretary-General attests to the contribution of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) to the political stabilization of Haiti. Nonetheless, we believe that the attainment of that objective will not depend only on the new United Nations presence, but also on the will and determination of all Haitian political forces. In this regard, the statement just made by the Ambassador of Haiti gives us cause for optimism and peace of mind.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The deployment of the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti will require two kinds of effort: one economic and the other political. First and foremost, our delegation wishes to thank the Member States that are voluntarily contributing money and personnel, especially the United States, Canada and countries from the developing world, to make this new Mission in Haiti possible. We also wish to state our willingness to rejoin this effort whenever necessary. Secondly, we wish to express our appreciation for the understanding displayed by the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China in overcoming their reservations on the continuation of an international presence of this new type in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">Less than two weeks ago, through a presidential statement, the Security Council said that civilian police in peacekeeping operations carry our indispensable functions in monitoring and training national police forces, as well as in restoring civil order, supporting the rule of law and fostering reconciliation at the national level. It also pointed out the capacity of civilian police in such operations to prevent and contain conflicts and consolidate peace. We hope that these conclusions will now be borne out once again in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">Finally, we wish to congratulate the office of the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations for its effective efforts in making progress on this important issue, both in Haiti and at Headquarters.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Argentina for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Venezuela. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Rojas</span> <span class="nation">Venezuela</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your presidency of the Security Council this month.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">Venezuela is pleased to be a sponsor of the draft resolution submitted to the Council, which we hope will be adopted in a few moments. As the Council knows, we are linked to Haiti by two centuries of historical and geographical ties, which has led us to take an active part in the process of stabilization and democratic consolidation in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">Venezuela praises the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) for the considerable progress it achieved in fulfilment of its mandate to assist the Government of Haiti in maintaining a secure and stable environment. The Mission dealt with one of its most difficult challenges last year, when the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected President to another took place. Since then a year and a half has passed, and, as we have seen, the process has not come to halt. Gradual progress has been evident, and successful steps continue to be taken, although, naturally, not without certain problems and missteps.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">The reduction in the number of military personnel shows that the Mission has had positive results, and it is to be hoped that Haiti will set itself firmly and definitively on the road to reconstruction and development, in accordance with the hopes and desires of the Haitian people. In this regard, we welcome this last extension of the Support Mission, since an abrupt withdrawal of forces would not have been the most advisable move, and we must give it the opportunity to conclude the operation in the best possible way.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">I cannot let this opportunity pass without mentioning the work also being done by the International Civilian Mission in Haiti, which the General Assembly will again consider tomorrow. Its consolidation will allow for the long-term success of the educational institution-building process in Haiti. We have great faith in the joint work of the United Nations and the Organization of American States in that connection.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">We are all aware that the Government and people of Haiti bear the principal responsibility for the political, economic, social and institutional reconstruction of the country, but we also know that, if long-term peace and stability are to be attained, it is indispensable that the international community make a sustained commitment to cooperation. That is why we are present here today.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">Once again, I reiterate Venezuela's political will to continue to lend all its support to this cause, in keeping with the wishes of the people of Haiti themselves.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk03-pa04">I shall first give the floor to those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dejammet</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa01">The establishment of a public force that respects the law is an essential element of Haiti's transition to democracy. To that end, the United Nations has supported the action of the Haitian Government.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa02">This was made possible by the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Haiti and subsequently of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), which was established in June 1996 and extended last December. That assistance has played a central role in the efforts to enhance the efficiency of the Haitian National Police.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa03">As the Secretary-General stresses in his report of 19 July, the training of a new national police force represents a long-term undertaking. Since the extension of UNSMIH last December, this professionalization effort has continued and -- as the Ambassador of Haiti mentioned earlier -- substantial progress has been made.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa04">The Haitian National Police is already having a positive effect on security in the country, but we must also recognize -- again, as stressed by the Ambassador of Haiti -- that security conditions there remain unstable. New types of organized crime are emerging. The National Police is not yet fully able to meet these challenges. Progress has therefore yet to be achieved, <i>inter alia</i>, in the areas of recruitment, equipment management and training.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa05">For these reasons, France supports the request of the Haitian authorities that the United Nations presence be maintained to the end of November. It also supports the Secretary-General's recommendations to that effect. As a member of the group of "Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti", France participated in preparing the draft resolution before the Council and will vote in its favour.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa06">The draft resolution proposes the establishment of the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti for the next four months. That mission will help the Haitian authorities to pursue the professionalization of the police. The objective is to strengthen the Haitian National Police so as to enable it, by the end of the transition, fully to carry out its functions.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa07">I pay tribute to the efforts of the contributing countries, particularly Canada. For its part, France will contribute to the new mission at a similar level to its contribution to UNSMIH. I would recall that this contribution currently includes 29 gendarmes and 17 police officers.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Larraín</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I take this opportunity to reiterate my delegation's pleasure that the Council has been able to agree on the formula recommended by the Secretary-General in his report of 19 July to ensure the United Nations presence in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The United Nations presence in Haiti dates to 1990, since when it has contributed -- not without some difficulties -- to the establishment of democracy and economic recovery in that country. It is clear that, without that presence, it would have been impossible for the people of Haiti to make the progress it has made to date -- progress on which the United Nations may justly pride itself. Indeed, despite the difficulties that have been faced, the Organization's main mission of bringing stability and democracy to that country has borne important fruit. For the first time, one democratically elected Government is succeeding another. Considerable achievements have been made in human rights and in creating and consolidating basic institutions, such as the police and the judiciary.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Perhaps the best way to assess the success attained to date would be to ask what would have happened in Haiti if the United Nations had not been involved in this stabilization phase. It is not difficult to imagine that, in such a case, Haiti would have been plunged into a profound political and economic crisis, with immeasurable human consequences. Such a scenario is unacceptable, which is why we should be rightly proud of our support for the efforts of the democratic forces in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The adoption of the draft resolution before us today is in keeping with the same logic that led to the United Nations presence in Haiti in 1990: providing that country with the opportunity to rise from the swamp of dictatorship, corruption, violence and poverty and fostering institutional reconstruction, national reconciliation and economic rehabilitation. We adopt this draft resolution today aware that, while the Organization's objectives have not yet been fully met, we are far further along -- almost at the end of that first great task.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">When the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti has completed its work in four months, the democratic regime must be minimally self-sustaining as the result of the consolidation of the basic elements of a police force committed to law and respect for human rights. This minimum achievement will be fundamental to the ability of the democratic forces of Haiti to continue on their own from whom we also expect a deeper commitment to the fate of their own institutions. This will require them to have a long-term vision that sees beyond short-term jockeying for power and to demonstrate greater flexibility and the capacity to achieve a basic consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">We are all aware, however, that if democracy is to function it must be planted in fertile ground. That is why we are convinced that the international community must subsequently address not only security and political stability, as it is now doing, but also and with greater emphasis the economic development of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">For this reason, we welcome the provisions of the draft resolution before us, which stresses the need for financial and economic assistance. We must break the vicious cycle whereby, on the one hand, there is no security without development and, on the other, there is no development without security. The United Nations must preserve its achievements by focusing on these two closely interrelated aspects of stability. Failure to do so would mean wasting all the efforts we have made in Haiti and subjecting that country to the risk of being sucked once again into the spiral of violence and chaos.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">We trust that there will soon be well-directed and tangible evidence of the commitment of the international community and the international financial institutions. It is important that the United Nations take the lead in this regard. Our country is prepared to study any formulas proposed in order to ensure this commitment to long-term international support for Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">Before concluding, I wish to express my sincere thanks to the Secretary-General, to his Special Representative and, through the Secretary-General, to all the agencies operating in Haiti for the excellent work they have done. I also wish to express my country's deep gratitude to the Government of Canada for continuing to provide the forces that are making it possible to stabilize the situation in Haiti and to all the countries that are contributing to this noble cause.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Berrocal Soto</span> <span class="nation">Costa Rica</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">First of all, I would like to offer my regards to you, Mr. President, and convey my delegation's satisfaction at the efficient and transparent way in which you have presided over the work of the Security Council during the month of July.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">By adopting this draft resolution on Haiti today, which my country is honoured to co-sponsor, the Security Council will be clearly and firmly endorsing a broader and more comprehensive view of the concept of international peace and security, which we are duty-bound to protect and defend, in accordance with the Charter. This new approach to our responsibilities encompasses difficult and complex situations such as that in Haiti, and also arises in many of the other items on the Security Council's agenda, particularly in the case of certain raging conflicts in Africa and Asia.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Poverty and extreme underdevelopment are threats to international peace and security. Civil wars and massive flows of refugees are also objective threats to international peace and security. The same applies to extreme environmental degradation, terrorism, and a number of socio-political phenomena and aspects of religious fanaticism that have emerged in recent years and that we have been forced to include on the international agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The maintenance of international peace and security, which is the Security Council's main responsibility, should therefore be seen from a broader and more comprehensive standpoint than the classical concept of conflict between States or the ideological reasons and circumstances that divided the world into blocs during the cold war.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">This draft resolution on Haiti makes it clear that we are making progress in unity and without major discrepancies. We are moving in the right direction in terms of understanding what -- today, in 1997 -- constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Similarly, we are making progress towards incorporating the concept of the defence and protection of human rights as an essential and mandatory component of the Security Council's deliberations and agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">With regard to Haiti, the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions, the rule of law and full respect for human rights. However, this will not solve Haiti's major economic and social development problems, which are so starkly reflected in the United Nations Development Programme's human development index. This aspect, as is rightly set out in the draft resolution, is as urgent as the matter before us today, and the debate on that question goes on. This is the case in Haiti and in many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, where underdevelopment, inequalities and extreme poverty pose a real threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">I would like to thank the Secretary-General, countries that are friends to Haiti and the Latin American and Caribbean Group for their constant concern and for the steps taken in recent weeks to reach this consensus in the Security Council. I would also like to thank Canada, the United States of America, France, Pakistan and other countries whose support in terms of military personnel, civilian police, logistics and financing is making the Mission in Haiti possible. By adopting this draft resolution, we will be undoubtedly supporting the people of Haiti. However, at the same time, we will be helping the United Nations move forward and determine its proper role in facing the real challenges before the international community at the end of the twentieth century.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I thank the representative of Costa Rica for the kind words addressed to me.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Xuexian</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa01">China attaches great importance to the peace process in Haiti and has all along supported the positive efforts made by the United Nations and the international community in this regard. We welcome the progress made by Haiti in political, economic and social fields in recent years with the help of the international community. We also appreciate the efforts and the contributions made by the countries concerned. We sincerely hope that Haiti will enjoy long-term stability and that its people will live and work in peace and contentment.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa02">China holds that the situation in Haiti no longer poses a threat to international peace and security and that the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti has already been completed. The main task now facing Haiti is economic reconstruction and development, which should mainly be the responsibility of the Haitian people themselves. In this connection, the international community, particularly international financial institutions and other United Nations agencies, should play an active role.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa03">At the same time, considering the urgent request of the Haitian Government and the wishes of Latin American and Caribbean countries, the Chinese Government supports the establishment of the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti as a transitional measure. We hope that it will work together with Haiti's National Police Force and the new Government to promote security and development in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa04">In view of the fact that the draft resolution before us has accommodated the request of the Haitian Government and taken into proper consideration the concerns of the interested parties, the Chinese delegation will vote in favour of it.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gorelik</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">The Russian delegation notes with satisfaction that there has been some improvement in the situation in Haiti in terms of security and prospects for establishing conditions for freedom and tolerance. However, the situation remains unstable, which is cause for concern.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">We believe that the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, which played a significant role in strengthening the foundations of constitutional democracy, fully acquitted itself of the task the Security Council entrusted to it in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1063(1996).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1063 (1996)</a>. We are convinced, as emphasized in the draft resolution before the Security Council, that the people of Haiti bear primary responsibility for national reconciliation and the reconstruction of their country.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Russia's position on Haiti is well known. In itself, the situation in that country has not posed and does not pose a threat to regional peace and security. This is a typical situation for many developing countries: a complicated transition to democracy, which unfortunately does not have strong roots in Haitian society. The situation is, moreover, exacerbated by the protracted social and economic crisis. We are convinced that the sustainable development of Haiti requires a considered, purposeful effort at reform on the part of the Haitian Government. At the same time, external assistance is important as well. The international community must continue to provide technical, economic and financial assistance to support political stability, balanced development, the establishment of democratic institutions and respect for human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">We are not opposed to maintaining a United Nations presence in Haiti, but it must be commensurate with the real requirements of the hour. We are therefore prepared to support the Secretary-General's recommendation that a new United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) be established; it would cooperate closely with specialized agencies of the United Nations and with other international institutions and would focus primarily on continuing to help strengthen the Haitian National Police. The Russian delegation sees no compelling reason for retaining a United Nations military presence in Haiti, but we have acceded to the wishes of our partners -- and here we would like to make special mention of the constructive position of Canada -- bearing in mind the appeal of President Préval, the recommendations of the Secretary-General, and the views of the group of "Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti" and contributors to the civilian police element. We have done this on the understanding that, as stipulated in the draft resolution before us, the Transition Mission will have a clearly defined, single four-month mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Unfortunately, problems -- particularly in the area of internal security -- will inevitably persist following the withdrawal of the new mission; these will have to be resolved not by a United Nations peacekeeping operation but by non-United Nations machinery. We shall look forward to the Secretary-General's specific recommendations in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">I wish to stress in conclusion that work on this draft resolution demonstrated once again that a constructive approach and due consideration for the positions and interests of all parties can enable the Security Council to find solutions acceptable to all. We are grateful to the sponsors of the draft resolution for taking account of all our proposals.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">The Russian delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Park</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">With the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) coming to a successful conclusion, we would like to commend the men and women of UNSMIH for their outstanding service in the cause of peace and democracy in Haiti and of the well-being of the Haitian people. We are also grateful to the countries which have contributed troops and civilian personnel to the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">Since its establishment in June of last year, UNSMIH has played a significant role in helping the Government and the people of Haiti achieve considerable progress in their quest for democracy and lasting stability. It is disappointing, however, to note that progress has not been sufficient to warrant the termination of the United Nations presence at this stage. The overall situation in Haiti still remains precarious and fragile, as shown by ongoing political disturbances, social unrest and a surge of crime, compounded by the country's economic plight. In the light of these dire circumstances, we are deeply concerned that the Haitian National Police is not yet fully prepared to cope on its own with the daunting security challenges currently facing Haiti. The young police force still has to grapple with many problems in crucial areas, including lack of leadership, poor logistics and an insufficient level of specialization.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Korea has consistently held the view that the establishment of a full-fledged Haitian National Police Force is the keystone of peace and security in Haiti. It is with this conviction that my Government has already contributed $200,000 to the voluntary fund established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-975(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 975 (1995)</a> to support the Haitian National Police. My Government is considering further ways of assisting the Haitian police, on a bilateral basis, in the area of police equipment, with a view to enhancing the operational capability of the young police force at this critical juncture.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">In view of the current situation in Haiti, so ably described today by the representative of Haiti, we cannot but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished, and that sustained international assistance remains essential. For these reasons, and also taking due note of the request of the Haitian Government and the wishes of the countries of the region, we support the establishment of a United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH), as recommended by the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">My delegation notes with satisfaction that the draft resolution before us reflects the progress already achieved by UNSMIH as well as the essential requirements for the new Mission. The mandate is fully geared to the most pressing task, that of the professionalization of the police force; the mandate will be limited to a single four-month period; and UNTMIH retains a military element to ensure the safety of the civilian police personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">We are also pleased to note that the difficult financial situation of the United Nations has been duly addressed in the draft resolution, through a substantial reduction in troop strength. In this connection, we welcome the readiness of the Governments of Canada and the United States to continue to provide generous voluntary contributions to support the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">In our view, the history of United Nations missions in Haiti exemplifies remarkable success in combining a traditional peacekeeping operation with post-conflict peace-building. With the establishment of UNTMIH, Haiti now embarks on a transition from a peacekeeping phase to a peace-building phase. It is our earnest hope that the Government and the people of Haiti, together with the international community, will make concerted efforts to make this transition smooth and complete in the coming four months.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, my delegation would like to stress that the ultimate responsibility for the future of Haiti lies with the Government and the people of Haiti themselves, and that international support cannot be a substitute for their efforts to consolidate the rule of law and democracy and to achieve economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">With these remarks, Korea will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahugu</span> <span class="nation">Kenya</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">As Haiti struggles to emerge from its turbulent past into a future of peace and stability, Kenya is optimistic that the historically resilient spirit of the Haitian people will overcome all odds and rebuild that great nation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">My delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us. Kenya's vote today is a gesture in support of the Haitian people. We believe that a minimal but continued United Nations presence, to be known as the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH), will be useful in consolidating the gains which were made by the Haitians with the help of the outgoing United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH). This will be a neutral force with a clear mandate, and it must be viewed by all Haitians from all walks of life as that and nothing more. My delegation also agrees with the recommendation of the Secretary-General in his report that such a force should not stay in Haiti for too long and that a four-month duration is quite adequate.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">Kenya believes that peace is a necessary condition for development. The relative insecurity now prevailing in Haiti is largely the result of poverty and lack of improvement in the basic living conditions of the Haitian people. Only a concerted, whole-hearted attack on poverty and a complete focus on sustainable development will alleviate Haiti's problems. In this regard, my delegation is happy to note that the draft resolution recognizes that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">My delegation commends the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti for their untiring efforts, and especially those of the men and women of UNSMIH for their courage and hard work in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">Finally, my delegation calls on all the Haitian people to work together to rebuild their nation. With turmoil, development will remain as elusive as peace has been. At the end of the day, it is the Haitian people, and especially their leaders, who must propel and navigate their nation towards the future prosperity of all, and in this regard, Kenya can only wish them the greatest success.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Monteiro</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Portugal agrees with the assessment of the political and the security situation in Haiti made by the Secretary-General in his latest report.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Indeed, despite some progress, the situation in the country remains fragile, both in political and economic fields. The continued support of the international community remains vital for the political stability and economic development of Haiti. Without it, it would be much more difficult for the Haitian people to build a society based on the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">We also believe that the international presence in Haiti, and the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) in particular, has been extremely important, specifically by assisting the Government to form a public force respectful of legality and by helping to consolidate the transition to democracy. Had UNSMIH not been there, the situation would undoubtedly be far worse. It is very significant in this respect that despite their differences, the Haitian authorities and the main political leaders have requested the maintenance of the United Nations presence in that country. In fact, a self-sustained and fully functioning police force is essential in order to ensure a secure and stable environment, economic rehabilitation and the consolidation of democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">We concur with the conclusions of the Secretary-General's report that, so far, the Haitian National Police has not reached the level of professionalization required to tackle successfully the problems in fields such as criminal investigation, narcotics and crowd control, among others.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">My delegation will therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution before us today on the creation of a new Mission in Haiti, and we consider that the maintenance of a United Nations presence for a period of four months, until 30 November 1997, is of the utmost importance.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">We look forward to the Secretary-General's recommendations on the nature of a subsequent international presence in Haiti, in the fields of public security and judicial reform, as well as in monitoring human rights, as called for in the draft resolution before us today. Vitally important to the country's stability is a sustained long-term effort on the part of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">I would like to pay tribute to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Haiti, to the UNSMIH personnel and to their Governments, for the positive roles they have played and to the United States and Canada for their crucial role in ensuring the success of the Mission so far.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Richardson</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Three years ago, Haiti found itself staring into the abyss. The democratically elected President was living in exile in the United States. The aspirations of the Haitian people to finally achieve political, social and economic reform were snuffed out by a military dictatorship that practised terror throughout the nation, torturing and murdering its political enemies and those Haitians who dared to speak out. Three years later, with the support of the international community, Haiti is taking meaningful strides forward. Today we come together to ensure that this progress continues. If approved, the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) will assist the Haitian people and their Government in building on their notable achievements.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">Furthering the work of its predecessors, this Mission will help to professionalize the new Haitian National Police Force. Most of the Haitian National Police officers are under the age of 30. The most seasoned officers have less than two years of on-the-job experience. Since its creation just over two years ago, the Haitian National Police has made great progress. However, if we are to help Haiti to develop durable democratic institutions, the international community must continue to guide this young and inexperienced force.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">Since 1994 the Haitian people have achieved much. They have held six free and fair elections. For the first time in Haitian history, one popularly elected President peacefully succeeded another. As never before, an elected Parliament now plays a prominent role in Haitian democracy. Haiti's economy is showing signs of recovery from years of decline.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">Despite these advances, obstacles remain. Some in Haiti even seek to reverse the progress of the Haitian people towards a democratic way of life. Haiti's long-neglected judicial system also needs help. Progress is being made in this area, but much needs to be done. The creation of UNTMIH will further bolster the rule of law, development, democratization and peace in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">My Government welcomes the continued support for Haiti that the adoption of this draft resolution will signify. The international community is devoting considerable resources to help build the foundations for a stable, open and democratic society in Haiti. Our actions today give the Haitian people a chance to create a future of enduring freedom, justice and prosperity for all its people.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Sweden.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Sweden welcomes the decision to be taken today to establish a transitional United Nations Mission of civilian police, supported by a small military element, to assist the Haitian Government in the professionalization of its National Police.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">The Haitian Government has made important efforts to reinforce the rule of law and improve the situation of human rights in the country. At the same time, we share the assessment that international support will still be needed for some time, in order for the Haitian National Police to be able to fulfil its role in the consolidation of justice and democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The United Nations involvement in Haiti provides constructive examples of the multitude of essential functions performed by United Nations civilian police, and of their important role in contributing to the building of confidence and a secure and stable environment. However, security does not only entail maintaining law and order. It also requires a fair legal system, efficient democratic institutions, popular participation and the promotion of sustainable economic development as preconditions for social stability.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">It should be stressed that the main responsibility for Haiti's development lies with the Haitians themselves. The international community can only support the country in its endeavours to consolidate a democratic society and achieve development for all. In order for us to succeed in our efforts, it is essential that the combined capacity of the United Nations system be utilized. Sweden therefore welcomes the intention of the Secretary-General to present further recommendations on the modalities for future international assistance to Haiti.</p>
