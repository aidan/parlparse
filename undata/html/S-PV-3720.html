	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">At the outset of our meeting, I wish to express, on behalf of all members of the Security Council, our most sincere thanks and congratulations to Ambassador Wisnumurti of Indonesia, who presided over the work of the Council during the month of November in a most exemplary and distinguished way. The wisdom, savoir-faire and diplomacy he exercised in steering complex issues in the Council showed us why he enjoys such high esteem and appreciation in his country, in New York and in the whole international community. The outstanding leadership and professional skill of Ambassador Wisnumurti and his collaborators were a major asset to the work of the Council and set an example that I and my delegation will try to follow during the current month of December.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council warmly welcomes the Peace Agreement signed by the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front in Abidjan on 30 November 1996. The Agreement brings to an end a bitter conflict which has caused appalling suffering to the people of Sierra Leone. The Council pays tribute to the courage and determination of all those who have worked tirelessly towards this end. The Council hopes that the Agreement will provide encouragement to those working for peace in other parts of Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council commends in particular the role played by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire whose commitment and determination in the chairmanship of the negotiations between the parties have been crucial to this successful outcome. The Council also pays tribute to the support provided to the negotiations by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General in close coordination with the Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth, the Economic Community of West African States and other organizations and neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council continues to follow developments in Sierra Leone with close interest. The Peace Agreement is an essential first step towards national reconciliation and reconstruction. The Council will continue to support the development of peace and democracy in Sierra Leone. It notes in particular the need for a successful process of demobilization and reintegration of former combatants and stands ready to assist in this process. It stresses the importance of a coordinated international effort to alleviate the humanitarian situation in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to monitor the situation in Sierra Leone and to keep the Council informed of further significant developments."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1996-46.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1996/46</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
