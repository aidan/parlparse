	Mr. Martirosyan (Armenia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">We are facing a situation today where an attempt is being made to introduce a new agenda item, using procedural loopholes and under the pretext of urgency, in the absence of factual evidence.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Committee, despite the fact that a number of General Committee members objected to the inclusion of that item based on valid concerns for the integrity of the peace process, was forced to take a vote at the demand of Azerbaijan, thus breaking a several-decades-long tradition of consensus in the General Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">Those representatives who spoke in the Committee in favour of Azerbaijan's proposal, all representing the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), supported the request based on their membership in that respected organization. However, I would like to emphasize that the Nagorny Karabakh conflict has no religious connotations. Attempts by Azerbaijan to artificially add a religious dimension to a political conflict are inadmissible and dangerous.</div>
	<div class="p">My country has always believed in, and acted in the spirit of, the dialogue among civilizations. As one of the oldest Christian nations, we have made our own modest contribution to the promotion of that dialogue by strengthening our centuries-old friendly ties with many Muslim nations.</div>
	<div class="p">We are thankful to those OIC members who made their judgement based on the specificities of the situation. I should like to appeal to those OIC members present in this Hall to consider the issue from the perspective of its substance, roots and causes, rather than on the basis of religious affiliation.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me highlight several key points that I believe are crucial in the consideration of this issue. First, there is no urgent situation that could justify the Azerbaijanis' request to include a new item in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. The memorandum attached to the Azerbaijani request provides no factual information of any kind and is certainly not of any urgent character. On the contrary, the reasons offered to justify the request are totally fabricated and misrepresent the actual situation on the ground.</div>
	<div class="p">The former autonomous region of Nagorny Karabakh has always been, and continues to be, Armenian-populated. There has therefore been no change in the demographic situation there. As far as the so-called settlements are concerned, there is no official policy of any kind by any official body to settle the territories that came under the control of local Armenian forces.</div>
	<div class="p">This conflict has created refugees on both sides. Before the conflict began, according to the last Soviet Azerbaijani census, there were more than 400,000 Armenians living in Azerbaijan's major cities, far from the fighting. There were all forcibly driven out of their homes and became refugees.</div>
	<div class="p">There are no Armenians in Azerbaijan today. They became refugees and were given the chance to return to Nagorny Karabakh proper -- and only Karabakh, which has always been overwhelmingly Armenian.</div>
	<div class="p">The Azerbaijani Government can make all sorts of accusations and can try to make use of the word "settlement", which is loaded with connotations related to other conflicts. But they are alone in that exercise. No observer, rapporteur or official -- no one -- who has been to the region has raised the issue of illegal settlements.</div>
	<div class="p">As for the territories surrounding Nagorny Karabakh, they have come under the control of Nagorny Karabakh Armenians as a result of the war unleashed by Azerbaijan in an attempt to stifle the peaceful efforts of the people of Nagorny Karabakh to achieve self-determination. Today, Azerbaijan is trying to sell itself as a victim in the eyes of the international community. But it is a victim of the aggressive policies and actions carried out by its own Government.</div>
	<div class="p">The people of Nagorny Karabakh responded to the military onslaught in the same way as any other people would: they defended their lives, their families, their homes and their land. At present, those territories --</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have not yet finished my statement. I ask for permission to complete it.</div>
	<div class="p">Those territories currently serve as a buffer zone between Nagorny Karabakh and Armenia, since the conflict has not yet been settled. A 10-year self-maintained ceasefire is holding, without a single peacekeeper on the ground separating the conflicting forces. The ceasefire is holding because of the military balance, an indispensable component of which are territories. There is regular monthly monitoring by the Personal Representative of the current Chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and his team. His reports are presented to the broad OIC membership. No incident or event of an urgent character that would constitute a dangerous development has been observed or reported.</div>
	<div class="p">The Nagorny Karabakh peace process has picked up some speed over the past year. The package of issues under consideration covers the status of Nagorny Karabakh, security arrangements, territories, refugees and internally displaced persons, communications and the lifting of the blockade. None of these tough, complex problems can be considered and finally resolved individually -- separate from the package. Experience of the peace negotiations within the Minsk Group from 1990 to 1997 explicitly demonstrated that it will be impossible to reach a final agreement on issues of mutual withdrawal from the territories in the absence of a clear understanding on the final status of Nagorny Karabakh.</div>
	<div class="p">The current attempts by Azerbaijan amount to the creation of a parallel process, which would be damaging to the prospects for peace and the resolution of the conflict. Armenia is committed to the negotiations within the Minsk Group and stands ready to work constructively with the co-Chairmen towards a comprehensive solution to the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. At the same time, I am authorized to state that if Azerbaijan separates individual components from the comprehensive package, it should negotiate those components directly with Nagorny Karabakh. That would be in accordance with various Security Council resolutions that Azerbaijan tends to refer to selectively, without itself complying with the provisions.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to ask all Member States to take action against the request by Azerbaijan for the inclusion of this new agenda item.</div>
	<div class="p">Two days ago, while concluding the meeting of the General Committee, you, Sir, announced that the agenda item would be considered under the heading "Maintenance of international peace and security". That is exactly the perspective from which we need to look at this issue and make our judgement. The argument of urgency was brought up for the inclusion of a new agenda item. Yet there was no factual justification presented. During the past several days we heard the argument that this is a procedural issue. Yet this so-called procedural issue may endanger the peace process, threatening the relative peace and stability in the region, as explicitly acknowledged by several delegations. In the face of this potential danger, I cannot but pose this question to the General Assembly: who is going to bear the responsibility for the possible implications of such so-called procedural issues?</div>

	<div class="p">I would like first of all to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the fact that the statement by the Armenian Ambassador has now clearly demonstrated that there is a major, acute problem between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and it should be treated properly by this House.</div>
	<div class="p">Another accusation was made with regard to the countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). I would like to remind our Armenian colleague that the OIC is not a religious, but a political organization, represented and respected across a broad cultural and geographical spectrum.</div>
	<div class="p">The day before yesterday, the General Committee decided to recommend, with no objection -- I underline the fact that there was no objection -- to the General Assembly that the item entitled "The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan" be included in the agenda of this session. That decision by the General Committee reconfirms that Azerbaijan's request is legitimate and fully in line with the Charter, in particular with paragraph 2 of Article 11, in accordance with which the General Assembly may discuss any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations, as well as Article 14, in accordance with which the General Assembly may recommend measures for the adjustment of any situation, regardless of its origin, which it deems likely to impair the general welfare or friendly relations among nations.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly is the chief deliberative, policy-making and representative organ of the United Nations. The very purpose of this house, as designed by its founders, is to serve as a forum for open debate and discussion on any issue. The Charter gives us, like any other Member State, the right to raise questions of vital importance to the security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country. We are ready for open debate and discussion and believe no one has anything to hide. This delegation is certain that each and every member of the United Nations has the right to speak out and to be heard. Otherwise, what is the sense of being a member of the United Nations? We are convinced that the General Assembly, upholding the letter and the spirit of the United Nations Charter, will approve the General Committee's recommendation contained in paragraph four of document <a href="../pdf/A-59-250-Add.3">A/59/250/Add.3</a>.</div>

	<div class="p">When the issue of the inclusion of an additional item on the agenda of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, entitled "The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan", was discussed in the General Committee only two days ago, no member of the Committee, nor any other member who took the floor, objected to the right of a Member State to raise before this Assembly matters relating to the maintenance of peace and security. That was the underlying reasoning of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) from the very start.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community is aware that the situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan has not shown any progress for more than 10 years now. We within the OIC, like other interested parties, also support the efforts of the Minsk Group, and especially the Prague Process, aimed at a peaceful resolution of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.</div>
	<div class="p">However, unless we achieve due awareness in international public opinion of the frustration felt by those who, on a daily basis, still have to go through the strain caused by that long-standing conflict, we will risk relegating the issue, as well, to the realm of so-called frozen conflicts.</div>
	<div class="p">It is time, therefore, that the General Assembly address this issue in earnest in the framework of the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, which emphasize the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. By doing so, we will also remain true to the spirit and letter of the relevant articles of our Charter, which accords to us certain responsibilities in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p">We sincerely hope that an honest, open and forthcoming debate of this issue will serve the cause of a just and viable settlement of this conflict, which has beleaguered the region for many years, so that all the peoples of the region can begin to look forward to mutual understanding, cooperation and shared achievements in this new century.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Azerbaijan has requested the inclusion of a new agenda item entitled "The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan", in the agenda of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Pakistan believes that any Member State has the right to request consideration of an issue that it deems important. The Charter specifically provides, under paragraph 2 of Article 11, that the General Assembly, "may discuss any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security brought before it by any Member of the United Nations". And article 14 provides that the General Assembly may recommend measures for the peaceful adjustment of any situation, regardless of origin, which it deems likely to impair the general welfare or friendly relations among nations. Thus, the General Assembly has the Charter-granted responsibility to consider such issues.</div>
	<div class="p">On 27 October, the General Committee decided and recommended that this issue be included in the agenda of the General Assembly's current session. According to our understanding, it is the General Committee's prerogative to decide on the procedure to be followed. While we feel that the procedural issue has already been decided by the General Committee, the General Assembly may also endorse the decision of the General Committee. Pakistan supports the inclusion of this agenda item on the agenda of the fifty-ninth session.</div>

	<div class="p">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia, the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Bosnia and Herzegovina, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, and the European Free Trade Association countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p">As members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the countries of the European Union support the continuous efforts of the Minsk Group toward a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The recent meetings between the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan, which took place regularly in Prague this year, have lead to productive discussions. Those discussions have given a strong impetus to the negotiations. In September in Astana, the Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group presented to the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan their assessment of the situation and a road map for the continuation of negotiations. They are now awaiting a reply.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union countries are of the opinion that such a promising process, which is being handled within the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, should be allowed to develop without interference. We understand the concerns of the delegation of Azerbaijan, but we believe that this session is neither the time, nor the venue, to pursue this, and that the Azerbaijan initiative may jeopardize the ongoing negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p">There was no unanimity in the General Committee on the inclusion of the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh on the agenda, and the European Union would have preferred that the issue had not been voted for recommendation to the General Assembly. However, in light of all those considerations, the European Union will abstain on the vote on this agenda item.</div>

	Mr. Duclos (France)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Indeed many speakers have referred to the Minsk Group and I think it is quite legitimate and desirable from the point of view of the members of this Assembly that the position of the Chairs of the Minsk Group be stated, and so I am speaking on behalf of them, that is, on behalf of the Russian Federation, the United States and France. However, I have confined my comments to the following procedural points.</div>
	<div class="p">First, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is dealing with this question and has been doing so for a long time. It has been doing so in a serious-minded and active manner, particularly within the Minsk Group. I will refer to one example. The Minsk Group recently took the initiative of holding the Prague Process. The Prague Process consists of meetings between the Foreign Ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia, which has already lead to productive discussions between the parties.</div>
	<div class="p">At the Astana meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States a month ago, the Minsk Group proposed an assessment of the situation and is awaiting comments from the parties. Today, Azerbaijan has voiced specific concerns regarding the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. We believe that those concerns can be fully addressed within the format and according to the procedures that already exist.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, the introduction of a new item on the agenda of the General Assembly could have two negative consequences. First, in light of the situation that we have described, it would be harmful to efforts to find a just, lasting settlement to that problem, particularly at this juncture. Secondly, it would make it impossible to obtain consensus and could therefore be counterproductive. We suggest that we avoid creating such a situation.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, we have no doubt as to the sincerity of the delegation of Azerbaijan when it states its concerns, but we do not believe that this session of the General Assembly is the right time or the right forum to assume this task.</div>
	<div class="p">Fourthly, we urge the parties to consider the possibility of a fact-finding mission of the OSCE as one option for addressing this question.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, again from a procedural perspective, we are not convinced that this question meets the criteria of urgency and importance, as spelled out in Article 15.</div>

	<div class="p">Allow me to express my disappointment over the decision of the General Committee to recommend that the Assembly split its consideration of agenda item 36, on the situation in the Middle East, and item 37 on the question of Palestine, which had been scheduled, according to a previous decision, to be considered jointly. Progress demands efficiency and this is simply not a decision built on efficiency.</div>
	<div class="p">Just a few weeks ago, this Assembly held a joint debate on agenda item 52, "Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly", and agenda item 54, "Strengthening of the United Nations system". Those initiatives, as well as others, such as those set out in the Millennium Declaration, call for a more efficient approach to our work whereby redundancies and duplicate processes are eliminated. As the Secretary-General wrote in "Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change", the General Assembly</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"considers far too many overlapping items, and with a frequency that is often not merited" (<i><a href="../pdf/A-57-387">A/57/387</a>, para. 16</i>).</div>
	<div class="p">Great improvements are possible, however, if duplicative items can be combined and closely-related issues clustered into a single discussion, leading to outcomes of greater policy relevance and impact.</div>
	<div class="p">In many areas, those goals are being implemented. For example, it was an efficient decision this year to jointly consider agenda item 11, "Report of the Security Council", and agenda item 53, "Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and related matters". It is unfortunate, however, that one of the only subjects that is immune from streamlining, revitalization and reform is the Arab-Israeli conflict. A total of 20 General Assembly meetings were devoted to Israel at the fifty-eighth session. By way of contrast, none was devoted to world hunger and only two were devoted to HIV/AIDS. That does not do the credibility and reputation of the United Nations any good, nor does it help the General Assembly to play a constructive role in world affairs, including in the Middle East.</div>
	<div class="p">As we have amply demonstrated over the years, we are quite willing to debate the issues presented by our region's difficult situation. At least by streamlining the debate, however, we could have addressed the issues in a more determined, more serious and more effective manner. It is for that reason that we believe the decision of the General Committee is imprudent and contrary to the goals of revitalization and reform that should guide the work of this body in all its aspects. Rather than break the consensus, however, we merely dissociate ourselves from this decision.</div>
