<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mehdiyev</span> <span class="nation">Azerbaijan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">I have the honour to introduce, on behalf of the sponsors, including Sweden, which has joined that group very recently, <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.41-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.41/Rev.1</a>. The text before us is the result of an extensive process of informal consultations reflecting our willingness to attain broad support for the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">The draft resolution primarily focuses on the issues of transparency and accountability in industries, recognizing the important role of the international community, Government and the private sector in that regard. It also takes note of relevant voluntary initiatives implemented in this field, in particular the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which seeks to further strengthen transparency and accountability in the extractive sector.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">Launched in 2003, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is a voluntary initiative open to all countries looking for better standards of transparency and accountability in the extractive sector to the benefit of their peoples. Bringing together Government, the private sector and civil society, the EITI enables more transparent and accountable governance in the extractive sector, while aligning the interests of all stakeholders.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">We believe that the adoption of this draft resolution will be another important step for countries to further promote transparency and accountability. We also believe that this kind of recognition should facilitate the exchange of lessons learned and the sharing of knowledge and best practices through South-South and North-South cooperation, which will be important in developing the transparency agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">We believe that the United Nations system, through its global reach, country presence and areas of work, will be an important partner for increasing knowledge about transparency and for assisting those countries that want to develop capacities in developing initiatives such as the EITI. Therefore, we invite all member States to adopt the draft resolution by consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">In conclusion, I wish to thank all the sponsors of the draft resolution for their contribution and support, and also to thank those delegations that participated in the harmonization of the text.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The title in Spanish should conform to the English text, "Strengthening transparency in industries", with the word "industries" in the plural. The sixth preambular paragraph too should conform to the English text, which reads "Taking note of all relevant voluntary initiatives, including the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, aimed at improving transparency in the extractive industries".</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">We also request that footnote 3, which refers to the website of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, be deleted. It is our understanding that footnotes are used to refer to official documents of the United Nations, and the decision to include this footnote was not a consensus-based decision among Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Finally, we request that the Spanish text of paragraph 4 be corrected to conform to the English text, which reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">"Notes the efforts of countries that are participating in all relevant voluntary initiatives to improve transparency and accountability in industries, including in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in the extractive sector, and to share their experience with interested Member States."</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Liu Yuyin</span> <span class="nation">China</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">I, too, wish to point out some problems with the Chinese version of <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.41-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.41/Rev.1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">First, with regard to the title of the draft resolution, the Chinese version, when translated back into English literally, is "Strengthening transparency in industries and business". There is a similar problem in operative paragraph 4. I understand that in Chinese there is no word corresponding to the word "industries", but I trust that the translators have the wisdom to find a perfect Chinese word for "industries". Also in operative paragraph 4, in the Chinese version, when translated back into English literally, it would seem that the comma has been omitted after the word "initiatives".</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">So, I would ask the Secretariat to pay heed to the problems with the Chinese version and make the corresponding corrections.</p>

If translated into English, it would read: "Strengthening transparency in the extractive industry". During the negotiations on the draft resolution we tried to achieve consensus, and the consensus was reached with the understanding that the title of the draft resolution in Russian would not include the word "extractive".</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk05-pa02">I would like my comments to be carefully applied to the entire Russian text of the draft resolution in order to eliminate such glaring inaccuracies.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hagen</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk09-pa01">We are particularly pleased that <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-274.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 62/274</a> takes note of the role of voluntary initiatives, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, in strengthening transparency and accountability in industries. Azerbaijan is one of the pioneers in implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and we are grateful for its sponsorship of this resolution. We encourage other emerging economies and their companies to support the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk09-pa02">With respect to the reference in the fifth preambular paragraph to full permanent sovereignty over wealth, natural resources and economic activities, and the reference in the fourth preambular paragraph to Assembly resolution 1803 (XVII) of 14 December 1962, the United States wishes to emphasize that State sovereignty is qualified by rules of international law, including those concerning expropriation of property. For example, no State may expropriate or nationalize foreign investments, either directly or indirectly, except when four conditions are met. In particular, an expropriation must be for a public purpose; it must be non-discriminatory; it must be accompanied by prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and it must be carried out in accordance with due process of law.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has joined consensus on <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.41-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.41/Rev.1</a>, taking into account the changes mentioned earlier, and wishes to make the following comments.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">We should like to underscore our concern at the trend for the Assembly to attempt to give an intergovernmental stimulus to non-intergovernmental initiatives. Here, we wish to stress that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela considers that the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, as indicated in operative paragraph 4, is voluntary and that it falls within the context of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, adopted by the Assembly as resolution 3281 (XXIX). That document states that every State has full permanent sovereignty, including possession, use and disposal, over all its wealth, natural resources and economic activities.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Similarly, transparency and/or accountability in industries is interpreted as being aimed at enhancing social well-being, inclusion, participation and accountability to the people, in full conformity with the national legislation of States. However, in no way can this transparency and/or accountability mean the establishment of supranational monitoring mechanisms that undermine a State's full permanent sovereignty, including possession, use and disposal, over all its wealth, natural resources and economic activities.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">With respect to paragraph 3, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela interprets the role of the international community as solely to strengthen the sovereignty of the State over its industries and over the use and disposal of its natural resources. The purpose is to increase the State's efforts to attain its development goals, to include internationally agreed goals and the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">As regards paragraph 6, it is understood to mean that transnational corporations should fully comply with national legislation in the places where their activities take place and should cooperate with the development strategies of the States in which their activities take place.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">In conclusion, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela believes that this resolution will promote increased transparency in all international industrial, financial and trade sectors and will be an effective means of meeting commitments under the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the relevant resolutions.</p>

The synergy between Africa's economic and social development programmes and its peace and security agenda should also be developed.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk08-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk08-pa02">In accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-29.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 62/29</a>, adopted by the General Assembly on 5 December 2007, the Open-ended Working Group to Consider the Objectives and Agenda, including the possible establishment of the preparatory committee, for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament (SSOD IV) was to hold an organizational session in order to set a date for its substantive session in 2008 and to submit a report on its work, including possible substantive recommendations, before the end of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk08-pa03">However, noting that the Open-ended Working Group could not be convened within the time allocated -- namely, within the sixty-second session of the General Assembly -- owing to the unavailability of a Chair for the Group, we deemed it necessary to propose a procedural decision. Following informal consultations with delegations, and for the purpose of reporting to the General Assembly before the end of the sixty-second session, as requested by the resolution, we are introducing the draft decision contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.49.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/L.49</a> for consideration and adoption by the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk08-pa04">NAM sees SSOD IV as a useful platform for promoting multilateral negotiations on disarmament and arms limitation measures. Its convening will also reaffirm multilateralism as the core principle in negotiations and strengthen the central role of the United Nations in disarmament and related issues. Therefore, I should like to reaffirm NAM's unwavering support for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. At an appropriate time, NAM will request the convening of the Open-ended Working Group.</p>
