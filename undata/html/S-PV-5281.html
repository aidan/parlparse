The Security Council expresses its intention to consider whether to provide additional resources to UNOCI, based on careful study of conditions in the country and of evidence of meaningful progress towards implementation of long-standing commitments under Linas-Marcoussis and other relevant agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms that it endorsed the Linas-Marcoussis, Accra III and Pretoria Agreements, and demands that all the parties signatory to these agreements, as well as all the Ivorian parties concerned, implement fully and without delay their commitments under these agreements, in accordance with the decision of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council welcomes the forthcoming visit of a high-level delegation led by Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Thabo Mbeki to Côte d'Ivoire, expresses its full support to it, and urges all the Ivorian parties to cooperate fully and in good faith with this delegation, in particular in order to ensure the rapid implementation of the decision of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union and the early appointment of a Prime Minister acceptable to all parties, and to guarantee, with the support of the United Nations, the organization of free, fair, open, transparent and credible elections.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the forthcoming visit to the region of the Chair of the Sanctions Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1572(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1572 (2004)</a>, and underlines that the purpose of this visit is to assess the progress made by all parties towards the implementation of their commitments, bearing in mind the Committee's mandate under paragraphs 9 and 11 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1572(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1572 (2004)</a>, and to remind all Ivorian parties of their responsibilities for the full and rapid implementation of the peace process."</p>
