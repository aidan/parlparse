<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Cho</span><span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA53PV100-pg002-bk03-pa01">We have asked for the floor to explain our position on the decision just adopted on the important issue of financing for East Timor.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV100-pg002-bk03-pa02">The Republic of Korea has supported all efforts to bring a peaceful solution to the question of East Timor. We welcomed the signing of the agreement on the future of East Timor, concluded in May 1999 between the Governments of Indonesia and Portugal, as well as the other two supplementary agreements between the United Nations and the two Governments.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV100-pg002-bk03-pa03">We commend the efforts made over the last 16 years by the Secretariat, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, to find a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question. We believe the agreements of 5 May 1999, as a major breakthrough in the peace process, will serve to consolidate peace in East Timor. To make the most of this opportunity, we believe also that it is now incumbent upon the international community to make the necessary resources and manpower available for the successful implementation of the agreements.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV100-pg002-bk03-pa04">But the tasks facing the international community are many and very challenging. One crucial concern is the security situation in East Timor. We believe it is the minimum condition for the holding of a free and fair ballot in early August 1999.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV100-pg002-bk03-pa05">Given the short time available until the ballot, it is of the utmost important that the Secretary-General be enabled to start the action required for early deployment of the United Nations mission in East Timor, including civilian police. In consideration of these factors, my delegation supported the recommendation contained in paragraph 7 of document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-53-485-Add.3.pdf">A/53/485/Add.3</a>, by which the Assembly has decided at this stage to grant the Secretary-General the authority to enter into commitment up to $35 million.</p>
