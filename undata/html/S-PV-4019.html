<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the question of East Timor, <a href="../pdf/S-1999-705.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/705</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the question of East Timor of 22 June 1999 (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-705.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/705</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council notes with understanding the Secretary-General's decision to postpone for three weeks his determination, which he will base on the main elements identified in his report of 5 May (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-513.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/513</a>), of whether the necessary security situation exists for the start of the operational phase of the consultation process in accordance with the Agreement between the United Nations and the Governments of Indonesia and Portugal (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-513.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/513</a>, annex III). The Council also endorses his intention that the operational phases of the popular consultation not begin until the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) is fully deployed, and his decision to postpone the ballot date for two weeks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council emphasizes that a popular consultation of the East Timorese people through a direct, secret and universal ballot represents an historic opportunity to resolve the question of East Timor peacefully. It concurs with the Secretary-General's assessment that this process must be transparent and that all parties must have the opportunity to express themselves freely.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"In this regard the Security Council expresses serious concern that the Secretary-General, in his assessment, concludes that the necessary conditions do not yet exist to begin the operational phases of the consultation process, given the security situation throughout much of East Timor and the absence of a level playing field'. It is especially concerned that the militias and other armed groups have carried out acts of violence against the local population and exercise an intimidating influence over them, and that these activities continue to constrict political freedom in East Timor, thus jeopardizing the necessary openness of the consultation process. The Council notes the Secretary-General's assessment that while the security situation has severely limited the opportunity for public expression by pro-independence activists, pro-autonomy campaigning has been actively pursued.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council stresses the need for all sides to put an end to all kinds of violence and for utmost restraint before, during and after the consultation. It calls on UNAMET to follow up reports of violent activity by both the pro-integration militias and Falintil. In this regard, it expresses grave concern at the attack on the UNAMET office in Maliana, East Timor, on 29 June 1999. The Council demands that the incident be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators be brought to justice. The Council also demands that all parties respect the safety and security of UNAMET personnel. The Security Council supports the statement of the Spokesman for the Secretary-General of 29 June 1999 and requests the Secretary-General to report further.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council welcomes the positive developments identified by the Secretary-General. The Council warmly welcomes the excellent channels of communication between UNAMET and the Indonesian authorities which have been facilitated by the establishment of a high-level Indonesian task force in Dili. The Council warmly welcomes the opening of the DARE II talks in Jakarta with representatives of all sides in East Timor and the progress towards making the Commission on Peace and Stability operative.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council stresses once again the responsibility of the Government of Indonesia to maintain peace and security in East Timor. The Council emphasizes that all local officials in East Timor must abide by the provisions of the Tripartite Agreements (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-513.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/513</a>, annexes I-III), in particular as regards the designated campaign period, the use of public funds for campaign purposes and the need to campaign only in their private capacity, without recourse to the pressure of office.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council is particularly concerned at the situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in East Timor and the implications which this may have for the universality of the consultation. It calls on all concerned to grant full access and freedom of movement to humanitarian organizations for the delivery of humanitarian assistance, to cease immediately activities which may cause further displacement and to allow all IDPs who wish to do so to return home.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council notes that full deployment of UNAMET will not be possible before 10 July 1999. It urges the Secretary-General to take all necessary steps to ensure full deployment by that time, and urges all parties to cooperate fully with UNAMET. It stresses the importance of allowing complete freedom of movement for UNAMET within East Timor in order to carry out its tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council urges the Indonesian Government and the pro-integration and pro-independence groups to continue to enhance cooperation with UNAMET, to allow the popular consultation to go ahead in a timely manner.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council will remained seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">This statement will be issued as document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1999-20.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1999/20</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
