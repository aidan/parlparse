	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">This afternoon, before turning to the item before the General Assembly, I should like to say a few words about the commemoration of the Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories, which is to be observed at the United Nations tomorrow, 25 May.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">The achievements of the United Nations in decolonization represent an important contribution to a world of peace, in which fundamental human rights and the dignity of the human person are respected and affirmed and in which social progress and better standards of life are promoted.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The decolonization process has had a significant impact on the history of the twentieth century. Since 1946, when the first list of Non-Self-Governing Territories at the United Nations numbered 72, over 60 colonial Territories have exercised their right to self-determination and attained independence, taking their rightful place in the community of sovereign nations, many of them as Members of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">And yet the process is not over. Seventeen Non-Self-Governing Territories remain under the consideration of this Assembly, and, in particular, under the careful scrutiny of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which, since its establishment in 1961, has closely monitored progress in the implementation of the Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">On this day, we reiterate the commitment of the United Nations to the Non-Self-Governing Territories to ensure that the decisions the world body has taken on their behalf, with a view to safeguarding the interests of the Territories, are fulfilled. On this occasion, we also reiterate our appeal for the cooperation of the administering Powers with the Special Committee in the implementation of General Assembly resolutions and call on programmes and institutions of the United Nations to assist the Non-Self-Governing Territories in enhancing their standard of living and promoting their self-sufficiency.</p>
