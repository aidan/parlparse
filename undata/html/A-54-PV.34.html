	The meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.
</div>

<div class="boldline" id="1-2">
	<div class="p">Tribute to the memory of the first President of the United Republic of Tanzania, His Excellency Mr. Julius Nyerere, and the staff members of the United Nations killed in Kosovo and Burundi</div>
</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">It is with deep personal sadness that I learned of the passing of Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, first President of the United Republic of Tanzania, a venerable world leader and one of Africa's most charismatic and respected elder statesmen. He died overnight in London at the age of 77 after suffering from leukaemia.</div>
	<div class="p">President Nyerere's life was legendary. Born in 1922 in a village near Lake Victoria, he entered politics in 1954, founding the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), and the campaign for independence from colonial rule. He became Chief Minister of British-ruled Tanganyika in 1960. He then led his country to independence in 1961, serving first as Prime Minister and, from 1964, as President of the United Republic of Tanzania.</div>
	<div class="p">Mwalimu was the pillar of his nation's politics and a mediator whose wise counsel other world leaders sought. He stepped down voluntarily in 1985, one of a very few African leaders of his generation to do so.</div>
	<div class="p">I, too, was a beneficiary of Mwalimu's political tutelage and of Tanzania's generosity. They provided me with a free haven when I fled my own country, Namibia, in 1962 to escape South Africa's brutal apartheid colonialism in Namibia.</div>
	<div class="p">The Tanzanian people have lost the father of their nation, the courageous leader of their independence struggle and the architect of the United Republic of Tanzania. The African people as a whole have lost an ardent pan-Africanist, a man of high principles, a man of self-abnegation and a champion of African self-determination, liberation and independence. Without Mr. Nyerere's firm guidance and steadfast support, the struggle for liberation, particularly in southern Africa, would have been even more difficult and divisive within the ranks of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Non-Aligned Movement and other freedom-loving forces in the world. Mwalimu was the force behind the southern African front-line States and their foremost strategist and intellectual mentor.</div>
	<div class="p">Mwalimu's contributions to public life did not end with his retirement from office. He served as Chairman of the South Commission from 1987 to 1990 and was later named Honorary Chairman of the intergovernmental South Centre, which promotes South-South cooperation and solidarity.</div>
	<div class="p">At the time of his death, President Nyerere was serving as chief mediator in the negotiations to end the civil war in Burundi. He devoted much of his time to seeking African solutions to African problems, working diligently to promote African unity.</div>
	<div class="p">On behalf of the General Assembly and in my own personal capacity, I extend heartfelt condolences to his bereaved family and to the courageous people of Tanzania at the passing of their founding father and extraordinary leader.</div>
	<div class="p">It is also my sad duty to pay tribute to the memory of the staff members of the United Nations who were recently killed in Kosovo and Burundi in the line of duty.</div>
	<div class="p">Once again, United Nations staff members have paid the ultimate price in the line of duty. They sacrificed their lives in Kosovo and Burundi while serving the cause of peace. The loss of three staff members within a 24-hour period underscores the often difficult and dangerous conditions under which United Nations personnel serve.</div>
	<div class="p">The deaths of Valentin Krumov in Kosovo and of Luis Zuniga and Saskia von Meijenfeldt in Burundi bring to 13 the number of civilian staff killed this year alone in the field of operations. This saddening statistic indicates a sharp increase in attacks on United Nations personnel and calls for effective measures by Governments, and particularly parties in conflict situations, to ensure the safety and security of United Nations personnel and other humanitarian workers.</div>
	<div class="p">I strongly condemn these wanton acts of brutality against peacemakers and peace workers and call upon the international community to assist the United Nations in further intensifying public education with the view to putting an end to the loss of innocent lives.</div>
	<div class="p">In Kosovo, on Monday evening, Mr. Valentin Krumov, a 38- year-old Bulgarian national, was brutally assaulted by a crowd and then shot dead on a street in Pristina. Mr. Krumov had just arrived in that city to take up his assignment with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). He became UNMIK's first casualty. An eyewitness reported that he was shot after replying in Serbian when asked for the time.</div>
	<div class="p">In Burundi, on 12 October, Mr. Luis Zuniga, a 52-year-old Chilean national and a representative of the United Nations Children's Fund, and Ms. Saskia von Meijenfeldt, a 34-year-old Dutch national and a logistics officer with the World Food Programme, were killed in a road ambush. They were part of an inter-agency team that was carrying out an assessment of humanitarian needs in a camp for displaced persons. Seven Burundian nationals also lost their lives and several others were seriously injured in that terrible tragedy.</div>
	<div class="p">Justice demands that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes be apprehended and prosecuted. Such criminal acts committed within the territory of a Member State must not go unpunished. While many such incidents are carried out by lawless elements outside the control of Governments, Member States can and must play a decisive role by ensuring scrupulous adherence to international humanitarian law instruments, including the relevant conventions. The 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, which entered into force this year, establishes the legal framework for protecting United Nations staff members in situations of armed conflict.</div>
	<div class="p">Today, we mourn the untimely deaths of staff members whose loyalty and commitment to the noble ideals of the United Nations remained unflinching to their last breath. In this hour of sorrow and bereavement, I commend the courage and dedication of those who faithfully put their lives on the line in the service of the United Nations and of humanity. It was with this in mind that I told United Nations personnel last month, on the occasion of the Millennium Staff Day, "You are the lifeblood of the United Nations". For whenever a staff member is killed in the line of duty, all of us bleed. We must ensure the safety and security of those who carry the United Nations flag, especially staff members in the field in peacekeeping missions or at United Nations outposts throughout the world.</div>
	<div class="p">On behalf of the General Assembly, I extend our deepest condolences and heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved families and friends of those who lost their lives in the cause of peace. Let us today pledge, individually and collectively, to do all in our power to stem the tide of violence that destroys hope and impedes peacekeeping and peace enforcement in the world.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">I call now on the Deputy Secretary-General.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The Deputy Secretary-General: </b>Let me start, Mr. President, by joining you in paying homage to Julius Nyerere, the founder and first President of the United Republic of Tanzania, an architect of the Organization of African Unity and one of the giants of the twentieth-century African liberation movement. He was <i>Mwalimu</i>, or Teacher, to us all, and his death takes from us a good friend and a tireless supporter of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">As I address the General Assembly this morning, the following scenes are unfolding elsewhere: the family of Valentin Krumov of Bulgaria is mourning his brutal murder in Pristina on the very day he took up his duties there. The families of Luis Zuniga of Chile and of Saskia von Meijenfeldt of the Netherlands are preparing to bury their loved ones, killed in cold blood while on a mission in Burundi to assess humanitarian needs. And the families of still more United Nations colleagues, held hostage in Georgia, are waiting in anguish for word of their fate.</div>
	<div class="p">Such incidents -- killings, assaults, harassment, kidnappings -- have become far too routine in conflict zones throughout the world. United Nations staff have become targets, not through any fault of their own but because there are those who seek advantage in flouting international humanitarian norms and simple human decency.</div>
	<div class="p">All too often the targeting is deliberate, directed not only against United Nations staff but also against non-governmental organizations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. This is not only wrong; it is depriving the international community of a precious tool with which to relieve the suffering caused by war and humanitarian emergencies.</div>
	<div class="p">Some will say there is little that can be done against hatred and violence. I beg to differ, and I do so in the strongest possible terms. Some things are indeed beyond our control, but much is within it. Member States bear primary responsibility for ensuring the security of United Nations staff. Here are some measures they can take: first, they can conduct vigorous investigations into all such killings and incidents, prosecuting those responsible to the full extent of the law. To our knowledge, only one person has ever been found guilty and has been imprisoned for killing or causing the death of a United Nations staff member. This impunity cannot be allowed to stand.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, those who have not done so already can sign and ratify two conventions. The Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel has come into force at long last, but only 29 nations have ratified it. The Rome Statute for an International Criminal Court, not yet in force, will make it a war crime to attack personnel involved in a humanitarian-assistance or peacekeeping mission pursued in accordance with the United Nations Charter.</div>
	<div class="p">Thirdly, Member States can provide the funding needed to improve staff security. We need more security officers and stress counsellors, and more training. Improved security is not a luxury. It should be viewed, as it would be in any private firm, as an essential operating cost.</div>
	<div class="p">And fourthly, Member States can use their influence over those who control the territories in which these atrocities occur. They can exert more influence over States, or over factions within them, to bring their forces under better control and discipline.</div>
	<div class="p">We all know that risk is part of our jobs. But a desperate irony is developing: Member States are willing to send unarmed civilians into places where they will not send well armed soldiers. As the Secretary-General has said to them in the past, these are your own citizens who are venturing into peril. Let us consider what more we can do, on an urgent basis, to ensure that they can carry out their vital work in safety. Let us send our prayers to all who are mourning today.</div>
	<div class="p">And let us recognize that if we fail to act there will be more families and friends who will mourn tomorrow, and the day after that. That is not something any of us would wish on any other human being, or want to have on our conscience. So we must prevent it.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The President:</b>I now invite representatives to stand and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of those deceased staff members.</div>
	<div class="blockquote"><i>The members of the General Assembly observed a minute of silence.</i></div>

	<div class="p">May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note of this information?</div>

	<div class="p">In this connection, a new document will be issued tomorrow morning under the symbol <a href="../pdf/A-54-464">A/54/464</a>.</div>

	<div class="p"><b>Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs</b></div>
	<div class="blockquote"><b>(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council</b></div>
	<div class="p"><b>The President: </b>The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1999.</div>
	<div class="p">The five non-permanent outgoing members are the following: Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, the Gambia and Slovenia. These five States cannot be re-elected and therefore their names should not appear on the ballot papers.</div>
	<div class="p">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in the year 2000 the following States: Argentina, Canada, Malaysia, Namibia and the Netherlands. The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot papers.</div>
	<div class="p">Of the five non-permanent members which will remain in office in the year 2000, two are from Africa and Asia, one is from Latin America and the Caribbean and two are from Western European and other States.</div>
	<div class="p">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: three from Africa and Asia, one from Eastern Europe and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the three States to be elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from Africa and one from Asia.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to inform the Assembly that the number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected.</div>
	<div class="p">In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</div>
