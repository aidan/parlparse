	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council strongly commends the efforts of the African Union to achieve lasting peace in Darfur, which have its full support. It reiterates in the strongest terms the need for all parties to the conflict in Darfur to put an immediate end to the violence and atrocities; reaffirms its concern that the persisting violence in Darfur might further negatively affect the rest of the country as well as the region, including the security of Chad; and expresses its utmost concern over the dire consequences of the prolonged conflict in Darfur for the civilian population.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council regrets the decision of the Government of National Unity not to renew the contract of the Norwegian Refugee Council and expresses its grave concern over the humanitarian consequences. It also regrets the decision of the Government of National Unity to deny the entry of the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator to Darfur. It looks forward to the forthcoming briefing by the Emergency Relief Coordinator and to his being able to visit Darfur at the earliest possible opportunity. The Security Council also calls for an explanation from the Government of National Unity of its decision.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the Inter-Sudanese Peace Talks on the Conflict in Darfur in Abuja, noting that an inclusive political settlement is key to peace in the Sudan, that the Talks provide a mechanism to achieve such a settlement and that the African Union should maintain leadership. It welcomes the timely involvement of the Chair of the African Union and the President of Nigeria in the Talks during their visit to Abuja on 8 April; endorses the decision of the African Union Peace and Security Council that 30 April 2006 is the final deadline for reaching an agreement; demands that all parties make the necessary efforts to reach an agreement by this date; and reaffirms its determination to hold accountable those impeding the peace process and committing human rights violations, noting the view of the African Union that the Council has a critical role in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council commends the African Union for what the African Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) has successfully achieved in Darfur despite exceptionally difficult circumstances, and the efforts of Member States and organizations that have assisted AMIS. It reiterates its welcome in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1663(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1663 (2006)</a> of 24 March 2006 of the decision of the African Union Peace and Security Council of 10 March to support in principle the transition of AMIS to a United Nations operation and to extend the mandate of AMIS until 30 September 2006; calls, therefore, on all parties to take all necessary measures to ensure a smooth and successful transfer to a United Nations operation; urges Member States and international and regional organizations to provide additional assistance to AMIS so that it may be strengthened in line with the conclusions of the Joint Assessment Mission report of 10 to 20 December 2005; and calls for the convening of a pledging conference.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of the Sudan, which will be unaffected by the transition to a United Nations operation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council stresses that the Secretary-General should consult jointly with the African Union, in close and continuing consultation with the Security Council and in cooperation and close consultation with the parties to the Abuja Peace Talks, including the Government of National Unity, on decisions concerning the transition; stresses that a United Nations operation will have strong African participation and character; recalls its request in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1663(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1663 (2006)</a> of 24 March 2006 that the Secretary-General expedite the necessary preparatory planning for the transition of AMIS to a United Nations operation; calls in this regard for a United Nations assessment mission to visit Darfur by 30 April 2006; and calls on international and regional organizations and Member States to provide every possible additional assistance to a United Nations operation."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-16.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/16</a>.</p>
