	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">The five outgoing non-permanent members are the following: Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and Ukraine. Those five States cannot be re-elected, and therefore their names should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in 2002 the following States: Colombia, Ireland, Mauritius, Norway and Singapore. The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">Of the five non-permanent members which will remain in office in 2002, two are from Africa and Asia, one is from Latin America and the Caribbean and two are from Western European and other States.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: three from Africa and Asia, one from Eastern Europe and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the three States to be elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from Africa and one from Asia.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa07">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, which receive the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of members present and voting will be declared elected.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa08">In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa09">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>

<div class="italicline" id="pg001-bk04">
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">It was so decided.</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be no nominations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by the Chairmen of the relevant regional groups of the following.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">For the three vacant seats from among the African and Asian States, there are three endorsed candidates: Cameroon, Guinea and the Syrian Arab Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">For the Eastern European States, there are two candidates for one vacant seat: Belarus and Bulgaria.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">As for the Latin American and Caribbean States, there are also two candidates for one vacant seat: the Dominican Republic and Mexico.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa06">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to the election by secret ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa07">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa08">I should like to seek the usual cooperation of representatives during the conduct of the election. I remind representatives that during the voting process all campaigning should cease in the General Assembly Hall. That means, in particular, that once the meeting has begun, no more campaign material may be distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also requested to remain in their seats so that the voting process can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank members for their cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa09">We shall now begin the voting process.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa10">Ballot papers marked "A", "B" and "C" will now be distributed.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa11">I request representatives to use only those ballot papers that have been distributed and to write on them the names of the five States for which they wish to vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa12">A ballot paper containing more names from the relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a ballot paper that do not belong to that region will not be counted.</p>
