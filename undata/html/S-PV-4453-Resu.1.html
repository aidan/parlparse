</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk07">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motomura</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">Allow me to thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this debate on the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and for allowing my Government to present its views on this subject of obvious importance to all of us. May I also express Japan's appreciation to Ambassador Navarrete of Mexico for his outstanding work in the Council. We understand that this formal meeting of the Security Council is the last one he will attend.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Let me also thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, for his informative briefing, as well as for the excellent manner in which he and the other members of the Bureau have been conducting the work of the Committee. In addition, I would like to take this opportunity to express my Government's full support for the Counter-Terrorism Committee's second 90-day work programme, which has been distributed as Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-2002-67.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/67</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Japan agrees with many of the points raised by the previous speakers. Also, as a member of the G-8, the Government of Japan associates itself with the statement made by Ambassador Heinbecker of Canada, which currently holds the chairmanship of the G-8, describing the Group's counter-terrorism activities. However, I would also like to briefly touch upon some aspects of the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee to which Japan attaches particular importance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">I will not repeat Japan's basic position or describe the specific measures it has taken in the fight against terrorism, as these have been presented on various occasions, including Council meetings. I would ask those delegations interested in more detailed information to refer to our report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which is to be published as a Security Council document in due course.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">The fight against terrorism will not be successful unless the overall capability of the international community to respond to and suppress terrorism is upgraded. Thus, of utmost importance is international cooperation to help countries that are willing but unable to improve their counter-terrorism capabilities. From the numerous briefings conducted by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, including his briefing today, we understand that the Counter-Terrorism Committee is of the same view.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">Japan hopes to play an active role in such cooperative efforts. As detailed in its report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, it maintains solid programmes of bilateral assistance, including training programmes in counter-terrorism. Japan is committed to doubling the number of participants in such programmes this year. If the need arises for various forms of assistance during the course of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by Member States, my Government is prepared to consider providing further assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">The activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee experts are critically important in ensuring the smooth implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Government of Japan looks forward to working with the six experts who have already been appointed, and is confident that if its own candidate, Mr. Toshihiko Tanaka, is appointed as a Counter-Terrorism Committee expert, he will make valuable contributions to the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">Before I conclude, allow me to touch upon the situation in Afghanistan. Although the fight against terrorism can by no means be reduced to the single issue of Afghanistan, an important component of that fight is ensuring that Afghanistan is never again used as a safe haven for international terrorists. It is our strong hope that the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan, which Japan is hosting in Tokyo next week with the active participation of the countries and international organizations concerned, will be an important step towards achieving that end by ensuring a stable and prosperous future for Afghanistan.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Japan for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Bangladesh. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chowdhury</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">It is good to be back at this table, and what a pleasure it is to see you, Mr. President, in the Chair. I say the latter with a modicum of pride, which I share with all of your friends, due to the excellent manner in which you are stewarding the Council's proceedings this month.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Let me also express my warm gratitude to you and others for the warm tributes paid to the five of us who have just left the Council, including Bangladesh -- the D-5, or Departed Five, also dubbed recently by the Secretary-General as the E-5, or the Experienced Five.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Sir Jeremy Greenstock has been overseeing the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> most ably. He deserves high praise. Special mention must be made of his endeavours to keep the world beyond the Council apprised.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">For us, there is no room for complacency. The elimination of terrorist threats is a long, drawn out process. We must remain ever vigilant. To deny the terrorists the means, and also the reason, we must focus our attention not just on the breeding grounds but also on the grounds for which they are bred, address not just the effect but also the cause; this is simple logic. Right now, though, the categorical imperative before us is the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, effectively and in its entirety, individually, at the national level, and collectively, at the regional and global levels. In this respect, we endorse Ambassador Greenstock's efforts to keep the Counter-Terrorism Committee's mandate intellectually tight, for this neatness is what is rendering its task effective.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">We have kept the Committee on Counter-Terrorism informed of actions taken within Bangladesh on this count. I shall not recount them, but will mention only a few points. Banks in Bangladesh have reported negatively on accounts of and transactions by any terrorist organizations. All of our borders and bordering areas have been put on high alert for monitoring movements and activities of terrorist organizations or outfits. Internal vigilance has been stepped up. To date, no such activities or movements, including any having international connections, have been detected. Special security measures have been undertaken for the protection of the premises and personnel of diplomatic missions and international organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">At the global level, Bangladesh is a State party to three of the United Nations conventions relating to terrorism, as well as, at the regional level, to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. Our Government is in the process of examining the remaining international instruments with a view to ratification or accession. As a State party to the SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism, Bangladesh has already established a national focal point for exchange of information on terrorist activities within the South Asian countries.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">We take note of Sir Jeremy's comments made just before we broke for lunch today on the positive contribution of peer pressure within our region.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">We have adopted the aforementioned measures despite our many and varied constraints, which are well known. We will need technical support and assistance in strengthening counter-terrorism measures and meeting the objectives of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Such assistance can take the form of support for the modernization of border control and immigration procedures, banking mechanisms, and the computerization and training of personnel in the relevant services. We have just heard of Japan's decision to contribute to some of these aspects. We thank the Japanese delegation for the content of that announcement, as well as for hosting the Tokyo International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">Bangladesh also believes that the exchange of information and coordination of efforts at the regional level will effectively contribute towards combating terrorism. But, most of all, Bangladesh sets great store by the nature of the polity as a means of staving off terrorism. Our country of 130 million is a vibrant democracy engaged in the tasks of poverty alleviation and gender mainstreaming, with faith in the values and institutions of human rights; we see these as the real instruments with which terrorism can be combated.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">Human Rights Watch, in its report released on 16 January, warned that the anti-terrorism campaign is inspiring opportunistic attacks on civil liberties around the world. There is no denying the fact that defeating the fundamental amorality of terrorism requires a firm grounding in the norms and mores of international human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, has also expressed concerns that the international duty to act against terrorism is being used to suppress the legitimate expression of grievances. Her warnings must be based on objective realities. This is fact. These concerns should be taken seriously.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">We have seen in recent days how a long-standing low-intensity conflict could threaten to destabilize regional peace and even international security. We need also to address such conflicts. Analysts once considered Afghanistan a time bomb. We paid little heed. Let us learn from experience.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">Finally, let me recall what Secretary-General Kofi Annan said recently:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg003-bk02-pa14">"The United Nations can provide the forum for building a universal coalition that can ensure global legitimacy for a long-term response to terrorism."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa15">This coalition remains, not just in a military sense, though also that; but also as an alliance of values, of ideas, of resistance against unreason and against violence. Let us continue to preserve that.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Bangladesh for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Belarus. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ling</span> <span class="nation">Belarus</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Allow me to join previous speakers in thanking the Security Council, through you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to participate in the discussion of one of the most important and burning problems of our time. We are convinced that the right time has been chosen to discuss the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The majority of United Nations Member States, including the Republic of Belarus, have already submitted their reports to the Counter-Terrorism Committee, pursuant to paragraph 6 of that resolution. Belarus has been carefully and closely following the current work of the Committee and is grateful to its Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for his activities and his efforts to carry out the activities of the Committee in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue with all the Member States of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">Cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee in the framework of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is one of the priority areas of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism. The timely submission of our national report, in accordance with paragraph 6 of the resolution, is proof of our attitude towards the work of the Committee. Our report is a result of the intensive work of several ministries and departments of the Republic of Belarus. It contains a review of efforts being made by Belarus in order to fulfil at the national level the requirements of the Security Council resolution, as well as information on the status of national legislation to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">The report clearly shows that the President and the Government of the Republic are making serious and comprehensive efforts to fully implement the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In this respect, it is noteworthy that last October, at a meeting of the Republic's Security Council, chaired by our head of State, a decree and a plan of action containing additional measures to combat terrorism were adopted, taking into account the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Furthermore, in order to enhance the Republic's national legislation in the area of counter-terrorism, the Parliament, on 11 December last, passed a law in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">We believe that the rule on the submission of national reports to the Committee is important in two respects. First, it makes it possible to create a system for the effective monitoring of the implementation by Member States of the provisions of the resolution. Secondly, an analysis of the reports will allow for the creation of a universal model for a legal regime to combat terrorism in all States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">In this connection, a serious and comprehensive review of national reports by independent and highly qualified experts is extremely important. The Republic of Belarus believes that the value and authority of the Committee's conclusions on the reports will be greatly enhanced if those experts who have a key role in the review are appointed in a manner that ensures equitable geographical representation and the representation of the world's main legal systems. We hope that these principles will be given greater attention in the subsequent appointment of experts.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">We would also like to support the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee aimed at assisting Member States, through the provision of technical and other assistance, in the creation of effective national infrastructures to combat terrorism. In this connection, Belarus welcomes the recommendations made to the Committee in the declaration on global efforts to combat terrorism, adopted in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1377(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1377 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Our State, which is located at the crossroads of the main international and European transport routes and on the dividing line between the eastern and western parts of the Euro-Asian continent, deems of particular importance the need to ensure strict border control, in order to prevent the illegal transit of weapons and ammunition, illegal migration, drug trafficking and other activities that have links to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The Republic's border and customs entities are making every effort, to the extent of their ability, to put in place a viable system of border and customs control. However, our economic problems -- characteristic of a country with an economy in transition -- are preventing us from providing the necessary technical equipment to State border crossing points and to the relevant border and customs services. This is hindering the adoption of more concrete measures to combat terrorism. Our Government will submit to the Committee in the near future specific proposals on the provision of assistance. We hope that effective mechanisms will be found to help Belarus resolve these problems.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">As a whole, the Government of Belarus greatly appreciates the work done by the Counter-Terrorism Committee in its first three months. A solid foundation has been laid for the successful discharge of its mandate. In our view, this United Nations body has, in a short period of time, assumed the necessary international authority and established itself firmly as an element of the anti-terrorist system of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">In future, we see the Committee as being a rapid-response body of the United Nations in the area of terrorist activities. In this connection, a priority area for the further work of the Committee could be to assist States in establishing, under the auspices of the United Nations, a truly effective cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism in the framework of anti-terrorist conventions. This would make it possible to further strengthen the Committee's interaction with the various structures and divisions of the United Nations Secretariat, as well as with regional and national organs combating terrorism, through the provision of the necessary information and of databases.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fall</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Like Ambassador Kishore Mahbubani, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, for having chosen the format of this meeting, which has enabled States that are not members of the Council to participate actively in this interactive dialogue with the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Allow me also to thank those delegations that have reiterated their congratulations to us and expressed their support as Guinea takes its seat in the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Let us recall that, immediately following the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the international community made clear its resolve to wage a battle against terrorism. The spontaneous reaction of the General Assembly and the Security Council clearly indicates that the time has finally come to tackle with growing determination the scourge of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Guinea believes that terrorism poses a threat to international peace and security and it fully associates itself with the efforts under way to combat and eradicate it. Guinea welcomes the victorious struggle waged by the United States against the Al-Qaeda network and its sponsors, the Taliban. It believes that effective and vigorous measures must be taken by all States effectively to combat international terrorism. That is why my country unreservedly supports the provisions contained in the resolutions of the Security Council adopted since the deadly attacks of 11 September, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and calls on all States fully to implement them.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">My delegation wishes to congratulate the Counter-Terrorism Committee which, since its inception, has done outstanding work. The elaboration of rules relating to the work of the Committee, the provision to Member States of the necessary guidelines needed for the preparation of national reports, the publication of a list of contacts, the drawing up, in cooperation with the Secretary-General, of a roster of experts in areas relevant to the work of the Committee, and the submission to date of numerous reports by Member States, demonstrate once again the will of the Committee and of Member States fully to cooperate on this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, and to the other members of the Committee, for the high calibre of the programme of work presented.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">The dedication and personal commitment of Sir Jeremy, as well as the transparency with which he reports to representatives of Member States and other institutions on the activities of the Committee, are ample testimony of his resolve to cooperate with all parties in discharging the mandate entrusted to the Committee. We encourage the Committee to continue its work and assure it of the full support of the Guinean delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">We must now forge ahead and increasingly focus on the assessments resulting from the review of the various reports of Member States and, when possible, make the most of comparative advantages on all sides, in order to harmonize activities in the common fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">My delegation, while welcoming the appointment of experts, wishes to encourage the representation of all regions within the group of experts, as this would foster an understanding of the problems experienced by States of different regions.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">We welcome also the cooperation of various entities with the Committee. My delegation would also suggest that the Committee strengthen its cooperation with regional organizations, as the rigorous implementation of regional instruments against terrorism could benefit the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">I would like to associate myself with the message of thanks to Sir Jeremy Greenstock for the very encouraging information he gave us this morning on this subject in response to a question by Ambassador Ryan.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">In the context of assistance to be provided to States, my delegation welcomes the forthcoming establishment of a source list of consultative and specialized services in the field of legislative and administrative practices, as envisaged in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Special attention is to be given to the States that have the greatest need for assistance in the development of their initial reports. In this regard, we encourage the prompt establishment of a special trust fund.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa13">My delegation appreciates the procedure laid out by the Committee with regard to reviewing the initial reports submitted by Member States. We believe that the procedure thus proposed, and the experience drawn from it in reviewing initial reports, will contribute to improving the future work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa14">The results achieved by the international community to date testify to the resolve of all to combat and eliminate terrorism. To achieve that objective, the cooperation of all States is necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa15">In conclusion, allow me to thank Ambassador Navarrete for the quality of his contribution to the work of the Council. His soothing voice, full of wisdom, will be missed by the Council, and we wish him every success in the pursuit of his career.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The tragic events of 11 September have greatly changed the picture of the world. Today, as never before, the members of the world community are united in recognizing the need for an uncompromising battle against international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">We note with satisfaction that the Security Council has assumed a leadership role in creating a global system to counter terrorism. Its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is undoubtedly a major historic document. This resolution is far from being a declaratory appeal. It imposes the obligation on each State to lead a decisive struggle against international terrorism on the basis of universal conventions, for as long as required and harshly if necessary, thus observing the norms of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The Counter-Terrorism Committee established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> must be an effective mechanism of international monitoring of compliance by all Member States with the decisions of the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole regarding the struggle against terrorism. We commend its energetic activities and, to a great extent, credit for them is due to the Chairman of the Committee, Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">We share the view that the Counter-Terrorism Committee should in no way function as a repressive body. It was never contemplated in this way. The main task of the Committee lies in compiling and analysing, with the assistance of appropriate experts, information provided by States on the counter-terrorism measures they have undertaken and to submit appropriate recommendations. An important function of the Committee will also be to give the necessary advisory and technical assistance to States with a view to their effective implementation of obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Russia will make every effort possible to assist in carrying out these tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">We note with satisfaction that, as required under the resolution, 123 Member States have submitted their national reports on the steps they have taken in the area of counter-terrorism. However, we must express concern over the fact that nearly a third of Member States have not yet done so. We hope that the reports of these States will reach the Committee in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">As for Russia, we are taking all necessary measures in response to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. President Putin signed a decree devoted specifically to its implementation, in which the State structure of the Russian Federation is instructed to carry out a set of effective steps to freeze the accounts of persons or organizations suspected of terrorist activities, to strengthen border control measures, to halt entry by terrorists, to introduce necessary changes to existing legislation and to develop international cooperation and exchange of information concerning counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">Russia is a party to 10 of the 12 universal conventions against terrorism. The remaining two are in the final stages of the ratification process. We intend to continue, not in our words, but in our actions, to make our contribution to joint efforts to neutralize the threat of terrorism, and to do so within the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa01">I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa02">I will now give the floor to four speakers from the list of non-Council members. The next speaker inscribed on this list is the representative of Poland. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Staczyk</span> <span class="nation">Poland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa01">First of all, let me congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council in January. I also wish to extend my congratulations to the new members of the Council: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and the Syrian Arab Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa02">Let me also thank you, Mr. President, for convening this debate on an issue of utmost importance to all Member States of the United Nations. Almost four months have elapsed since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and it is indeed time to take stock of actions taken in the struggle against terrorism on the basis of Council decisions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa03">Poland has already associated itself with the statement made on behalf of the European Union by the representative of Spain. However, we would like to add some remarks from a regional perspective, as Poland hosted, on 6 November last year, the Warsaw Conference on Combating Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa04">The Conference, convened at the initiative of the President of the Republic of Poland, Mr. Aleksander Kwaniewski, brought together heads of State from Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, in order to enhance regional cooperation in the area of combating terrorism and to identify areas of particular significance for the struggle against this scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa05">The following countries participated in the Conference: the Republic of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Republic of Croatia, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Slovenia, Ukraine, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Poland. Representatives of the Republic of Belarus, the Russian Federation, Turkey, the United States of America, the European Union, the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization participated as observers.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa06">The Conference resulted in the adoption of a Declaration and an Action Plan, which determined the steps to be undertaken by the participants and which were published as a Security Council document under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-2001-1142.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/1142</a>. The heads of State were unanimous in their condemnation of the terrorist attacks of 11 September, considering them an assault on the basic freedoms and security of all the people of the world and stressing that the fight against international terrorism is not a confrontation between different religions or cultures. Moreover, the participants pledged their full support for anti-terrorist action being taken within the framework of the United Nations, calling upon all States to implement fully the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and to ratify the existing international conventions relating to terrorism. They also stressed their conviction that it is through common and coordinated action that terrorist organizations and those who support, finance, train and harbour them will be brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa07">Particular stress was put on the need to increase the capacity of the participating States to effectively respond to the challenges posed by terrorism. The strengthening of internal legislation and institutions responsible for combating terrorism was identified as one of the main priorities in this field. It is the primary responsibility of each country to prevent and suppress international terrorism within its jurisdiction, and international efforts can only be successful when every State has effective operational mechanisms to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa08">Increasing cooperation in areas of information exchange and intelligence sharing is another sphere where mutual efforts should bring fruitful results. The participants of the Warsaw Conference have thus pledged to strengthen their collaboration in this respect by sharing their experience and knowledge with respect to those suspected of involvement in international terrorism. Sharing of knowledge in the area of anti-terrorist training has also been envisaged as part of the process, with the possibility of establishing a training centre for this purpose. Cooperation between border and immigration services, as well as the police, is yet another sphere in which the participants in the Conference decided to increase their cooperation, as the ability to identify terrorist threats at early stages, before they can develop into networks and larger operations, is considered critical for the successful implementation of the common plan of action against terrorism. The need to strengthen the control of arms exports and the importance of non-proliferation regimes were likewise emphasized.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa09">While highlighting the need to undertake practical steps for the prevention and suppression of terrorism, the participants agreed that a sustainable effort in this respect is required. It should address not only the symptoms of this scourge, but also its causes. One of the objectives that could be pursued is the promotion of tolerance and multiculturalism by upholding our common values and enriching curricula at all levels of education.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa10">To sustain the struggle against terrorism and to achieve our common goal of eliminating this scourge, a stable and strong commitment will be required from all States. It is the intention of the States participating in the Warsaw Conference that it not be a one-time event but rather a process through which they will be better able to deal with the common threat of terrorism. These regional efforts are aimed at complementing and reinforcing the global effort in which the United Nations plays a fundamental role.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa11">I would also like to avail myself of this occasion to express our appreciation to the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, His Excellency Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for the excellent leadership that he has provided in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa12">It has been encouraging to learn that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> has elicited an unparalleled response from Member States. It is a clear sign of the commitment of the United Nations members to the struggle against international terrorism. We believe that this process will make us all better prepared to cope with the challenges ahead, and it will strengthen or put in place the tools necessary for effective action at all levels of international cooperation. It is also a learning process, and we all stand to benefit from the experience gained. Furthermore, in the sphere of combating terrorism, Poland will spare no efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Charter and to contribute to the achievement of the goals set out by this Organization.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Poland for the kind words he has addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Mongolia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Enkhsaikhan</span> <span class="nation">Mongolia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">First of all I would like to express my delegation's gratitude to you, Sir, for organizing this meeting on implementation of the <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">As of today, almost two thirds of the Member States have submitted their reports on the implementation of the resolution to the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Therefore, we believe that consideration of the issue today is both timely and useful for assessing where we are and for contemplating a long-term, effective strategy of combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">In this connection my delegation would like to thank the Secretary-General for his brief, yet very important and pertinent remarks made earlier this morning at the meeting, as well as Ambassador Greenstock, the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, for the briefing on the progress of the Committee's work and for responding to the questions raised in the course of this debate.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">Mongolia believes that pledges of support are not sufficient to fight this evil. Practical actions are needed for a common struggle against terrorism. Mongolia has signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and will be ratifying it very soon. In so doing, it will have ratified all the global conventions combating terrorism that can be practically implemented by a land-locked country. Moreover, earlier this month the Mongolian parliament strengthened the relevant anti-terrorist provisions of its criminal legislation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">Combating terrorism should be universal. To be effective, all States need to be actively involved, including those that are not at present directly affected by terrorism or are not parties to ad hoc coalitions. The States not directly affected or involved must nevertheless deny safe haven to terrorists and deny transit through their territory of terrorists, their resources and sources of financing. It cannot be ruled out that terrorists in the future, following the law of least resistance, could contemplate pursuing their aims through smaller, weaker or so-called neutral States, seeing in them, as Ambassador Greenstock has rightly pointed out, a "weak link" in the chain opposing or fighting terrorism. Moreover, early warning, exchange of operational information, investigation, prosecution and so on can be successful only with the active participation of all States of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">My delegation believes that one of the effective ways to combat terrorism would be to deprive terrorists of ideological justification of their actions, since in many cases terrorists attempt to give religious or national justification or coloration to their criminal acts. In such cases, active denunciation by representatives of hijacked nations or religions of such attempts are of paramount importance in discrediting the terrorists and thus narrowing the social basis of terrorism. Depriving the terrorists of ideological justification could in this case be considered as a form of preventive diplomacy.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">Because of its nature and universal membership, the General Assembly has a special role to play in such preventive action. Thus, the General Assembly, as the main United Nations organ that is empowered to consider the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security, should continue to address the different aspects of terrorism, including the legal, socio-economic and even cultural aspects, all of which remain outside the Security Council's mandate and that of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The fight against terrorism will be successful if it is undertaken in compliance with and through strengthening of international law and order. In that connection, my delegation expresses the hope that the Ad Hoc Committee on terrorism established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/210</a> will soon be able to finalize a draft convention against nuclear terrorism and a comprehensive convention against terrorism, based on the progress made during the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">Likewise, my delegation believes that measures need to be taken to accelerate the entry into force of the Statute of the International Criminal Court as a timely response to impunity for crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">Besides those legal measures, effective political measures need also to be taken to address the long-standing festering international problems on which terrorism feeds. Terrorism is being supported through drug trafficking, trafficking in arms and explosives, money-laundering, electronic fraud, etc. Therefore, other relevant United Nations bodies, such as the Vienna United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, as well as the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) and other multilateral organizations, should also be more actively involved in the fight.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">We agree fully that regional action to combat terrorism is very important, and in some cases even crucial. The existence of seven regional agreements and the emergence of an eighth as part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization constitute a vital link between individual national measures and concerted or coordinated international measures. In many cases it is the regional agreements that will make a difference in effectively combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">Last but not least, my delegation shares the view that the strategy for combating terrorism will not be effective if the root causes of terrorism are not properly addressed. Poverty, deprivation, frustration and despair, which bring suffering to millions of people, provide a fertile breeding ground for terrorism. Many of the root causes of terrorism are to be found in or are connected with abject poverty. Therefore, in our view, the General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies should redouble their efforts to reduce and eliminate poverty in line with the objectives of the Millennium Declaration. My delegation believes that perhaps the question of combating international terrorism could be taken up by the General Assembly at a special session after the Counter-Terrorism Committee has presented its report, conclusions and recommendations to the Council and after the Council has in turn reported to the Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Miss Durrant</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the 14 members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) that are Members of the United Nations: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and my own country, Jamaica.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">CARICOM congratulates you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January, and we thank you for organizing this open debate and for the interactive manner in which it has been conducted. We also extend congratulations to the new members of the Council: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and the Syrian Arab Republic. And on behalf of the Jamaican delegation I wish to express appreciation for the excellent cooperation we received from all other members of the Council during our membership.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">I wish also to pay particular tribute to our friend and colleague Ambassador Jorge Navarrete for the contribution he has already made to the work of the Security Council on behalf of his country, Mexico. We are sorry to see him go, and we wish him every success in his future endeavours.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">Let me thank Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock for his comprehensive report on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and commend him for his extremely effective leadership. Jamaica, having participated in the work of the Committee until the end of December 2001, fully appreciates the transparency with which the work of the Committee has been carried out. We consider continued transparency to be important to the credibility of the Committee's future work if it is to achieve the level of cooperation expected from Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">CARICOM members have joined in the global condemnation of terrorism in all its forms, and have pledged full support for the collective measures being undertaken by the United Nations, which include taking all necessary steps within our capacities to implement the measures set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September 2001. The Security Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> created new legal obligations for States in combating terrorism. The range of measures set out in the resolution are quite comprehensive in nature, to wit: precluding anyone within our territories or jurisdiction from in any way aiding and abetting the planning, promoting, financing or executing of acts of terrorism or otherwise supporting such acts; preventing and suppressing the financing of terrorist acts; and refraining from providing any form of support, and denying safe haven, to perpetrators of terrorism. We fully subscribe to the decisive action taken by the Security Council in prescribing those measures, and we support them as necessary and prudent if the international community is to succeed in combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">While we have no reservations about what we need to do, we must also recognize the added burden placed on States in implementing these provisions. Not all States have an equal capacity to fully implement the measures provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Many countries face the prospect of not being able to fully commit scarce resources, human and financial, to that endeavour. It is therefore incumbent on the international community, led by those with the capacity to do so, to provide the necessary financial and technical assistance to those who need it. By fully accepting that principle, the objective we seek to attain will be realized: combating by all means threats to international peace and security posed by terrorist acts. It is very encouraging that the Counter-Terrorism Committee has taken up this issue and is putting in place a mechanism for providing technical assistance to Member States. We therefore support the Committee Chairman's proposal for the establishment of a trust fund to support that initiative. We also support the role proposed by the Secretary-General for the Bretton Woods institutions in the global effort to combat terrorism, and we welcome the offer made by Member States to provide technical assistance. We share the view that the fight against terrorism can succeed only if all Member States have the capacity to play the role envisaged for them in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">CARICOM wishes to draw attention to the problems posed by the illegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons and the linkages to the illicit drug trade that have become a major source of terrorism affecting the stability and economic development of some Member States. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, in its paragraph 4, recognized that relationship and emphasized the need to enhance coordination of efforts in order to strengthen a global response to this serious challenge and threat to international security. It is important for us to enhance coordination of efforts on the national, subregional and international levels to strengthen the global response to the serious challenges posed by links between international terrorism and transnational organized crime, illicit drugs, money-laundering and illegal arms trafficking, in particular the illegal trafficking in small arms and light weapons. We urge the Counter-Terrorism Committee to engage fully in assisting Member States in dealing with these problems through facilitating the exchange of information, technical assistance and other forms of support.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">We agree that there must be a renewed commitment to international efforts aimed at addressing global issues which give rise to terrorism. We believe very strongly that the international community must be prepared to address the problems of poverty, the prevalence of regional conflicts, the denial of human rights, the denial of access to justice for all and equal protection under law, and the lack of sustainable development. While stating unequivocally that no cause or grievance can justify reprehensible attacks against innocent victims, we must recognize that these are conditions which provide fertile breeding grounds for terrorism and a cover for those who perpetrate terrorist acts. These issues must be featured prominently on the agenda of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">Acts of terrorism threaten the stability and the social and economic development of all States and undermine global stability and prosperity. We in the Caribbean reiterate our commitment to work with the international community in the fight against terrorism in accordance with international law and conventions. We look forward to continuing to work cooperatively with the Committee in carrying out its responsibilities in combating international terrorism.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">I have the honour of speaking on behalf of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), namely, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, on a matter which we all consider very important. We would like to thank the Security Council for this timely opportunity to have a meaningful exchange of views on the implementation of Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. This resolution covers a wide range of issues including, among others, measures to inhibit terrorist activities, the call for cooperation through bilateral and multilateral arrangements in various areas and the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. It is our hope that this open meeting, which complements the regular briefings by the chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, will help us better understand the wide impact and repercussions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">We in ASEAN believe that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations presents a direct challenge to international peace and security, development and prosperity. We have been steadily strengthening our cooperation in countering terrorism and other related transnational crimes during the past few years. We have noted the close link between international terrorism and other transnational crimes, and we have recognized the growing need for us to deal with its many forms. We held our first ASEAN ministerial Conference on Transnational Crime in Manila in December 1997, where our Ministers resolved to strengthen their commitment to cooperating at the regional level in combating transnational crimes such as terrorism, illicit drug trafficking, arms smuggling, money-laundering, trafficking in persons and piracy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">Our Ministers have also met on two other occasions, the most recent being the third ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime in Singapore last year. Our cooperation has also crossed over to the ASEAN Regional Forum, where our experts had useful exchanges at the Experts Group Meetings on Transnational Crime in Seoul, Republic of Korea, in the year 2000 and last year in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">Acts of terrorism require concerted and sustained responses and actions at the international, regional and national levels. With this in mind, our leaders adopted the ASEAN Declaration on Joint Action to Counter Terrorism on 5 November last year as our regional response.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">In the Declaration, our leaders expressed their commitment</p>
	<blockquote id="pg012-bk02-pa07">"to counter, prevent and suppress all forms of terrorist acts in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other international law, especially taking into account the importance of all relevant United Nations resolutions".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">They underlined the importance of strengthening regional and international cooperation in meeting these challenges. ASEAN leaders rejected any attempt to link terrorism with any religion or race. They also renewed their commitment to pursuing effective policies and strategies aimed at enhancing the well-being of the people, which will be each member's national contribution in the fight against terrorism. All cooperative efforts to combat terrorism at the regional level will consider joint practical counter-terrorism measures in line with the specific circumstances in the region and in each member country. Towards this end, ASEAN Foreign Ministers will consider during their retreat in Phuket, Thailand, to be held next month, an agreement on exchange of information and the establishment of communication procedures in this context.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">As a follow-up to the Declaration, ASEAN will soon be convening an Ad Hoc Experts Group Meeting and special sessions of the Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime. A special ASEAN ministerial meeting on issues of terrorism is scheduled to be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in April this year. The meeting represents a significant step by ASEAN in response to the United Nations call to enhance coordination of national, subregional and international efforts aimed at strengthening the global response to terrorism. In addition, the relevant ASEAN Ministers have been tasked with undertaking nine additional practical measures in line with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Individually, each ASEAN member country has also undertaken steps aimed at combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Countering terrorism presents an enormously challenging task to us all, and it certainly requires strong cooperation at all levels. ASEAN has acted in a timely and responsible manner to address this challenge. ASEAN remains steadfast in its commitment and support of all efforts to promote international cooperation in combating terrorism in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Finally, on behalf of my ASEAN colleagues, I take this opportunity to commend Ambassador Navarrete and wish him success in his future endeavours.</p>

At the last meeting of the OSCE Ministerial Council, held in Bucharest on 3 and 4 December, the member States of our organization resolutely reiterated their condemnation of all "terrorist acts in all forms and manifestations, committed no matter when, where or by whom" and considered that these acts are a "threat to international and regional peace, security and stability".</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">OSCE considers that there must be no safe haven for those perpetrating, financing, harbouring or otherwise supporting those responsible for such criminal acts. Terrorism, whatever its motivation or origin, has no justification.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">OSCE is determined to contribute to the fulfilment of international obligations as enshrined, inter alia, in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of this Council and will act in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. All OSCE participating States have pledged to become parties to all 12 United Nations conventions and protocols related to terrorism as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">The OSCE member States have also, in the spirit prevailing in the Counter-Terrorism Committee, offered to provide support, including technical assistance, to Central Asian partners at their request, in countering external threats related to terrorism. I believe it is appropriate for me to reiterate this offer here today.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">The adoption by OSCE of a detailed plan of action for combating terrorism must be seen as an effort to complement other actions being taken by other international institutions. In fact, we intend to focus on areas where we can offer some added value in preventive, as well as crisis-management, tasks, such as police-training, border controls and the adoption of appropriate legislation, as well as judicial reform.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">The plan of action covers a wide range of issues with the aim of establishing a framework for comprehensive OSCE action to be taken by participating States, and the Organization as a whole, in combating terrorism, while maintaining full respect for international law, including the international law of human rights. The plan of action seeks to expand existing activities that contribute to combating terrorism, facilitate interaction between States and, where appropriate, identify new instruments for action.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">I should also note that it is the intention of the Chairman-in-Office of OSCE to nominate a personal representative to coordinate with other international organizations the political aspects of the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">It is also the intention of the Chairman-in-Office to work towards the adoption of an OSCE charter against terrorism, a goal that we hope can be attained soon.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa10">Finally, Portugal intends to organize in Lisbon in June 2002 a meeting of the secretaries-general of all the principal international organizations to consider the joint efforts to combat terrorism. We believe that such an initiative may contribute to better coordination of international efforts and may guarantee global coherence in the work of those organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa11">We are convinced that the steps being taken by OSCE in its counter-terrorism efforts will assist the whole international community in ensuring that the threat posed by terrorists to international peace and security will be thwarted.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa12">We are certain that the excellent cooperation that has characterized the relationship between our two organizations -- our activities have grown progressively closer and become more complementary, as attested in the resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 21 December 2001 -- will become even more interlinked in the fight against terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vohidov</span> <span class="nation">Uzbekistan</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset to thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his extremely detailed and useful briefing on the work carried out by the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter terrorism. The creation within the structure of the Security Council of the Counter-Terrorism Committee has again demonstrated that the United Nations is a key international structure in the fight against terrorism and other threats in the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">In accordance with paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, Uzbekistan has submitted its report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee on the steps it has taken to implement this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">We would like to note that the contact centres in Uzbekistan, established in accordance with the programme of work of the Committee for its first 30-day period, are ready for active dialogue with the corresponding contact centres of other States and with competent international organizations on questions covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">Uzbekistan feels that in the first 90-day period of the implementation of its mandate, the Counter-Terrorism Committee has achieved positive results in implementing the provisions of paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The effectiveness of its work is to be seen in the fact that by mid-January of this year, 123 States have already submitted their reports on their progress in the implementation of measures provided for under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We learned with enthusiasm of the results of the first work period of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, and we support its recently published programme of work covering its second 90-day period.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">There is no doubt that the activities of the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee deserve the highest praise. Sir Jeremy Greenstock has set an example of openness and informativeness in his work and is actively carrying out meetings in various formats for an exchange of views and ideas of Members of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">I should like to note that Uzbekistan, as a party to all 12 international conventions and protocols against terrorism, has been in favour for several years of the creation within the United Nations of a centre to counter all manifestations of international terrorism. The circumstance that the functions entrusted to the Counter-Terrorism Committee are consonant with those that were proposed for the mandate initiated by us in 1999 for the International Centre to Combat Terrorism is a source of satisfaction for Uzbekistan and stirs the desire to continue our cooperation fruitfully.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">In the Millennium Declaration adopted during the Millennium Summit, heads of State and Government expressed their determination to undertake agreed actions to combat international terrorism. In the light of the tragic events of 11 September 2001 and the still existing threat and challenges of international terrorism, work to develop two new international instruments to be adopted by the General Assembly is more timely than ever. These include a comprehensive convention to combat international terrorism and a convention to combat acts of nuclear terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">However, today's reality shows that it is not enough to simply adopt legal instrument in the fight against terrorism. We must recognize that the threat of obtaining, possession and use by terrorists of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons is real. We feel that, in order to achieve effective results to combat terrorism, we need to create a global system of cooperation within the United Nations. In this context, particularly significant is the fact that the question of combating international terrorism falls directly within the competence of the Security Council, which was in particular reflected in the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. However, we are sure that together with this, we will need to increase the overall United Nations potential to combat international terrorism by further strengthening and developing the already existing structures and divisions of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">We are convinced that only through joint efforts can we counter international terrorism, which requires that we develop agreed global measures and possibly a global plan of action to combat terrorism. In this context, we support the Secretary-General's initiative on the speedy convening of a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations to develop a plan for jointly organized actions of the international community to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">We are sure that such a conference would promote constructive consideration and adoption of urgent strategies and measures to eliminate international terrorism.</p>

	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Uzbekistan for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Clodumar</span> <span class="nation">Nauru</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, allow me first to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of January and for your initiative in convening this important meeting, especially by allowing non-Council members to participate. I also wish to congratulate the new Council members who assumed their seats in the Council at the beginning of this month.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">It is my honour and privilege to address the Security Council, for the first time since Nauru became a United Nations Member in 1999, on behalf of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum Group of countries that maintain permanent missions in New York -- namely, Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, the Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country, Nauru.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">The Pacific Islands Forum member States and the Forum secretariat are individually and collectively resolved to do all we can to combat the scourge of terrorism. We have welcomed and we fully support <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is a trailblazing step that reflects the universal revulsion at the attacks of 11 September. We commend the speed and vigour with which the Counter-Terrorism Committee, under the chairmanship of Ambassador Greenstock, has gone about its work. In particular, we appreciate the understanding that the Committee has shown regarding technical and other assistance, which some countries will need to fulfil their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We welcome the Counter-Terrorism Committee's forward-looking programme of work and priorities, which reflects awareness that the fight against terrorism will be long and that it will require the persistence and cooperation of all Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">The steps that individual Pacific Islands Forum countries are taking to meet their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> are set out in their reports to the Committee on Counter-Terrorism. In addition, however, the secretariat of the Forum has submitted a report to the Committee, highlighting regional aspects of our response to terrorism. Among other steps, we are seeking to strengthen the way in which we deal with money-laundering and seek to suppress the financing of terrorism. We are working to meet the challenge of illegal migrant smuggling. Our law enforcement, customs and immigration agencies are looking at ways to strengthen cooperation and intelligence-sharing. Pacific Islands Forum members are examining model legislation on extradition, mutual assistance in criminal matters, the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime, the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and other measures to counter money-laundering. We are working more closely than ever with international organizations to fight terrorism and transnational crime.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">No region is immune from the threat of terrorism, and no region can neglect its responsibility to contribute to the global fight against terrorism. Our efforts in the Pacific, at the national, regional and international levels, are part of the overall response to our common threat. We in the Pacific are committed to shouldering our responsibilities. As the Security Council takes our joint endeavour forward, in particular through the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, it can be assured of our fullest support.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk03">

	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa01">I thank the representative of Nauru for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bhattarai</span> <span class="nation">Nepal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I wish to begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, and your proud country, Mauritius, on assuming the presidency of the Council for this very first month of the year 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">I would also like to congratulate and wish all success to Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and Syria as new members of the Council and to express sincere appreciation to the Council's outgoing members, Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and Ukraine, for their contributions during their term in the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Mr. President, let me also thank you for your initiative to hold during your presidency this important public meeting on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. I wonder what other topic could be more timely than this subject of paramount relevance and significance for us all, especially in the aftermath of the horrendous terrorist attacks of 11 September.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">It has been the principled position of Nepal to condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We believe there is no justification whatsoever to condone any terrorist activity. With this firm conviction in heart and mind, Nepal has categorically supported the actions taken by the Security Council to deal with terrorism, particularly its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In this spirit, my delegation fully endorses the work the Counter-Terrorism Committee has accomplished to date. Our sincere thanks are due to Sir Jeremy Greenstock and other members of the Committee's bureau, as well as to the members of the technical team, for the professionalism and efficiency with which the Committee is moving forward in an exemplary fashion. We particularly appreciate the efforts the Committee has made so far in ensuring that transparency is maintained at the highest level, and we sincerely hope it will continue as a distinct feature throughout the Committee's work in future. I believe the regular briefings play a crucial role also in building a sense of ownership of the membership in the work of the Committee, which is so crucial if we are striving to achieve global success in tackling this menace of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">I would like to emphasize that our support to the work of the Security Council and the Counter-Terrorism Committee is consistent with the firm commitment of Nepal to fighting terrorism in all its forms and at all levels and constitutes an important step in our pursuit to realize that commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">At the national level, my country has become prey to serious terrorist activities of the so-called Maoist outfits for over five years now, which have caused an irreparable loss of over 2,000 lives and property and delayed the process of the country's overall development. Left with no alternative, particularly in the face of the Maoists' breach of good faith in negotiations, a state of emergency has been declared in accordance with the provisions of the Nepalese Constitution. His Majesty's Government has been fighting this domestic terrorism with the promulgation of a Terrorism and Disruptive Activities Control and Punishment Ordinance.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">Thanks to our strong determination to support the implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> to the maximum extent possible, despite our multiple difficulties, including those relating to financial and technical aspects of compiling the actions taken by various agencies of His Majesty's Government, Nepal has submitted its report on time pursuant to operative paragraph 6 of the resolution. I will not recount the contents of the report here but would like to state that, while the report may not be comprehensive in terms of encapsulating all measures that Nepal has taken to date to fight and contain terrorism both at home and abroad, we believe it does provide a sense of the magnitude of terrorism the country is facing and an adequate outline of the steps we have taken. With the assistance of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, we believe a more comprehensive picture may well be developed in due course. The forms of such assistance could be wide-ranging and need to be identified and attended to with utmost care and seriousness.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">At the global level, Nepal is already a party to six of the 12 international anti-terrorism conventions and signatory to a seventh -- the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. Measures are being taken to strengthen existing legal provisions and also to prepare for our accession to the remaining anti-terrorism conventions.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">Let me take a few moments to highlight the initiatives taken at the level of the region to which Nepal belongs. It is important to note that, despite the great sensitivities and the fragile atmosphere in South Asia, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has provided a valuable forum for all its seven members -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- to fight terrorism together. We in Nepal believe that this regional forum has significant potential that will enable us to see the light at the end of the tunnel of uncertainty in the region. Nepal is proud to have been engaged in the South Asian regional process of dealing with terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">South Asia, struck by the hard blows of terrorism, has become fully aware of the magnitude of, and potential threat posed by, this scourge. Prompted by a strong awareness of the need to take action to deal with terrorism at the regional level, we adopted the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism in 1987 in Kathmandu. It is important to note that, of the seven regional instruments concluded to date around the world, the SAARC Convention was one of the first three concluded in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa11">Nepal has always been an active member of the Association in the context of its endeavours to free the region from the scourge of terrorism, and I am happy to state that, while the third SAARC Summit in Kathmandu in 1987 adopted the SAARC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism, the eleventh SAARC Summit, held in Kathmandu from 4 to 6 January 2002, has given a forceful impetus to efforts to develop and promulgate enabling legislation in all member States.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa12">I wish to refer to certain relevant portions of the Declaration adopted by the heads of State or Government of the seven member States at the eleventh SAARC Summit, as this is directly relevant to the subject of today's open meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa13">In the Declaration, convinced that terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, is a challenge to all States and to all of humanity and cannot be justified on ideological, political, religious or on any other grounds, the heads of State or Government agreed that terrorism violates the fundamental values of the United Nations Charter and of the SAARC Charter and constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security in the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa14">Regarding ways of dealing with the problem of terrorism, the heads of State or Government emphasized the need for the urgent conclusion of a comprehensive convention on combating international terrorism. They also emphasized that international cooperation to combat terrorism should be conducted in conformity with the United Nations Charter, international law and relevant international conventions.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa15">The heads of State or Government also made specific reference to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The leaders reiterated their support for the resolution and affirmed their determination to redouble their efforts collectively, as well as individually, to prevent and suppress terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including through increased cooperation and full implementation of the relevant international conventions relating to terrorism to which they are party.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa16">In this context, they called on all States to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts by criminalizing the collection of funds for such acts and refraining from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in States or acquiescing to organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts. The leaders reaffirmed that the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations has to be comprehensive and sustained.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa17">All seven leaders of South Asia were unanimous in recognizing the distant but ominous link between terrorism, drug trafficking, money-laundering and other transnational crimes, and emphasized the need to coordinate efforts at the national and regional levels to strengthen the global response to this serious challenge and the threat to international security. They called upon the international community to assist member States of SAARC to deal effectively with the adverse economic effects of terrorism in general and to meet rising insurance and security-related costs in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa18">In the same vein, the heads of State or Government reaffirmed their commitment to the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism, which, among other things, recognizes the seriousness of the problem of terrorism as it affects the security, stability and development of the region. They also reiterated their firm resolve to accelerate the enactment of enabling legislation within a definite time frame for the full implementation of the Convention, together with strengthening of the SAARC Terrorist Offence Monitoring Desk and the SAARC Drug Offences Monitoring Desk, in an effective manner.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa19">Nepal believes that the war on terror should be a dual one, aiming to achieve both peace and development, for it to succeed. Deprivation, discrimination and disputes create an environment which generates and fuels the majority of social difficulties as well as evils such as terrorism. The problem of borderlessness requires that an international alliance devise and implement commensurate remedies. It is only with sustained commitment and forthcoming international cooperation that we can win this war. We must win the war on dehumanizing poverty, the war on ignorance and the war on exclusion. This is a basic prerequisite for durable peace and development.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa20">To conclude, over and above Nepal's efforts at the national level to effectively deal with the problem, Nepal is working within the framework of SAARC to eradicate the scourge of terrorism from the face of South Asia. We firmly believe that success will not be far off if, as the SAARC heads of State or Government have envisaged, a comprehensive convention on international terrorism is concluded without delay. Nepal is committed to moving ahead collectively in pursuit of our common goal of making our homes, societies and planet free, prosperous, secure and peaceful.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Nasser</span> <span class="nation">Qatar</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">Allow me, at the outset, on behalf of the delegation of the State of Qatar, which holds the presidency of the ninth Summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January. I am confident that your extensive experience, knowledge and wisdom will lead the work of the Security Council to a successful conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">I should also like to express our deep appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Moctar Ouane, Permanent Representative of the friendly Republic of Mali, for the excellent manner in which he guided the work of the Security Council last December.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">I should like also sincerely to congratulate the new members of the Security Council on their election and to wish them every success. Nor can I fail to thank the outgoing members of the Council for the outstanding work they have done.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">Let me also express my heartfelt thanks to Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his efforts as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">There is no doubt that terrorist acts pose a grave challenge to us all. They make it incumbent on us to act to eradicate that scourge. Like other States, we are fully convinced of the need to mobilize international efforts to combat terrorism under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">We truly and firmly believe that we cannot win the war against terrorism through the actions of one State alone or those of a number of States, or even those of the Security Council. This can be accomplished only through our common determination to work together at the international level. The United Nations in this regard is, we believe, the only forum which can face up strongly and effectively to this challenge facing all States -- strong and weak, without exception -- and all humanity. We therefore believe that we ought to stand shoulder to shoulder in taking strong, decisive measures with broad foundations to eradicate this scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">We reaffirm the commitment of the Governments of the Islamic States to join in the efforts of all Governments, bilaterally and internationally, to struggle to eliminate terrorism. Such determination has been expressed at the highest levels, particularly at the emergency meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the member States of the OIC in Doha on 10 October 2001. In that meeting it was reaffirmed that all practical measures would be taken in cooperation with the international community in accordance with the commitments springing from all resolutions and international agreements to which the Islamic States are party.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">All States must refrain from providing any form of assistance or safe haven to the perpetrators of acts of terrorism, acts which run counter to the Charter of the United Nations. They must commit to international efforts to deal with those international issues that foment and create terrorism -- problems such as poverty, hunger, disease, despair and lack of future prospects, as well as regional conflicts, the denial of fundamental human rights, lack of opportunities for equal justice and protection under international law, and the lack of sustainable development and environmental protection. All these provide fertile grounds for terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">The definition of terrorism and the drafting of an international convention to combat it are not academic or theoretical issues; they are factual, practical issues. A strict, comprehensive definition of terrorism could help us in waging the war against it. Proceeding from such a convention, we could set out clearly those States and groups against whom the war is targeted, those who are qualified to lead the struggle against terrorism and terrorists, and the ways and means to be used in such a war.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">The lack of an international understanding on the definition of terrorism and terrorists only encourages more political organizations with extremist ideologies to use terrorism towards their objectives. Some terrorist organizations and some Governments have found that the international community is unable to define terrorism. That has encouraged them to ignore all the values of modern civilization and has led them to cooperate with suspect international crime organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">We believe that any delay in creating an international understanding on terrorism will open the way for some to use the issue in a selective and contradictory manner, which in the end will only weaken the international campaign against terrorism. The international community must not err in describing terrorism and linking it with the legitimacy of the struggle against the occupation of the land of others and the legitimacy of resisting such occupation. Islam stands against aggression and terrorism, as well as against injustice against others and hurting or endangering innocent people.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">The above-mentioned emergency meeting of the Islamic Conference stressed the right of the Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian Arab peoples to combat occupation as a legitimate right enshrined in international laws and norms. The Conference condemned the terrorism by some States and refuted the link between terrorism and the right of peoples to resistance.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">We in the OIC stress our commitment to work with the international community to combat terrorism according to international laws and conventions, as well as to human rights. We stress once again our strong rejection of all forms of international terrorism that threaten innocent lives and the dignity and security of people in all places. We condemn all terrorism that threatens the economic and social development of all States.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa14">International terrorism is a very complicated, multifaceted issue, and it must be defeated through a comprehensive, integrated approach. Member States of the OIC have reaffirmed this effort through their participation in the current international campaign to combat terrorism.</p>

	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">The issue before the Council today is one of particular relevance to the people and the Government of the State of Israel. The State of Israel has been threatened by terrorism since its independence in 1948, and acts of terrorism continue to threaten the lives and welfare of Israeli citizens.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">Just yesterday, a Palestinian terrorist perpetrated another atrocity in the Israeli city of Hadera. At approximately 11 p.m., a terrorist from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade -- a group linked to Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement -- entered a wedding hall packed with hundreds of people and opened fire with an automatic rifle and hand grenades, killing 6 Israelis and wounding more than 30 others. After firing several rounds, the gunman's weapon misfired. Had this fortuitous mishap not occurred, the terrorist rampage would surely have claimed the lives of dozens of others.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">Because of such attacks, Israel has developed an extensive network of government authorities, a body of domestic legislation, a range of practical policies and an intense commitment to combat terrorism in all its aspects. The formation in 1996 of the Bureau for Counter-Terrorism within the Office of the Prime Minister, the establishment in December 2001 of the Department for Counter-Terrorism in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Israel's continued efforts to engage in dialogue and cooperation with other countries, and the ongoing endeavour to improve an extensive body of legislation -- all this emphasizes Israel's enduring commitment to fight terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">Our report submitted pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> outlines the steps that Israel has taken to combat terror and to comply with the demands of the Council. The report describes in detail the extensive legal instruments Israel has created and the policies it has enacted to help protect its citizens from harm and to lend support to the international campaign against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">Cooperation with other countries and with the international community has been a mainstay of Israel's anti-terrorism strategy for decades. Israel has long recognized that the increasingly global nature of the terrorist threat increases the need for cooperation among States, and this has continually been reinforced by Israeli legislation and in agreements reached with other States.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">Consequently, Israel shares its knowledge, expertise and techniques in fighting terrorism with other States and constantly seeks to learn from the counter-terrorist experiences of others. This continued sharing of information and experience is vital and has always been central to Israel's counter-terrorist strategy. Israel also attaches great importance to participation in international instruments designed to combat terrorism. Israel has already signed and ratified a number of international conventions, and many of the remaining conventions are in the process of ratification.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">As numerous world leaders have stated in the aftermath of 11 September, terrorism cannot be fought by targeting only the terrorists themselves. Terrorists depend on the support, assistance and safe harbour granted by States, and it is the States that provide such assistance to terrorist organizations that must be targeted no less than the terrorists themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa09">The Security Council must therefore ensure that all States comply with the Council's resolutions, and that there are consequences to face for failing to do so. In this regard, Israel warmly welcomes the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, which has a crucial role to play in helping States develop counter-terrorist strategies and ensuring compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa10">Foremost among its objectives must be to carefully scrutinize the reports submitted under paragraph 6 of the resolution and to closely monitor the actions taken by States to bring their legislation and policies into accord with the will of the international community. The Committee should not be prevented from drawing attention to States that fail to fulfil their international responsibilities. No State can be allowed to believe that it can continue to support terrorism with impunity.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa11">In addition to the numerous important measures stipulated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and adopted by many responsible Governments, it is important that in our campaign against terrorism we make no distinctions between terrorist organizations on the basis of the causes they espouse and the objectives they purport to pursue. We must defend the principle that no cause justifies the deliberate and indiscriminate targeting of civilians. We must define terrorism on the basis of what one does, not what one does it for.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa12">As the Secretary-General declared in the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September and has emphasized on other occasions,</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa13">"There can be no acceptance of those who would seek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent civilian life, regardless of cause or grievance. If there is one universal principle that all peoples can agree on, surely it is that." (<i><a href="../html/A-56-PV.12.html">A/56/PV.12</a>, para. 26</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa14">Failing to uphold this principle will have disastrous consequences for the international campaign against terrorism, as it will bestow a measure of legitimacy on those who seek to achieve their goals through violence. This will serve to empower extremists at the expense of leaders willing to resolve disputes through peaceful dialogue. If the international community tolerates any act of terrorism as a legitimate tactic, it renders irrelevant the very methods it has championed for the peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa15">Israel has been a willing partner in the counter-terrorism effort and is committed to sharing and working with other States in order to assist the international effort against the scourge of terror. Israel hopes that its experience will be of value to other States and, at the same time, that it will be able to learn from the knowledge and expertise of others in our shared challenge of combating international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa16">We firmly believe that through the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions, by increasing and enhancing international cooperation and by using the tools at our disposal to target State sponsors of terror, we can protect ourselves and succeeding generations from the horrors of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa17">As I come to the end of my statement, I must add that I truly regret the baseless allegations made here this morning by the representative of Syria. His statement was a transparent attempt to divert attention from Syria's own record as a country that supports, encourages, finances and harbours a vast gamut of terrorist organizations. When Syria was elected to the Security Council, the international community had hoped that it would become a more responsible member of the family of nations. After listening to the Syrian statement this morning, I have to conclude that, unfortunately, Syria has so far failed to rise to this challenge.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nejad Hosseinian</span> <span class="nation">Iran</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">Let me begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">The tragic terrorist attacks on 11 September fully illustrate that terrorism is a serious global threat and that all of us are vulnerable to the barbarism and inhumanity that usually are associated with terrorist attacks. Terrorism has no religion, nationality or ethnic background. It is, indeed, the negation of everything religions stand for. Intolerance, extremism and violence have no place in Islam or among its adherents. We must not purport to accord any legitimacy to these acts by associating them even with a misguided reading of Islam, which categorically condemns the killing of a single innocent human being as the equivalent of genocide against all of humankind.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">The Iranian Government condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and by whomever and wherever it is committed. At the same time, Iran has always stressed the need for effective measures to be taken by the international community in a bid to eradicate terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">Here, my Government believes that combating terrorism requires a great deal of collective reflection and wisdom if there is to be a rational and far-sighted response, a response that will focus both on terrorism as a crime and on its root causes, injustice and exclusion, which can be exploited by demagogues to inflict so much harm on innocent human beings.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">As a global menace, terrorism needs a global response founded on inclusion, fairness and international legitimacy. We must eradicate terrorism by changing the prevailing mentality that has provided fertile ground for the growth of this menace. Everyone who is serious about fighting terrorism, especially those in a position of global power, would be well advised not to resort to statements and policies emanating from emotions intertwined with the arrogance of power; these can only further entrench the mentality that produced terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">The United Nations provides a unique mechanism for mobilizing the international community to address terrorism at its roots. It provides the forum necessary for building a universal coalition and can ensure global legitimacy for the long-term response to terrorism. It is indeed an effective mechanism that can draw upon the resources and capabilities of each and every Member State within a rule-based and non-discriminatory framework, thus forging an international consensus in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">In the meantime, it is important that in fighting terrorism we articulate objective criteria that will enable the international community to identify and combat terrorism regardless of the identity of its victims or of its culprits. The legitimacy and sustainability of the global struggle against terrorism rest on applying a single set of standards to all. It is not acceptable that patterns of alliance rather than actual engagement in terrorist activities should become the determining factor. Thus, the credibility of the campaign against terrorism is seriously undermined when policies and practices designed to instil terror and fear among the entire Palestinian people are met with acquiescent silence while resistance to foreign occupation and State terrorism is conveniently demonized. There should be no doubt that acts such as extrajudicial killings, bulldozing the homes of civilians and suffocating people by imposing blockades on residential areas, as perpetrated by the occupying Israeli army against Palestinian civilians, constitute acts of terrorism and should be dealt with accordingly by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">That leads me to stress the principle of the equal rights and self-determination of peoples enshrined in the United Nations Charter and reflected in many resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. Those who fight against foreign occupation in exercise of their legitimate rights should be distinguished from terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">On 27 December 2001, in compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, we submitted the Iranian national report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee, and we stand ready to fully cooperate with the Committee. My Government is also in the process of completing and updating, where necessary, its national instruments with respect to combating terrorism. Here I should like to commend Ambassador Greenstock for the commitment and skill with which he is steering the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. I assure him of our readiness to engage in continued cooperation on the path the Committee is embarked on.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">In combating terrorism at the regional level, last September we closed the Iran-Afghan common border and are closely monitoring the border areas with a view to preventing the movement of Al Qaeda elements. Moreover, we reinstated visa requirements with a number of neighbouring countries, with the aim of preventing unwanted elements from using Iranian territory for crossing over, to or from Afghanistan. Al Qaeda elements have never been able to use Iranian territory, and we are determined to deny them any access to it in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">Iran has an enormously high stake in making sure that peace and stability return to Afghanistan and that terrorism is uprooted in that country. Our efforts towards helping the Afghans establish a broad-based and multi-ethnic Government date back many years. My Government was among the very few that provided all possible assistance to the United Front from the time of its establishment, thereby enabling it to successfully resist the Taliban and their terrorist guests and finally to become instrumental in defeating the Taliban and the terrorists and in establishing the broad-based interim Government.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa12">Iranian officials, consistent in their policy, did their best to help the Afghans reach agreement at the Bonn Conference, and since then have spared no effort in assisting the Afghan interim Government to gain control over the country. The Iranian Foreign Minister attended and addressed the inauguration of the interim Government, and the Afghan Prime Minister has been invited to Iran and is scheduled to visit shortly. In our view, the success of the interim Government is a precondition for the return of stability to Afghanistan and for the uprooting of terrorism there.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Kidwa</span> <span class="non-nation">Palestine</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Permit me to express my satisfaction, Sir, at seeing you, the representative of the friendly country Mauritius, presiding over the work of the Security Council this month. It gives me pleasure also to convey our thanks to the friendly countries whose tenure as members of the Security Council has expired, including Mali, whose Permanent Representative served as President of the Security Council last month. It further gives me pleasure to congratulate the new members of the Council -- Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico and the Syrian Arab Republic -- and to wish them success in their work.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">We endorse the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Morocco in his capacity as Chairman of the Arab Group for this month. It was intended that members of the Group would be content with that statement, because of the Council's wish to hear regional statements in today's debate. But a statement made a short time ago, as expected, prompted us to request to participate in this important discussion; here, we thank you, Mr. President, and the other members of the Council for permitting us to take this valuable opportunity to participate.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">I wish at the outset to express our respect for the efforts of the Counter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and for those of its Chairman, Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">In our statement to the Council on 14 December 2001, we said the following:</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">"On the question of terrorism, the Palestinian side has taken a clear stand against international terrorism and against terrorist groups with a global dimension. The Palestinian side joined the international consensus on this issue following the September disaster in the United States. In line with that clear position -- as well as prior to those events -- we have also rejected suicide bombings carried out in Israel targeting Israeli civilians. We condemn them as terrorist acts, and we view them as incompatible with Palestinian commitments and as acts that harm the national interests of the Palestinian people." (<i><a href="../html/S-PV-4438.html">S/PV.4438</a></i>)</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">That position remains clear and fair, in spite of all the acts carried out by official Israel -- not only by Israeli groups or organizations that committed acts of war against our people -- and regardless of the facts -- which were recalled by the representative of Israel -- prior to and after the establishment of Israel. These were acts that took place under the British mandate, such as the assassination of Count Bernadotte, the Mediator of the United Nations and the massacres committed against our people over the years.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">We also said, with regard to any acts of violence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, that:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg022-bk02-pa08">"We do not support or condone such acts, because we are trying to reach a peaceful negotiated solution. Moreover, we affirm that these acts are incompatible with our commitments, including our commitment to the ceasefire. But we absolutely do not accept any attempt to label those acts as terrorist acts. Over the years, resistance to foreign occupation has been, and it remains, a legitimate right under international law and international humanitarian law. In the Palestinian case, there are no protected Israeli civilians in the occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem. Israeli settlers are there illegally, and were sent in grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and of the first Protocol Additional to the Conventions. They came to colonize Palestinian lands and thus to deny the rights and the existence of our people. I would add that most of the settlers are armed, which makes them illegal combatants or members of militias. Over the years, they have terrorized and attacked Palestinian civilians. One example was the massacre committed by a settler at al-Haram Al-Ibrahimi at Hebron." (<i><a href="../html/S-PV-4438.html">S/PV.4438</a></i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">The acts of these settlers and their safety is the exclusive responsibility of the occupying Power.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">Also, on the basis of the clear provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the First Protocol, we accuse the Government of Mr. Sharon -- the Government of the occupying Power -- of committing war crimes against our people. We also accuse Israel, the occupying Power, of committing State terror against our people. It has been involved in killing civilians and destroying establishments in order to spread terror among the population and to force them to accept its political point of view.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">The responsibility of the international community is very clear, as is the responsibility of the Security Council, particularly in the light of this campaign against international terror. It was encouraging to listen here to the representative of Israel speaking in a very uncustomary way of the need to abide by the resolutions of the Security Council. In this respect, we admit that we did not understand the reference this morning to the lack of a legal basis for the term "State terrorism". If a certain act constitutes terrorism, is considered terrorism, it is terrorism, whether it was committed by individuals, organizations or States.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa12">Moreover, how could there be a term such as "State-sponsored terrorism" if there were no such thing as State terrorism? If individuals sponsored by a Government commit a terrorist act, it is terrorism. Israel is a State that sponsors terrorism. However, if the same act is perpetrated by people working within the structures of a State, is this not State terrorism?</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa13">We believe that this strange talk cannot serve our common objectives in combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, whenever and wherever it happens.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa14">Such a discussion may underline the importance of finishing the work of the General Assembly in putting the final touches on the comprehensive convention on terrorism. We and many Member States have adopted a very flexible position, hoping to crown our efforts with success. Unfortunately, some insist on using this flexibility in the service of illegitimate political interests. Worse still, some are actually trying to change some of the rules of international law and international humanitarian law. They are trying to accomplish what appears to be a negation of the First Protocol of the Geneva Conventions. This is illogical and does not serve the interests of the international community with regard to combating terrorism. We call on all Member States to make some additional efforts to arrive at the necessary solutions and accomplish this major achievement, which will assist the international community in combating international terrorism in a more effective manner.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I thank the Permanent Observer of Palestine for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Tajikistan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Alimov</span> <span class="nation">Tajikistan</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">First, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month, and I thank you for convening this meeting of the Security Council devoted to one of the most pressing questions for humanity today.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">Tajikistan is fully dedicated to the extremely important cause of cooperation with the United Nations and its Member States in combating international terrorism. For well known reasons, an understanding of the need for an active fight against terrorism was formed in Tajikistan even before the barbarous attacks on the United States on 11 September, which the Government of Tajikistan has condemned in the strongest terms. As long ago as November 1999, our country's Parliament adopted a special law on counter-terrorism. Today Tajikistan is a party to most universal international conventions in this area of international cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">In the fight against international terrorism, we are continuing to interact with other States parties to the Treaty on Collective Security and the members of the Shanghai Organization of Cooperation. The adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by the Security Council, of course, provided a powerful impetus to this fight worldwide. The resolution served as yet one more proof of the international community's determination to cooperate closely to prevent and suppress terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">It is extremely important not only that this resolution strengthen the instruments existing within the United Nations system to combat terrorism, but also that it play a decisive role in developing a global mechanism to counter terrorism. The Security Council has assumed the role of leader in this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">It is noteworthy that in the short span of 90 days, the Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee has managed to complete many of its tasks. We consider that the effectiveness of the Committee's work is due to a great extent to the purposeful, consistent and very energetic action of its Chairman, Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock. We reaffirm our profound interest in the Committee and in expanding cooperation with it, including through receiving advisory and technical assistance. Tajikistan is wholly dedicated to the cause of fully implementing its obligations and responsibilities under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">In order to harmonize all the legislation of the Republic of Tajikistan with the Security Council resolution, a well-developed and very specific special decree was adopted by the Government. The coordinating body responsible for the implementation of the provisions of the Council resolution was the country's Ministry of Security. By a separate decree, the President of Tajikistan, Emomali Rakhmonov, the Central Bank was instructed to take measures, including the prompt freezing of funds and other financial assets of persons and organizations that carry out, participate in or assist in the commission of terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">In the context of counter-terrorism, Tajikistan is giving close attention to further intensifying the battle against illegal drug trafficking. We are supported and assisted in this work by the United Nations Drug Control Programme. Recent events have again shown that counter-terrorism is one of the most important problems facing humanity today. We share the view that the struggle will be long and difficult. A leading role in counter-terrorism will continue to lie with the United Nations and the Security Council. Tajikistan, for its part, will make every possible additional effort to expand cooperation with all interested States, including within the United Nations, in order to make a tangible contribution to the common fight against international terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Belinga-Eboutou</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa01">Allow me to thank you, Mr. President, for</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa02">taking the timely initiative of organizing this public debate of the Security Council on the fight against terrorism and in particular on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September 2001 on this matter. We are especially appreciative of the format and the structure chosen to involve the non-members of the Council in the debate. We believe that this formula deserves to be considered as a possible model.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa03">I wish to express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for his enlightening statement, which highlighted the links between terrorism and transnational crime. That statement also had the merit of emphasizing the need for consistent and coordinated action.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa04">I wish to associate myself with the unanimous tribute paid to our colleague the Ambassador of Mexico, who has placed at our disposal his vast legal knowledge and long experience. Ambassador Navarrete presided with particular skill and tact over the sanctions Committee on Sierra Leone. Mr. Ambassador, our warm wishes for success go with you.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa05">I now wish to pay a well-deserved and heartfelt tribute to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, for the remarkable work the Committee has been able to accomplish in less than four months under his wise and able leadership. I also wish to thank him for the information he provided us this morning concerning the laudable efforts made in the context of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa06">We have learned that guidelines for the submission of the reports under paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> have been prepared. A list of national contact points in the fight against terrorism has also been drawn up. Finally, a group of experts has been established to help the Committee in its work. Furthermore, we are particularly reassured by the significant number of States that, in keeping with the relevant provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, have made their reports to the Committee concerning the measures they have taken or plan to take in pursuance of that resolution. Undoubtedly, that is a further sign of the international community's renewed determination to stand united against this scourge of modern times -- terrorism -- and to relentlessly pursue its perpetrators and their accomplices.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa07">The rapid and resolute response of the international community to the attacks on the United States on 11 September is particularly significant. It means that the world will not allow itself to be taken hostage by terrorists, their accomplices and their instigators.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa08">The global character of terrorism and its evident links with transnational crime necessarily mean, as was recalled this morning by the Secretary-General, that there must be a global and concerted response by the international community in fighting this phenomenon. All States, therefore, have the duty to make frank and constructive contributions to international efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa09">With respect to Cameroon, President Paul Biya has vigorously expressed the indignation of the people of Cameroon at the attacks of 11 September and has affirmed our country's resolve to take an active part in the fight against this scourge. The message that the President addressed to the diplomatic corps at the traditional New Year's ceremony was a message devoted entirely to this subject, a further strong sign of Cameroon's unequivocal commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa10">As stated by the President of the Republic, for Cameroon nothing can justify terrorist acts that, by definition, can affect only the innocent. Terrorism is intolerable, and it must be combated in all its forms. The unacceptable practices, the fear, the hatred and the intolerance that it fosters constitute both a source of major concern and a grave threat to international peace and security. Cameroon believes, as our head of State has said, that in order to put an end to terrorism we must also bring peace to the international context by overcoming situations of injustice that serve as a breeding ground from which intolerance springs and that can serve as an easy pretext.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa11">Cameroon has taken the necessary steps for the implementation in its territory of the measures contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. At the internal level, appropriate legislation making it possible to combat terrorist activities has been adopted. Measures have been taken by the security services to prevent our territory from serving as a theatre for terrorist acts or activities linked to terrorism. Finally, a focal point has been designated in the office of the President of the Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa12">At the international level, Cameroon has acceded to the majority of the counter-terrorist legal instruments and has participated at the African regional level in the development of conventions and strategies to combat this scourge within the framework of the Organization of African Unity.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa13">Cameroon intends to continue to give the Counter-Terrorism Committee all necessary support, especially by participating actively in its work. We lend our unreserved support to the programme of work that has been presented to us by the Chairman of the Committee, and we reiterate to him our full satisfaction with the manner in which he has thus far conducted the Committee's work, in a spirit of complete transparency, especially through regular briefings, and we encourage him to continue in this way.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa14">In the consideration of the question of terrorism by the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, Cameroon stressed the need for assistance to developing countries in order to strengthen their national and regional capacity to combat terrorism. We welcome paragraph 4 of the programme of action. Our concerns have been taken especially into account, and we look forward to these offers of assistance and will be particularly pleased to hear from the Chairman of the Committee about what the Committee can and intends to do to strengthen national and regional capacities, especially in organizing training and information seminars.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa15">I would like to say a few words about the legal instruments for combating terrorism. The suppression of terrorism is a particularly fertile field of international law, but the existing conventions, for the most part, pertain to specific categories of terrorist acts. Thus they cannot constitute an appropriate response likely to enhance the effectiveness of international cooperation. This is all the more so in that some continue to take advantage of legal lacunae in order to commit terrorist acts. This is why we would suggest that the Council encourage the Ad Hoc Committee on terrorism that will soon be meeting in New York to complete urgently the development of a comprehensive convention on terrorism. We likewise believe that this Ad Hoc Committee should be invited to complete the draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa16">It remains for me to express our gratitude to our colleagues for the congratulations and kind words addressed to Cameroon upon its accession to the Council.</p>

	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Cameroon for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Navarrete</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, I wish at the outset to say how very gratified my delegation is at the objective, impartial and transparent manner in which you are conducting the Council debate. I warmly congratulate you.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">My delegation associates itself with the statement made this morning by the Ambassador of Costa Rica on behalf of the countries members of the Rio Group. We also find many of his views reflected in the statement made this afternoon on behalf of the countries of the Caribbean Community by Ambassador Durrant of Jamaica.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">We are also grateful for the statement made by the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee this morning, which made it possible to focus today's debate on the present and future work of the Committee -- a fundamental task of this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">Mexico has already, on other occasions, expressed its firm commitment to the fight against international terrorism and has referred to the specific actions it has taken. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> provides an additional tool to enhance the effectiveness of our efforts to eradicate terrorism. The heinous attacks of 11 September made clear the extreme seriousness of current manifestations of terrorism and the need to work in unison to prevent criminal groups from sowing terror and destruction among the population.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">My country reaffirms once again its readiness to continue to work to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the agreements adopted in other United Nations forums, inter alia the General Assembly. It is clear that the broad legal framework established by the international community over the years provides the foundations for lasting cooperation. Applied in good faith and without double standards, it should allow us effectively to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">Mexico has submitted to the Council the report referred to in paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and will continue to take the necessary measures for its implementation, including in the framework of North America, with joint or coordinated actions by its three countries in areas such as border control, exchange of information, monitoring of financial transfers and arms trafficking, among many other areas.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">I should like to limit my statement to a presentation of Mexico's view of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and its future orientation.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">The Committee's objective is to enable States to enhance their level of response in combating terrorism. In order to reach that goal, it is essential to ensure transparency and objectivity in the conduct of its work; the broadest possible dialogue among its members and the other States Members of the Organization; and close coordination with other forums that are applying measures similar to those contemplated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa09">These very elements -- transparency, objectivity, dialogue and coordination -- have characterized the actions taken thus far by the Committee. I should like to express my delegation's appreciation to its Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for the manner in which he has conducted its work, and I express once again Mexico's resolute support for his work. I am likewise grateful for the outstanding contributions of the three Vice-Chairmen of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa10">It has been said here by the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee himself that the Committee is not a tribunal, but, rather, finds in international cooperation its natural scope of action, since that is the only way to combat and eradicate terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa11">Technical assistance, when it is required by concerned States, is a key element in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Committee must assist States in overcoming any difficulties they may have encountered in the implementation of the resolution, especially that one third of the total number of Members of our Organization that have not yet been able to submit their initial report to the Committee and the Council. Accordingly, I would like to know what orientations Ambassador Greenstock might be able to suggest in order to lend more effective assistance to those that truly need it, in addition to the measures already taken -- for example, the expansion and further development of the directory of assistance that has been compiled by the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa12">Operative paragraph 4 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> alludes to the close link between international terrorism and other forms of criminal conduct. Many of the representatives who have spoken in today's debate have also underscored this point. Various international institutions competent in this regard have shown a willingness closely to cooperate with the United Nations and to assist States in the implementation of that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa13">A satisfactory dialogue has been launched with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Financial Action Task Force in the area of combating money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. That dialogue should encourage the efficient use of resources and avert any duplication of efforts, and it should effectively contribute to enhancing the technical capacity of States in combating terrorism. Also important, in my delegation's view, is the work done by the International Atomic Energy Agency in combating nuclear terrorism. Dialogue and coordination should be extended to other forums in which measures to eradicate terrorism are currently under discussion.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa14">The implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> should be consistent with the multilateral legal framework. In particular, it should be ensured that joint or separate measures taken by members in cooperation with the Organization are carried out in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, including standards of human rights and international humanitarian law, as well as the protection of genuine cases of asylum and refuge.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa15">As has been said here, in order to be effective, the fight against terrorism must be fully compatible with the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Otherwise, our efforts will be counterproductive.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa16">Mexico hopes that the renewed spirit of cooperation that prevails in the United Nations will lead to the successful conclusion of the work of the special Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/210</a>. We are encouraged by the statements we heard throughout the day with respect to the prospects for its work. It is to be hoped, therefore, that, during its sixth session, pending issues can be resolved and progress made in the adoption of new international instruments, thus strengthening the framework for fighting international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa17">Accordingly, Mexico deems it indispensable that there be a prompt conclusion of the draft comprehensive convention on terrorism, an instrument that will endow the international community with a more uniform framework in combating this scourge and will make it possible to cover all of those forms of terrorism that are not specifically contemplated in other agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa18">Allow me in conclusion to exercise my right not to reply but to express thanks. I have heard very kind words spoken throughout this meeting. I am most grateful for them. It has been a privilege for me to represent Mexico in this Organization in the year that has brought my country to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa19">I would ask my colleagues in the Council and, more generally, the representatives to the Organization, to extend to my successor, Ambassador Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, the same frank cooperation and generous friendship with which you have honoured me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Mexico for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa02">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Mauritius.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa03">First of all, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Ambassador Greenstock, for his comprehensive and informative briefing on the work of the Committee. We would like to join other delegations in paying special tribute to him for the excellent work he is doing in the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa04">The 11 September attacks proved once again that combating international terrorism is not only important in its own right, but also remains the main priority of the international community, regional organizations and individual States. We came to realize that no country, whether big or small, rich or poor, developed or developing, could ensure its security from such dastardly attacks carried out by terrorists. International terrorism has, therefore, become a pressing, complex and unpredictable global challenge that needs urgent attention at all levels. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which is a binding and mandatory collective approach to ridding the world of the scourge of terrorism, is a most appropriate step in that regard, and it requires unanimous support by all of us.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa05">The overwhelming response from States within the targeted time limit for the submission of national reports, is a feat in itself. The large number of reports received to date reflects the seriousness of the issue and also the dedication and commitment of Member States to the implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. This shows the strong and resolute determination of one and all to do away with the plague that international terrorism represents. However, we cannot be complacent. As one of the major threats to humanity, terrorism has made our task more daunting. We are confident that by 27 March 2002, the review of the first set of reports will be completed. In this regard, my delegation urges those States that have not yet submitted their national reports to do so expeditiously.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa06">Combating international terrorism will not be easy without a comprehensive and collective plan of action. This is a fight in which all States need to act promptly and decisively. Failure on the part of one State can break the chain of support that the international community desperately needs in order to combat -- by all means and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations -- the threat to international peace and security posed by terrorist acts. All States should, therefore, collaborate fully in the implementation of the provisions of the resolution and put in place necessary mechanisms at the national level with a view to ridding the world of the scourge of international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa07">At the national level in my country, every effort is geared towards the prevention and suppression of terrorist acts. In this regard, we are cooperating fully with the international and regional organizations for the implementation of the relevant international and regional conventions relating to terrorism. In March this year, the National Assembly of Mauritius will consider the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, the Financial Intelligence and Anti-Money-Laundering Bill, and the Criminal and Related Matters (Mutual Assistance) Bill. The Prevention of Terrorism Bill includes all the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in the fight against terrorism. We are convinced that the proposed bills will consolidate the measures already in place for dealing with terrorist acts and their financing.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa08">On a regional basis, at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence and Security, held in Luanda, Angola, on 18 December 2001, Mauritius, along with other SADC members, underscored the need for regional mechanisms and a coordinated approach to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. As parties to the Luanda Declaration, member States unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and undertook to accede or ratify international instruments on combating terrorism, adopted by the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, and to incorporate them into domestic laws. They also agreed to cooperate at all levels in the exchange of information and the identification of persons, institutions and networks associated with terrorism, and to prevent SADC members from being used as bases or support centres for groups of individuals involved in terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa09">The fight against international terrorism is indeed peculiar in that it requires close cooperation within and among regions on related issues, such as the suppression of drug trafficking, traffic in small arms and light weapons and money-laundering. We believe a strong commitment to addressing the problem of poverty would be helpful as a priority, since poverty is one of the breeding grounds for terrorism in most cases. My delegation strongly supports all the regional approaches adopted thus far in addressing these issues, as required under paragraph 4 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa10">My delegation fully supports the methodology of work adopted by the Committee. The transparency and even-handedness that have now become the rule of thumb of the work of the Committee give the necessary assurance to Member States that all norms of objectivity and impartiality are being strictly observed and applied. The Committee, being only a monitoring body, is not here to pass judgement or to be interpreted as a police force. It is a working organism, as the Chairman rightly pointed out in his briefing, to assist States in the implementation of all the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa11">With the guidance for Member States in the preparation of their respective national reports, and the appointment of a pool of experts to assist the Committee as well as Member States requiring assistance in various fields in the implementation process, we are convinced that the mandate of the Committee, as set out in the resolution, will be fulfilled within the prescribed time frame.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa12">Since terrorism strikes at the very heart of everything for which the United Nations stands and represents a global threat to democracy, the rule of law, human rights and stability, a truly concerted international effort to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is what we require. The Committee can be an important tool in this regard, and we are pleased to see that it is resolved to fulfil its mandate in the most dedicated manner.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa13">Before I conclude, I would like to pay tribute once again to our colleague from Mexico, to whom we bid a very fond farewell. We will certainly miss him greatly.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa14">I resume my function as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa15">I shall now give the floor to Sir Jeremy Greenstock to respond to questions and comments made.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">What I say in response to this debate today is in my personal capacity as Chairman, but I think members of the Committee will not find difficulty in what I am about to say.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa02">All of us on the Committee are extremely grateful for the support of the membership as a whole for what we are trying to do under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We have had a series of very clear expressions of that support during the debate today. I find it very effective that we are able to interweave in our debate interventions with statements by members of the Council. Transparency is important in what we are doing, not as a gesture or a way of advancing the wider interests of the Security Council, but because it is necessary and in the interests of all to make the counter-terrorism fight effective. The point is that we are working together in this effort, and there is no doubt that we shall continue doing so -- here we wish to reassure the representative of Nepal, among others.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa03">The fact that we are building a consensus on this subject and the fact that it is now a practical proposition that we have a global approach to combating terrorism is a very real instrument in suppressing the horrendous use of violence that we have seen in the past, particularly in the recent past. I felt that in the debate today the overwhelming majority of those who spoke had this in their minds as a very clear concept: that we should maximize our area of consensus on what we are dealing with and how we deal with it, and focus on making the efforts of our Committee as effective as possible within that area.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa04">I think that it would be right to add one or two points of advice to all Member States about what is coming up in the next period. The process of going through the reports -- which, as members of the Committee know, we are evolving as we go along with the already extraordinarily effective help from our experts -- is going to be a rolling, ongoing process. That is why we want States to attend the meetings with the subcommittees, which Ireland, among others, referred to in its statement. It is not that we are looking for immediate answers from Member States at that point, but that we want Member States to be as familiar as possible with the process that we are entering into. It is going to go through several stages. Nobody is likely to avoid questions and follow-up from the Committee. I think Member States need to expect, over the coming months, quite an exchange with the Committee in making sure that their capability to meet the obligations of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is improved and enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa05">A lot of speakers, in that context, asked about assistance. Ambassador Navarrete has just enlarged on that point and asked for further orientation. We are putting together a directory so that Member States can be self-starting in seeking assistance. But the Committee itself will also be a guide for putting Member States in touch with the most relevant areas of assistance, which include the international institutions, including parts of the United Nations, the bilateral agreements and arrangements that are in place and may be increased as a result of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and our efforts, and the Counter-Terrorism Committee itself, including its experts, who will be evolving advice on the assistance that will be available.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa06">Money is part of that, but the most important sources of advice and assistance are really the models -- the model legislation for each cultural area -- and the examples of process and of machinery that Member States can find in their own region or from like-minded Member States. It is in that area that the Committee intends to increase its liaison arrangements, perhaps by appointing further experts, so that we know what other institutions are going to do, we know in more detail what is available for Member States and we have a follow-up with Member States themselves as to precisely how they can use those areas. So in the weeks and months to come, there will be further advice coming out on assistance, in addition to the directory, which I think will be of real practical help to Member States that need to turn to others to make their own performance as effective as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa07">There is also a very strong emphasis in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> on financial control. Ambassador Valdivieso majored on that in his statement -- I think absolutely rightly -- and we will be liaising with the financial institutions, not least with the Financial Action Task Force. The Hong Kong meeting of the Financial Action Task Force and the meeting in the margins of that particular conference to talk about group arrangements to take forward the area of financial control will be a matter of attention for this Committee, and we will link in with it.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa08">But I think that the most important expression we have heard today of further organization to meet obligations has been at the regional level. I counted 12 expressions, formal or otherwise, of regional interest: the European Union; the Rio Group; the Arab Group; the Warsaw Group; the Caribbean Community; the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; Association of South-East Asian Nations; the Group of Eight; the Pacific Islands Forum; the Organization of the Islamic Conference; the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation; and the Central Asian States. I think that is a marvellous response.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa09">In that area as well, I think the Committee should think of particular points of liaison. It may be that there, too, we should have in mind experts who can link in with the regional organizations, particularly experts with experience in those regions who can do work for us, or part-time work for us, in taking forward regional cooperation, because maximizing the operational capability of regions to help each other and to work together to keep terrorists and support for terrorists out may be where we make the most advances. I think the Committee is going to need to concentrate on that area very effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa10">So, as many have said -- I think I noted Bangladesh said it first -- there is no room for complacency in what we are doing. There are some very hard tasks, not least in making sure that we maximize cohesion rather than division in how we approach this politically. The Committee has made a wonderful start in doing that, because members of the Committee have wanted to do it that way. Again, I thank them and the members of the Bureau in particular for making that possible. There is a huge amount of work to do in the coming weeks. That is going to be quite a test for everybody, and we will report back to the Security Council gladly when we have gone through that searing experience.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg031-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa01">My delegation would like to reply briefly to the unfounded claims contained in the statement made by the representative of Israel.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa02">It is well known that Israel was the party that brought terrorism to the Middle East, and I find no reason to recall -- especially given that we are here in the Security Council Chamber -- the millions of Syrian and Palestinian refugees, the Qana massacre, the Sabra and Shatila massacre and the massacre of the Cave of the Patriarchs, among others, let alone the continued Israeli occupation of Arab territories. Once again, we ask, if this is not terrorism, what is it?</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa03">Syria aids, assists and gives shelter to about a half million Palestinian refugees. The representative of Israel takes pleasure in calling them terrorists, while they have been victims of Israeli terror since 1948. We in Syria have only information and social offices that represent the Palestinian people and those who have been displaced.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa04">The members of the international community have made clear their confidence in Syria: by more than the required majority, they elected Syria to membership of the Security Council. Syria did not succeed in that election by meeting Israel's criteria for success: occupation, killing, terrorism and destruction. At any rate, we do not believe that Israel is in the best position to claim to speak for the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa05">Looking at this from another perspective, all delegations that spoke in the Council today warmly congratulated us on our accession to membership of the Council. That reflects confidence that we cherish and provides our response to the claims of the representative of Israel. We affirm to all present that we will most assuredly strive to be worthy of that confidence.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa06">In short, let me reiterate on behalf of the Syrian Arab Republic that Syria, as it always has been, is prepared to work with every country in the world, from East to West, from North to South, to fight terrorism and to eradicate the scourge it represents. We are prepared to do this immediately and unconditionally. We have made that intention clear to all who have visited Damascus. We are engaged in close cooperation with all countries that have requested and sought such cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa07">I reaffirm in conclusion that our struggle and resistance against Israeli occupation of Arab territories are a just and legitimate struggle by the terms of the Charter and international legitimacy.</p>
