<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">Under the item on its agenda, the Security Council will now begin its consideration of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members concerning the application of Tuvalu for admission to membership in the United Nations, which appears in <a href="../pdf/S-2000-70.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/70</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">In paragraph 3 of the report, the Committee recommends to the Council that it should have recourse to the provision of the last paragraph of rule 60 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure in order to present its recommendation to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Council wishes to waive the time limits set forth in the penultimate paragraph of rule 60.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">In paragraph 4 of the report, the Committee recommends to the Security Council the adoption of a draft resolution on the application of Tuvalu for admission to membership in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution contained in paragraph 4 of the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members (<a href="../pdf/S-2000-70.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/70</a>).

	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">The Chinese delegation attaches great importance to Tuvalu's desire to join the United Nations and has seriously considered its application. The Chinese delegation believes that, as a State Member of the United Nations, a country should truly fulfil the obligations contained in the Charter of the United Nations and strictly abide by the resolutions of the General Assembly. This is also a very important basis on which to judge whether an applicant country has met the standards for being a Member of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">In considering the question of Tuvalu's joining the United Nations, we believe that the most important thing is the upholding of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the implementation of General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">Proceeding from this principled position, the Chinese delegation cannot support the Security Council's recommendation to the General Assembly that Tuvalu should be accepted as a new Member State.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">At the same time, bearing in mind the long-term interests of the peoples of China and Tuvalu, and also taking into consideration the requests of various parties, including the countries of the South Pacific, we will not block this recommendation. It is our hope that, after joining the United Nations, Tuvalu will strictly abide by the Charter of the United Nations and implement General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI).</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk13-pa06">"The Council notes with great satisfaction Tuvalu's solemn commitment to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to fulfil all the obligations contained therein.</p>
