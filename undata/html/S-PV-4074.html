	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them two reports of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti, documents <a href="../pdf/S-1999-908.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/908</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1999-1184.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/1184</a>.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lelong</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Allow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on the way in which you have conducted the work of the Council during the month of November, which is coming to a close. I would also like to express my appreciation to your predecessor, Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, who presided over the Council in the month of October.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The mandate of the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) -- which was extended through the Council's adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1212(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1212 (1998)</a> at its 3949th meeting, on 25 November 1998 -- comes to an end today.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The task of MIPONUH was to continue to assist the Haitian Government by providing support and assistance to ensure the professionalization of the National Police, in particular through mentoring activities and strengthening the capability of the central directorate to manage international aid provided to it from bilateral and multilateral sources.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">MIPONUH and the various missions that preceded it in Haiti, beginning with the deployment of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) on 31 March 1995, which took over from the multinational force, have all successfully carried out their mandates in a positive environment. The Security Council, which authorized them, can be proud of this fact.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">However, much remains to be done. The battle for democracy has not yet been won. We have come a long way, and important and significant results have been achieved, but threatening elements remain that could reverse the trend towards progress.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">Institution-building is being pursued, despite many difficulties. Domestic problems and external pressures threaten to weaken and undermine these institutions, impeding their progress towards full development and the achievement of professionalism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The role of the Haitian National Police and the work that has been done have been made even more difficult by the magnitude of the problems affecting the well-being of our people and the constraints that are hampering development. These fundamental problems are both a cause and a symptom of the delayed progress in the country, and they stand in the way of a response to the pressing needs of the great majority of the people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">In this context, I would refer to paragraph 8 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1212(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1212 (1998)</a>, which invites United Nations bodies and agencies, especially the Economic and Social Council, to contribute to the designing of a long-term assistance programme to my country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">The Economic and Social Council responded to that appeal by adopting resolution <a href="../pdf/E-1999-L.35.pdf" class="nolink">E/1999/L.35</a>, which is the fruit of intensive work on the part of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">The groundwork has been laid for a new approach to the assistance lent by the international community to countries emerging from crises. In the case of my country, we have a new challenge to meet, and a major one at that: that of translating into reality the various recommendations contained in the resolution adopted by the Economic and Social Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">In his report to the Security Council (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-1184.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/1184</a>) of 18 November, the Secretary-General, in discussing possible assistance for Haiti after 30 November 1999, states that a new mission could carry out the tasks currently handled by MIPONUH and the International Civilian Mission in Haiti (MICIVIH), with the aim of assisting the Government in sectors that are of crucial importance for the promotion of democracy, such as the police force, justice and human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">The Secretary-General noted that it can be said that MIPONUH has made a considerable contribution to institutional development and to reforming the Haitian police, and he added that the expiration of its mandate marks the end of peacekeeping operations in Haiti. I would add that it highlights the necessary role of society in the peaceful settlement of its conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">In the light of these considerations, the President of the Republic of Haiti, René Préval, in his letter to the Secretary-General dated 8 November, expressed thanks to the United Nations for deploying the Mission, which has made a valuable contribution to enhancing police performance and the country's stability. However, to build on the work already done, the international community's support in this area will continue to be necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">Accordingly, the Republic of Haiti would like an institutional support mission set up, whose members would be neither uniformed nor armed, to support the democratization process, assisting the Haitian Government in strengthening the judiciary and professionalizing the Haitian National Police.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/S-1999-1202.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/1202</a> on the transition phase to the International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH), as well as the draft resolution establishing that Mission, which is before the General Assembly in <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.36.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/L.36</a>, reflects these concerns, and we hope that they will be approved by the respective bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">In conclusion, I wish to express the gratitude of the Government and people of Haiti to all those who have shown understanding and support in our difficult path towards meeting the requirements of democracy, development and justice, in particular the group of friends of the Secretary-General on the question of Haiti, the sponsors of the draft resolution before us.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Haiti for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-1202.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/1202</a>) before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">I shall first give the floor to those members of the Council who wish to makes statements before the voting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gatilov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">The Russian Federation will abstain in the voting on the draft resolution on the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti for reasons of principle that can be summarized as follows.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">First, by extending the mandate of the Mission, the Security Council once again is in breach of its own decision and truly is placing itself in an absurd position. The fact that in the text the words "to continue" are used instead of "to extend the mandate" does not change the essence of the matter. We view it as merely an attempt to camouflage the true meaning of this event.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Secondly, and most importantly, the President of Haiti, René Préval, in his letter dated 8 November, clearly set forth his position. He thanked the United Nations for the work of the Civilian Police Mission in Haiti and expressed the desire that a new mission be established whose members would be neither uniformed nor armed. This approach is at variance with what is stated in the draft resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">We believe that the Security Council should not take a decision to extend the mandate of the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti since no official written request to that effect from the Haitian Government has been received.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">In conclusion, we deem it important to emphasize that the Russian Federation will support the establishment of the International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti, because we are convinced of the need for a further United Nations presence in that country. The main thing is that this presence should be multifaceted and should not be at variance with the wishes of the host country.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Petrella</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa01">We have adopted a primarily technical measure aimed at facilitating a smooth transition between the missions that are currently deployed. I am referring to the International Civilian Mission in Haiti (MICIVIH) and the Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH), and to the new International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH), the draft resolution on which will be considered shortly in the General Assembly. The Secretary-General, in paragraph 44 of his most recent report (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-1184.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/1184</a>), recognizes the need to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa02">The adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1212(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1212 (1998)</a> began a process of coordination among the main bodies of this Organization. On the basis of <a href="../pdf/E-RES-1999-11.pdf" class="nolink">Economic and Social Council resolution 1999/11</a>, the group of the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti, in consultation with the Secretariat and the Government of Haiti, prepared the draft resolution creating the International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH), which is endorsed by the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa03">We affirm that the resolution that we have just adopted is almost unprecedented in the history of the United Nations. We are completing one of the final links in the process of coordinating the various stages involved in conflict resolution. Peacekeeping -- the purpose of the Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) and the other missions which preceded it -- is now being followed by the consolidation of peace, governmental institutions and a democratic system. At every stage, each of the main bodies involved has carried out its task to the fullest. Argentina expressed its commitment to support the democratic institutions in our sister country of Haiti by providing resources and military and police personnel since the beginning of the United Nations presence.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa04">Once again, we express our thanks to all the members of the Council who have accepted this technical and transitional extension. I also take this opportunity to thank Mr. Julian Harston for the excellent way in which he carried out his tasks as the Representative of the Secretary-General, and we welcome his replacement, Mr. Alfredo Lopes Cabral, to whom we offer our full support in the accomplishment of that same task.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Soderberg</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa01">The United States strongly endorses this proposal to continue the Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) until 15 March 2000. This action gives the United Nations the valuable time needed to recruit the technically skilled personnel required to fulfil the mandate of the follow-on mission, the International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH). The creation of the new mission represents a new stage in the international community's partnership with Haiti. It carries forward the work of MIPONUH and its predecessors to build a highly professional police force, begun after the 1994 restoration of democracy. But it also moves this partnership in new directions.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa02">The transition over the next several months from MIPONUH to MICAH reflects the changing realities in the type of international help most suitable for today's Haiti. The difficult work of creating a professional police force is now behind us, as the nearly 6,000 recruits of several years ago have matured into seasoned officers. We must now focus on ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Haitian National Police. To do this, the international community needs to concentrate on deepening the mid-level to senior-level management capabilities of the force, helping it to better manage programmes, funds, equipment and personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa03">In this new role, the armed and uniformed international civilian police currently in Haiti will be replaced by technical advisors -- typically, in their home countries such advisers are senior police officials -- who will work in Port-au-Prince and in each of Haiti's nine <i>départements </i>to develop a competent cadre of Haitian police commanders and managers.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa04">We must also be candid in our assessment of the current situation in Haiti and recognize that the justice system has failed to keep pace with the progress of the police. In fact, unless addressed quickly, the weakness of the judicial sector could undermine our long work with the Haitian National Police. Additionally, the flaws in the administration of justice present a long-term threat to the protection of the basic human rights of the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa05">Therefore, it is appropriate that the pillar of support that MICAH will provide to the Haitian police will also be joined by separate, but nevertheless mutually reinforcing, efforts to strengthen the judicial sector and improve respect for human rights in Haiti over the long term. Through the efforts of MIPONUH, its predecessors and the International Civilian Mission in Haiti, the international community has helped Haiti to advance in areas critical to any just and democratic society. But the job is not yet done, and today we take the next step in our partnership with Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cordeiro</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Brazil was a sponsor of the draft resolution just adopted by the Council, extending the mandate of the Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) until March 2000. We are confident that the General Assembly will shortly approve the establishment of a new integrated mission in Haiti to assist in the critical areas of police training, the electoral process, justice and human rights, which are vital for the consolidation of democracy in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The establishment of the new International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH) will allow for the conclusion of the Security Council's peacekeeping involvement in Haiti. International assistance will from now on concentrate on the transition to peace-building through a long-term support programme with the direct participation of the donor community and United Nations bodies and agencies, including the Bretton Woods institutions. With this perspective in mind, the decision taken by the Council today will allow the necessary time for a smooth transition until the new mission becomes fully operational.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The transition to new forms of international assistance for Haiti responds directly to the concerns expressed in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1212(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1212 (1998)</a>, adopted by the Security Council one year ago. We are pleased to note the instrumental and very effective contribution made by the Economic and Social Council in helping to shape this new model for the United Nations presence in Haiti. We take pride in the fact that it was at the initiative of Ambassador Celso Amorim that a specific invitation to the Economic and Social Council to contribute to the designing of a long-term programme of support for Haiti was included in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1212(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1212 (1998)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Brazil was also one of the five members of the Advisory Group that prepared the recommendations approved by the Economic and Social Council in response to that invitation. We are of the view that this test case has opened the way to further strengthen the collaboration of the two Councils in addressing questions related to the transition from peacekeeping to peace-building in post-conflict situations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Haiti finds itself at a critical juncture. The adoption of this resolution will send a powerful message that the international community remains committed to assisting the Haitian people. It is also an expression of our resolve to ensure consistency and continuity in the efforts to support long-term stability for Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">Finally, we want to express our gratitude to the delegation of Canada, together with the other members of the group of the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti, for having led that process in close consultation with the Government of Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chen Xu</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The Chinese delegation has always supported the efforts made by the United Nations to assist the Haitian people to overcome their political crisis and begin economic reconstruction. We appreciate the efforts made by the Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) and the International Civilian Mission in Haiti (MICIVIH) in assisting the Haitian people in their reconstruction efforts. We have noted that President Préval of Haiti, in his letter dated 8 November, expressed hope that the United Nations would continue to support the peace process in Haiti and set up a new mission at an early date. In this regard, we support the proposal of the Secretary-General to set up the International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH). We hope that the General Assembly will take a decision on a relevant resolution at an early date.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">We believe that when the overall situation in Haiti is stable, the United Nations should focus its efforts on helping Haiti to fight poverty and restore its economy. Therefore, we have always held the view that, given the overall situation, MIPONUH should consider completing its work so that the relevant agencies can play a greater role in peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">We have just voted in favour of extending MIPONUH by three months in consideration of the fact that there is a need for a smooth transition from MIPONUH to MICAH.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">We sincerely hope that Haiti will be able to maintain stability and, with the assistance of the international community, will stride forward towards the early achievement of peace, stability and development.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Duval</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">Canada introduced the draft resolution whose adoption has made it possible to continue the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) until 15 March 2000. We did this at the end of a long process regarding the transition from peacekeeping missions to missions of post-conflict peace-building and reconstruction. It is important to recall that it was Brazil that brought this matter to the Council and that, as that country's representative has noted, Brazil has worked in the Economic and Social Council and along with the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti to define a new approach to making the transition from peacekeeping missions to peace-building missions.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">We supported the resolution because we agree with the conclusions set out in the 18 November 1999 report of the Secretary-General on MIPONUH. MIPONUH has made an important contribution to the institutional development attained by the police force and to reform of that force, and it has helped to establish the basis for the development of an independent and professional police service in Haiti. Moreover, the work of the Representative of the Secretary-General in Haiti has provided the political presence the international community needs for coordinated and effective monitoring of Haitian efforts. These achievements of MIPONUH make it possible to move today, at the request of President Préval, to a more flexible mechanism adapted to the priority needs of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">The future International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH), which is being considered by the General Assembly, will complete the ongoing transition from a military peacekeeping presence to a civilian police presence evolving towards a long-term programme of cooperation. MICAH has been designed to provide wider-ranging, better targeted and better coordinated support for Haiti while reducing the number of staff and the total cost of the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Haiti and the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti, which prepared the General Assembly draft resolution on this matter, are focusing on the difficult period that follows the termination of a peacekeeping mission. They understand that the practical task of organizing and setting up MICAH will require a great deal of care and time. For that reason, the transition period the Council has just adopted by its decision to continue MIPONUH until 15 March 2000 is essential if MICAH is to be organized, deployed and utilized to its full potential.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">MICAH will be a new mission, fundamentally different from a peacekeeping mission, and the choice of the experts who will constitute the mission will be a key element of success. Recruiting them will take time. It will take time also to coordinate the activities of MICAH with those of the many existing multilateral and bilateral programmes in Haiti, such as the Canadian support programme for the police and the justice system. Above all, we must ensure that MICAH will be not a stop-gap measure, but the instrument for consolidating the achievements of United Nations action and for putting in place the elements needed for long-term support for Haiti.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa01">It is the people and the Government of Haiti that bear the ultimate responsibility for reconstruction and for the maintenance of a secure and stable political environment in their country. In that regard, the legislative elections planned for 19 March 2000 will be an important milestone. As they are fundamental to Haiti's democratic development, it is essential that those elections take place as set out in the electoral calendar, and in a secure environment, in order to ensure the political stability to which Haitians aspire.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa02">Finally, our decision to continue MIPONUH in order to build MICAH is based on a desire to support the will of the Haitian people to advance their development. Ensuring a peaceful and smooth transition is also a responsibility of the Security Council, and we sincerely hope that today's decision signals a spirit of cooperation between the Council and the General Assembly in advancing this common cause.</p>
