	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council recalls the statements of its President of 31 August 1998 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1998-26.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1998/26</a>) and 11 December 1998 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1998-36.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1998/36</a>). It reaffirms its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1234(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1234 (1999)</a> of 9 April 1999 on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and calls on all parties to comply with this resolution. It expresses its continued concern at the continuing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to preserving the national unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and all other States in the region. It further reaffirms its support for the regional mediation process facilitated by the President of the Republic of Zambia on behalf of the Southern African Development Community in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and with support from the United Nations to find a peaceful settlement to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council takes note of the constructive efforts being made to promote a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the context of the above-mentioned regional mediation process, including the meeting and agreement signed at Sirte on 18 April 1999. It calls on all parties to demonstrate commitment to the peace process and to participate with a constructive and flexible spirit in the forthcoming summit in Lusaka scheduled for 26 June 1999. In this context, the Council calls on the parties immediately to sign a ceasefire agreement which includes the appropriate modalities and mechanisms for its implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms its readiness to consider the active involvement of the United Nations, in coordination with the OAU, including through concrete sustainable and effective measures, to assist in the implementation of an effective ceasefire agreement and in an agreed process for political settlement of the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council emphasizes the need for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to permit the economic reconstruction of the country, so as to enhance development and foster national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council stresses the need for a continuing process of genuine national reconciliation and democratization in all States of the Great Lakes region. It reaffirms the importance of holding, at the appropriate time, an international conference on security, stability and development for the Great Lakes region and encourages the international community to help facilitate such a conference.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council expresses its appreciation and full support for the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy for the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter."</p>
