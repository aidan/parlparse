<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of 14 permanent judges of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 for a four-year term of office commencing on 17 November 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">At the election of judges in 1997, 11 judges were elected for a term of four years. The terms of office of the judges began on 17 November 1997 and will expire on 16 November 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa03">By its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1166(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1166 (1998)</a> of 13 May 1998, the Security Council decided to establish a third Trial Chamber, and decided that three additional judges were to be elected to serve in that Chamber. Pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1166(1998).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1166 (1998)</a> of 13 May 1998, the General Assembly, on 16 October 1998, elected to the third Trial Chamber of the International Tribunal three additional judges, whose terms of office will also expire on 16 November 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa04">In connection with the election today of the 14 permanent judges, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the General Assembly:</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa05">First, in accordance with article 13 bis, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Tribunal as amended by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1166(1998).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 1166 (1998)</a> of 13 May 1998 and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1329(2000).pdf" class="pdf">1329 (2000)</a> of 30 November 2000, the 14 permanent judges of the International Tribunal shall be elected by the General Assembly from a list of candidates submitted by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa06">At its 4274th meeting, on 8 February 2001, the Security Council, in accordance with article 13 bis, subparagraph 1 (c), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, established in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1340(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1340 (2001)</a> a list of 26 candidates, taking due account of adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the world. The list was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by a letter dated 8 February 2001 from the President of the Security Council. The letter was issued as <a href="../pdf/A-55-771.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/771</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa07">Secondly, in accordance with article 13 bis, subparagraph 1 (d), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, the Holy See and Switzerland, the two non-member States maintaining Permanent Observer Missions at United Nations Headquarters, shall participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. On this occasion, I am happy to welcome here the representatives of the Holy See and Switzerland.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa08">Finally, I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning the election of judges of the International Tribunal is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-769.pdf" class="nolink">document A/55/769</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa09">The list of 25 candidates can be found in paragraph 9 of <a href="../pdf/A-55-769.pdf" class="nolink">document A/55/769</a>. As indicated in the footnote to paragraph 9 of that document, one of the 26 candidates on the list established by the Security Council has decided to withdraw her candidacy for judge of the International Tribunal. There are therefore only 25 candidates for this election.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa10">The curricula vitae of the 25 candidates are contained in <a href="../pdf/A-55-773.pdf" class="pdf">document A/55/773</a> and addendum 1. In that connection, may I bring to Members' attention the provision of article 13 of the Statute of the International Tribunal, which reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa11">"The permanent and ad litem judges shall be persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices. In the overall composition of the Chambers and sections of the Trial Chambers, due account shall be taken of the experience of the judges in criminal law, international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law."</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa12">As representatives are aware, the election of judges will take place in accordance with the relevant provisions of article 13 bis of the Statute of the International Tribunal. In addition, given the similar nature of the election of judges of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the International Tribunal, it was decided at the time of the election of judges in 1993, as well as in 1997 and 1998, to follow similar election procedures in the General Assembly. In his memorandum, the Secretary-General suggests that this precedent be applied to the election of judges of the International Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa13">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to that suggestion?</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg002-bk01">

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">In accordance with article 13 bis, subparagraph 1 (d), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, the candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the two non-member States shall be declared elected.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose, are all the Member States and the two non-member States, namely, the Holy See and Switzerland. Accordingly, 96 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of electing judges of the International Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">If in the first ballot the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than 14, a second ballot will be held and balloting will continue, in the same meeting, until 14 candidates have obtained an absolute majority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">Following the practice in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, the Secretary-General suggests in his memorandum that any second and subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted -- I repeat, that any second and subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">It is further suggested that, following the practice in the election of the judges of the International Court of Justice, if more than 14 candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will be held on all candidates and balloting will continue, at the same meeting, until 14 candidates, and no more, have obtained an absolute majority.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Once again, the delegation of Mexico will not participate in the election of judges of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Mexico is committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and to full compliance with the norms of international humanitarian law. It is for this reason that Mexico, in order to fight impunity and guarantee the rule of law, has always expressed its support for investigating serious crimes against humanity and for bringing to justice and punishing those responsible.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Mexico believes that, in establishing this Tribunal, the Security Council went beyond its powers, given the fact that the Charter of the United Nations contains no explicit provision granting the Council the authority to create jurisdictional mechanisms of this nature. Mexico remains convinced that once the International Criminal Court is operational -- a body whose establishment followed the norms of international law -- the establishment of new special tribunals will not be necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">Nevertheless, Mexico will continue to pay in a timely manner its assessed contribution for the funding of the Tribunal, strictly abiding by the decisions adopted in this regard by the General Assembly.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tarabrin</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">With regard to the General Assembly's consideration of agenda item 166, regarding the election of judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the delegation of the Russian Federation finds it necessary to make the following statement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">The International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (ICTY) was established in 1993 in very specific historical conditions as a temporary measure aimed, in particular, at ensuring the restoration and support of peace in the region. Today, in spite of the very positive changes that have taken place in the Balkans and the acquisition of United Nations membership by all the independent States emerging from the territory of the former Yugoslavia, the General Assembly is being compelled for the third time to elect judges for the ICTY, effectively renewing the Tribunal's mandate for the next four years. This situation cannot be considered to be normal.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">In our opinion, the very protracted functioning of that temporary body is justifiable neither politically nor financially. We must not forget that the main international legal responsibility for the punishment of those guilty of gross violations of international law lies with States. The Tribunal must concentrate on specific crimes that States, for a variety of reasons, are unable independently to pursue. We are convinced that the acceleration of the administration of justice and the speedy conclusion of the Tribunal's activities should be specified as a priority of the Prosecutor's work and that closer links must be established between the Tribunal and the national legal systems of the States of the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa04">We feel that the assignment to national courts of matters being considered by the ICTY and the establishment of a final cut-off of the Tribunal's temporary jurisdiction, on which the Security Council has already spoken in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1329(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1329 (2000)</a>, would improve the Tribunal's effectiveness and eliminate from future General Assembly agendas the item on the election of judges to that body.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa05">We continue to be concerned by serious problems in the activities of the ICTY, in particular those of the Prosecutor. Politicization, anti-Serbian bias and attempts to place collective blame on the entire nation are pervasive in the ICTY. Such practices are in conflict with the mandate accorded the Tribunal by the Security Council on behalf of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa06">There must be serious improvements in the work of the Prosecutor. It is essential that the truth be told to the international community of the tragedy at Racak; that the practice of issuing sealed warrants be abandoned; and that the secret 1996 memorandum between the ICTY and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) -- sanctioning the hunting down of indictees that has often led to the murder and death of suspects, in violation of the borders of sovereign States -- be published. We expect the Prosecutor finally to be able to look into the many cases of murder of peaceful civilians and the destruction of state property as a result of NATO's attacks on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa07">Russia expects the new corps of ICTY judges to act to overcome the bias in the Tribunal's work and to hasten the conclusion of its work. In that understanding, the delegation of the Russian Federation will participate in today's vote.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Archbishop Martino</span> <span class="non-nation">Holy See</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">The Holy See has attentively followed the proceedings of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">As already stated in the past, the Holy See regards the Tribunal as an instrument of the international community to express its condemnation of violations of international humanitarian law. The Holy See appreciates that the United Nations recognizes the Holy See's active role in the international arena. In fact, although the Holy See is a non-Member State that maintains a permanent observer mission at the United Nations, it is invited to participate, in the same manner as the States Members, in the election of permanent judges to the Tribunal, in accordance with the Statute of the International Tribunal, amended by the Security Council in paragraph 1 (d) of article 13 bis of annex I of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1329(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1329 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">On this occasion, the Holy See, in consideration of its specific nature and its objectives, and in accordance with recognized practice in similar cases, has decided to abstain from casting its vote on the individual candidates for the offices of judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. In doing so, the Holy See wishes to reiterate its confidence in the choices that will be made by the international community and expresses its sincere best wishes to the judges who will soon be elected to serve the cause of justice and peace in the world.</p>
