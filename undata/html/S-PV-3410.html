	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">&quot;For the last few months, the Security Council has been following closely the tense and volatile situation in Burundi, based on briefings by the Secretariat. The Council appreciates the efforts made in Burundi to maintain peace in the country under very difficult circumstances and, in this context, commends the civilian and military authorities concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the ongoing cooperation between the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations to assist in maintaining peace in Burundi. In this connection, the Security Council encourages the Secretary-General to continue using his good offices through his Special Representative.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council is deeply concerned by the humanitarian problems created as a result of the arrival of tens of thousands of refugees in the northern Burundi provinces.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council supports the ongoing political dialogue in Burundi aimed at reaching an early agreement on presidential succession. It calls on all parties to reach rapidly a settlement based on democratic principles.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Council condemns those extremist elements who continue to reject the ongoing negotiations and seek to block progress towards a peaceful settlement. In this context, the Council is alarmed by the recent violence in Bujumbura and reiterates the terms of its statements of 25 October 1993 (<a href="../pdf/S-26631.pdf" class="nolink">S/26631</a>) and 16 November 1993 (<a href="../pdf/S-26757.pdf" class="nolink">S/26757</a>). The Council demands that all parties cease immediately any incitement to violence or ethnic hatred.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Council encourages all those who support a peaceful solution to persist in their efforts. It further calls upon all Burundians, especially political, military and religious leaders, to do their utmost for the success of the ongoing political dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Security Council looks forward to reports on Burundi from the Secretary-General and will remain actively seized of the matter.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-38.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/38</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
