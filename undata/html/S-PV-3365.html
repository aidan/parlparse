It commends all the parties involved for the statesmanship and goodwill which they have displayed in reaching this result.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Council expresses the hope that this agreement will bring an end to the violence which has scarred South Africa and that it will promote lasting reconciliation among the people of South Africa. It calls upon all parties to contribute to the conduct of free and fair elections in which all South Africans will be able to participate peacefully.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Council commends the positive contribution by the United Nations Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA) and the international community to the transitional process in South Africa and reiterates its determination to support the process of peaceful democratic change for the benefit of all South Africans. It calls upon all parties to respect the safety and security of the international election observers and to assist them to carry out their mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Council looks forward to the successful completion of the electoral process in South Africa and to the establishment of a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa that will take its place in the international community.&quot;</p>
