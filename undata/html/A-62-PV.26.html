<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01"> The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">The five outgoing non-permanent members are the following: the Congo, Ghana, Peru, Qatar and Slovakia. Those five States cannot be re-elected. Their names, therefore, should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in the year 2008 the following States: Belgium, Indonesia, Italy, Panama and South Africa. The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">Of the five non-permanent members that will remain in office in the year 2008, two are from Africa and Asia, one is from Latin America and the Caribbean and two are from Western Europe and other States.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: three from Africa and Asia, one from Eastern Europe and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the three States to be elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from Africa and one from Asia.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa07">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa08">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg001-bk04">

	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be no nominations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by the Chairpersons of the respective regional groups of the following. For the three vacant seats from among the African and Asian States, there are three endorsed candidates, namely, Burkina Faso, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Viet Nam. For the one vacant seat from among the Eastern European States, there are two candidates, namely, Croatia and the Czech Republic. For the one vacant seat from among the Latin America and Caribbean States, there are two candidates, namely, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">I would also like to seek the usual cooperation of representatives during the time of the conduct of the election. Please be reminded that during the voting process, all campaigning should cease in the General Assembly Hall. That means in particular that once the meeting has begun, no more campaign material can be distributed inside the Hall. All delegates are also requested to remain at their seats so that the voting process can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank members for their cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa06">We shall now begin the voting process. Members are requested to remain seated until all ballots have been collected.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa07">Ballot papers marked "A", "B" and "C" will now be distributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot papers that have been distributed.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa08">May I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers marked "A", for the African and Asian States, the names of the three States for which they wish to vote; on the ballot papers marked "B", for the Eastern European States, the name of the one State for which they wish to vote; and on the ballot papers marked "C", for the Latin American and Caribbean States, the name of the one State for which they wish to vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa09">A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains more names of Member States from the relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if all the names of the Member States on that ballot do not belong to the relevant region. If a ballot paper contains names of Member States that do not belong to that region, the ballot remains valid, but only the names of the Member States that belong to the relevant region will be counted. The names of Member States that do not belong to that region will not be counted at all.</p>

Naturally, my Government wishes to thank all those countries that voted for us in a spirit of brotherhood and, above all, of Latin American and global unity. Now, more than ever before, in the world in which we live, which is threatened by so many difficulties, the Government of President Leonel Fernández is further demonstrating its historic and continental vision of brotherhood among all peoples of Latin America and the rest of the world.</p>
