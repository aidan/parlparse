	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa01">Mr. President, I wish to thank you and the members of your staff for arranging this tribute to The Honourable Roosevelt Douglas, the late Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Commonwealth of Dominica. On behalf of the Douglas family and the Government and people of Dominica, I would also like to use this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to those from whom we have received words of comfort and expressions of sympathy at this moment of sadness for all Dominicans.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa02">Honourable Roosevelt Douglas was born in Portsmouth, Dominica, on 15 October 1941. The second son of a relatively prosperous family, "Rosie", as he was popularly known throughout the Caribbean, demonstrated at an early age a willingness to assist the less fortunate, and that caring and generous spirit shaped his character and outlook.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa03">After completing his secondary education, Honourable Roosevelt Douglas left Dominica in 1961 to pursue studies in agriculture at the University of Guelph in Canada. Upon graduation from Guelph, the young Roosevelt Douglas changed course and courses, proceeding to study political science at McGill University. That he should choose politics over agriculture is not surprising; both his father and his older brother, Michael, had been successful politicians and Members of Parliament before him. But his political journey began in inauspicious circumstances, and he was destined to go down a political path not travelled by either his father or brother.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa04">The late Honourable Roosevelt Douglas was pursuing doctoral studies in political science when the turbulent events of the 1960s and his life experiences in Canada impelled him to take an uncompromising stand against racism and the discrimination and indignity associated with it. As a consequence, his studies came to an end. On his return to Dominica in 1976, he immediately immersed himself in local politics and joined forces with those campaigning for independence from Britain.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa05">The late Roosevelt Douglas was elected to the Dominica Parliament for the first time in 1985. From 1982 until his death, he was the leader of the Labour Party of Dominica, and from 1996 to 1999 he served as Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. On 4 February 2000 Honourable Roosevelt Douglas was sworn in as the fifth Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Dominica.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa06">Throughout his adult life Roosevelt Douglas had a singular passionate commitment to the struggle for the liberation of black people everywhere and for the economic and political empowerment of the poor and disadvantaged. Driven by that commitment and his concern for social and economic justice, he became involved in the 1980s and 1990s in international solidarity work in various parts of the world. In southern Africa, in particular, he played an important role in support of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and the African National Congress (ANC) in the struggle against apartheid. During that period he also established significant relationships with other Labour Parties and Governments in Europe. In the course of his brief stewardship as Prime Minister of Dominica, he promoted those relationships as building blocks of a new cooperative effort to develop relationships with Europe.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa07">Never a politician in the conventional mould, the late Prime Minister energized the political debate in his own country and in the Caribbean by frequently expressing views and advocating positions considered politically unwise by some. In his quest for dignity, respect and better economic conditions for the less privileged, the Prime Minister would not allow himself to be distracted by criticism at home or abroad.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa08">Not everyone shared his vision of a humane and just society and the mechanisms for achieving that goal. But, if the late Prime Minister were to speak to this Assembly today, I think he would feel very comfortable with the following quotation from George Bernard Shaw:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg001-bk06-pa09">"You see things; and you say, `Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say, `Why not?'"</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa10">The legacy of Roosevelt Bernard Douglas is that he dared to ask "why not", and in so doing touched in a fundamental way the lives of many people in Dominica, the Caribbean and elsewhere.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa11">Honourable Roosevelt Douglas passed on suddenly and untimely on Sunday, 1 October 2000 at his residence in Portsmouth, Dominica. The Commonwealth of Dominica has lost one of its illustrious sons, a consistent fighter for freedom and social and economic justice, a man whose vision, engaging personality, sense of humour and ability to communicate with people at all levels made him one of the Caribbean's leading political figures.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk06-pa12">While the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica mourn his loss, we are thankful for the 58 years he spent among us.</div>
