	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Pursuant to the decisions taken at the 5289th meeting, held earlier today, I recognize the presence at the table of the representative of Serbia and Montenegro pursuant to rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure, as well as that of Mr. Søren Jessen-Petersen, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, and Mr. Kai Eide, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the comprehensive review of the situation in Kosovo, pursuant to rule 39.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the report prepared by the United Nations Secretary-General's standards review Envoy, Ambassador Kai Eide, on the comprehensive review of the implementation of Standards, as well as of the overall situation in and relating to Kosovo (Serbia and Montenegro), forwarded by the Secretary-General on 7 October 2005 (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-635.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/635</a>). The Council pays tribute to Ambassador Eide's work in compiling his important report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council recalls the Secretary-General's report of 23 May 2005 (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-335.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/335</a>) in which he initiated the comprehensive review conducted by Ambassador Eide. In the light of the findings in Ambassador Eide's report, the Council stresses that further, more sustained progress is required, and that the implementation of standards in Kosovo must continue with undiminished energy and a stronger sense of commitment, as underlined by the Secretary-General in his letter. It urges Kosovo's leaders to increase their efforts to ensure the implementation of standards at all levels, allowing tangible results to be delivered to all Kosovo's citizens. Particular and time-conscious attention should be given to protecting minorities, developing further the process of decentralization, creating the necessary conditions to allow sustainable returns, preservation of cultural and religious heritage in Kosovo, and promoting reconciliation. The Council also urges the authorities in Belgrade to do their utmost to facilitate this process, and to engage constructively. The Council reaffirms its full support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Søren Jessen-Petersen, and UNMIK in their continuing work to support the implementation of standards, which must continue during the future status process and will be an important factor in determining the degree of progress.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council agrees with Ambassador Eide's overall assessment that, notwithstanding the challenges still facing Kosovo and the wider region, the time has come to move to the next phase of the political process. The Council therefore supports the United Nations Secretary-General's intention to start a political process to determine Kosovo's future status, as foreseen in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The Council reaffirms the framework of the resolution, and welcomes the Secretary-General's readiness to appoint a Special Envoy to lead the future status process. It looks forward to an early appointment. The Council offers its full support to this political process, which would determine Kosovo's future status, and further reaffirms its commitment to the objective of a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo, which must reinforce regional stability.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the intention of the Contact Group (France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) to remain closely engaged in the political process that will be led by the United Nations, and to support the Secretary-General's Future Status</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa08">Envoy. The Council calls upon interested regional and international organizations to cooperate closely in the process to determine Kosovo's future status. The Council also supports the meaningful involvement and cooperation of countries in the region.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council requests that the Secretary-General provide regular updates on progress in determining Kosovo's future status, as defined by Security Council resolution 1244</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa10">(1999), and will remain actively seized of the matter."</blockquote>
