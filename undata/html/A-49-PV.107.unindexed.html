<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa01">The Assembly will first consider draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-49-L.68.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.68</a>), entitled "Strengthening of the United Nations system", which I have the honour to introduce.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa02">The consensus text before the General Assembly this morning is the result of intensive consultations held on my behalf by His Excellency Mr. Sreenivasan of India. I wish to reiterate my special gratitude to him and to express my satisfaction at the spirit of cooperation that prevailed during the consultations. I believe this text reflects the importance accorded by Member States to the need to enhance the role of the United Nations in these challenging times. Before we proceed to consider the draft resolution, I should like to recall some important understandings that must be taken into account in the implementation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa03">By operative paragraph 1, the Assembly would decide to establish the Open-ended High-level Working Group, under the chairmanship of the President of the General Assembly and with two vice-chairmen to be elected by the Working Group. During the discussions, it was agreed that the Working Group would hold a meeting during the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. By the terms of the same paragraph, the Assembly would decide that the Working Group may establish sub-groups open to the participation of all Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa04">With regard to operative paragraph 2, which describes the type of reports and studies that should be reviewed by the Working Group, there was agreement that, given the complexity and exceedingly high volume of documentation available, work to systematically gather information would have to begin as soon as possible. Thus it would be necessary for the Working Group or, as appropriate, its Bureau, to meet for organizational purposes during the period September to December. It would be specially important for the Working Group or, as appropriate, its Bureau, to provide guidance to the Secretariat before it began the task of preparing material for the Working Group. The studies and reports of commissions and institutions, some of which have made far-reaching proposals, encompass many aspects of the United Nations system in the political, economic, social and other fields. Synthesizing and classifying all these studies and reports will be a significant undertaking. It is therefore necessary to channel efforts so that the material presented responds to a work plan. As stated in operative paragraph 4, the Working Group would commence its substantive work during the fiftieth session. However, it is important to note that the bulk of the substantive work would begin in 1996, thus giving the Secretariat some time to carry out initial research and gather information to be placed before the Working Group at the earliest opportunity in 1996.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa05">The request contained in operative paragraph 3 that the Working Group maintain regular contacts with the bureaux of the working groups mentioned in the fifth preambular paragraph is essential to avoid duplication, and is designed to ensure that the work of the other working groups can continue unimpeded. A transparent mechanism would be devised to facilitate those contacts. The Working Group should submit a report on its work before the conclusion of the fiftieth session. It would thus have to organize its work and calendar of meetings so that it can prepare and submit a report in due time, and no later than Monday, 16 September 1996, the date when the fiftieth session will come to a close.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa06">The draft resolution, in operative paragraph 5, requests the Secretary-General to provide, within existing resources, to be supplemented by a trust fund to which voluntary contributions could be solicited, full assistance to the Working Group, including the facilities and support services necessary for it to conduct its work. The trust fund would be used for securing the services of experts to review and analyse the existing related work, and Member States are urged to contribute to this fund.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa07">The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.68.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.68</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa08">The report of the Fifth Committee on the programme budget implications of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.68.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.68</a> is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-49-961.pdf" class="pdf">document A/49/961</a>.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Birenbaum</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">The United States was pleased to join the consensus on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.68.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.68</a>, entitled "Strengthening of the United Nations system".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">Our delegation thanks you, Mr. President, for your vision leading to today's consensus resolution. We also wish to express our gratitude to Ambassador Sreenivasan of India for his inspired leadership in bringing the work of the drafting committee to a successful conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">Your initiative, Mr. President, has encouraged Member States to think beyond today's issues, to contemplate a United Nations system organized to address the challenges of the future with far greater effectiveness and efficiency and a clearer focus on its essential missions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">As President Clinton said last June at the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, "The United Nations must become more flexible, operate more rapidly, waste less and produce more and, most importantly, inspire confidence among our Governments and peoples."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">Today's consensus provides a vehicle for Member States to develop a blueprint for such a United Nations system. The Working Group will not have to start from scratch. Fortunately, it will be able to draw upon a rich body of literature on reforming the United Nations, as well as submissions by Member States. The job of the Working Group will be to harvest the best of these ideas and incorporate them into its report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. In so doing, the Working Group should avoid duplicating the work of other working groups. The resolution so stipulates, and the United States is fully committed to focusing the efforts of this new Working Group on matters which are not being addressed by such bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa06">This fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is the best possible occasion for us to undertake this work. What greater gift could we bestow upon our successors than a revitalized, strengthened and reformed United Nations system? The United States looks forward to working with all Member States in the spirit of partnership to assure that the high promise of this resolution is realized.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa07">As President Clinton emphatically affirmed in his San Francisco address, the United States is fully committed to the United Nations system. We want to do everything in our power to help it fulfil the timeless purposes and principles of the Charter. It is in that spirit that we dedicate ourselves to joining with all delegations in working constructively to produce a blueprint for the United Nations of the twenty-first century by the end of the historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I now call on the representative of Spain, who will make a statement on behalf of the European Union.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yañez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The Republic of Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, Malta, the Republic of Poland, Romania and the Slovak Republic align themselves with the content of this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">The General Assembly has just adopted without a vote draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.68.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.68</a>, which you, Mr. President, submitted with a view to consideration of the question of the strengthening of the United Nations system. The European Union wishes to express its satisfaction at this decision, which represents the successful outcome of the initiative undertaken by you, and to convey to you its appreciation for the tireless efforts that you have devoted to this issue in the past few months.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">Let me also convey through you to the delegation of India the warmest appreciation of the European Union for the skilful way in which Ambassador Sreenivasan chaired the "informal informals" which successfully resulted in the text which we have adopted today.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The European Union, which attaches great importance to efforts aimed at the revitalization, strengthening and reform of the United Nations system, follows with particular attention the initiatives directed towards the achievement of this goal. In this perspective, the European Council, in the solemn Declaration adopted at its meeting held in Cannes on 26 and 27 June, called upon the United Nations and its Member States</p>
	<blockquote id="pg003-bk02-pa06">"to pursue and develop the reform programme under way, in order to remedy the weaknesses in some areas and to be ready to take up the challenges of the next century".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">This call forcefully embodies the rationale of the constructive and active approach taken by the European Union, as well as by its Member States, in the work of the various working groups of the General Assembly already established and of our positive consideration of the reforms undertaken by the Secretariat. It will also guide the active participation of the European Union in the wide-ranging debate on the future of the Organization, for which the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will be a welcome occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">With the adoption of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.68.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.68</a>, the Open-ended High-level Working Group which we have decided to establish becomes an integral element of the network of working groups that at present are considering the most appropriate ways to prepare our Organization for the challenges which lie ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">As is rightly pointed out in operative paragraph 2 of the resolution, the Working Group will specify by consensus those ideas and proposals, drawn from the thorough review of different studies and reports, that it concludes are appropriate for the purpose of revitalization, strengthening and reform of the United Nations system in fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">This work of collation and identification will help reinforce and complement reform efforts under way in other working groups of the General Assembly without in any way duplicating or impeding that work. I refer, of course, to the Working Groups listed in the fifth preambular paragraph of the resolution: the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on An Agenda for Development, the High-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations, the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council, the Informal Open-ended Working Group on An Agenda for Peace and the Consultations on Prospective New Modalities for Financing Operational Activities for Development.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">In this respect, I wish to underline the particular importance that the European Union attaches to the careful implementation of this fundamental feature of the new Working Group's mandate. To this end, it is essential that there be close cooperation between the Bureaus of all these Working Groups.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">Moreover, the European Union wishes to reiterate that it considers particularly relevant for the work of the High-level Working Group awareness of the importance of a viable financial basis for the success and proper functioning of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">The European Union listened attentively, Mr. President, to your statement introducing draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.68.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.68</a>, and wishes to express its agreement with the understandings that must be taken into account in the implementation of the resolution just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa14">The European Union wishes to pledge its constructive participation in the substantive work of the Working Group to begin during the fiftieth session of the General Assembly, and expresses its hope that Member States will engage in this exercise with a view to strengthening the United Nations system and with a firm commitment to supporting it in its action. To that end, the European Union looks forward to the early election by the Working Group of its Bureau.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I call on the representative of the Philippines, who will make a statement on behalf of the Group of 77.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mabilangan</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the Joint Coordinating Committee of the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, I wish to convey our pleasure at seeing you, Sir, preside over the General Assembly and also warmly to congratulate you on your successful initiative to establish a Working Group to address the issue of strengthening the United Nations system. We also congratulate you on guiding us towards a consensus on this subject. I also wish to extend, on behalf of the Joint Coordinating Committee, congratulations and particular appreciation to Ambassador Sreenivasan of India for his patient but firm guidance of the negotiations on the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The resolution we have adopted is also the result of constructive negotiations and cooperation on the part of all groups and delegations. All sides exercised flexibility and made the necessary compromises in order to reach consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">The Joint Coordinating Committee of the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement views the resolution, and hence the Working Group we have established, as an important vehicle for considering and identifying by consensus various proposals aimed at strengthening the United Nations system. We also attach importance to the fact that this Working Group shall be at a high level and open-ended -- in other words, open to the participation of all Member States. This, in our view, is an essential prerequisite for achieving a real consensus on the output of the Working Group.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">We further recognize and fully support the agreement that the Working Group shall not duplicate the work of the other Working Groups, nor should a new Working Group impede the efforts of the other Working Groups in fulfilling their respective mandates. This particular agreement, in operative paragraph 2, is the only way to ensure a successful and meaningful implementation of the mandate of the Working Group. Maintaining regular contacts with the bureaux of the other Working Groups, as called for in the resolution, would help in ensuring that duplication of work is avoided.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">The Joint Coordinating Committee is prepared to begin substantive work at a suitable time during the fiftieth session. In this regard, full account should be taken of the heavy work schedule of the General Assembly, particularly at the fiftieth session, and of the constraints faced by smaller delegations. Above all, and given the open-ended nature of the Working Group, we must ensure the fullest participation of all delegations in its deliberations. The Joint Coordinating Committee of the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement is particularly keen on ensuring that this basic concern be observed in determining the schedule of meetings of the Group. Given the importance of the task entrusted to the Working Group, universal participation is essential to its success. We also note your observation, Mr. President, that the bulk of the substantive work would begin in 1996.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Finally, we intend to continue working constructively with all other groups and delegations and to participate actively in the Working Group. It is truly our hope that this new Working Group will play a major part in strengthening the United Nations system so that the United Nations can play an effective role in meeting the global challenges of the twenty-first century.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Balzan</span> <span class="nation">Malta</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like to associate itself with the statement made earlier by the Permanent Representative of Spain on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">It is with satisfaction that we welcome the adoption of the resolution, without a vote, on the question of the strengthening of the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">We would particularly like to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for your tireless efforts to ensure the successful outcome of your initiative. Our expressions of gratitude are also directed at Ambassador Sreenivasan, who displayed all his diplomatic skills in steering the "informal informals" to a successful conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Ever since it joined the Organization, Malta has been at the forefront in highlighting the need to reform the organization and institutional structures of the United Nations in order to better face the realities and challenges of the day.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">It is deeply satisfying to this delegation to witness your continued interest, Mr. President, in pursuing the initiatives taken by your predecessors in their efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization. The input contributed by past Presidents towards the consolidation and reform process warrants our acknowledgement. It was during the forty-fifth session that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malta, Mr. Guido de Marco, then President of the General Assembly, launched a number of proposals aimed at the reform of the various institutions within the United Nations system -- and this at a time when the international community was experiencing a momentous phase of transition.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">Following up on the initiatives taken by Mr. de Marco, the Government of Malta earlier this year submitted a request for the inclusion of an item on the provisional agenda of the fiftieth session on the review of the role of the Trusteeship Council.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">My delegation sincerely hopes, Sir, that your successors will continue to develop the ongoing process of reform initiated by your predecessors, a process that you have successfully pursued.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Biørn Lian</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">Let me first say that we are all deeply indebted to you, Mr. President, for the determination you have shown to ensure the adoption of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.68.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.68</a> on the strengthening of the United Nations system, and we are also sincerely grateful for the efficient manner in which Ambassador Sreenivasan of the Mission of India guided the consultations that produced the present text.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Norway wholeheartedly supports all efforts to strengthen the United Nations system and to strengthen its role, capacity, effectiveness and efficiency. We believe that the establishment of the Open-ended High-level Working Group should become a vehicle for the kind of reform and revitalization of the Organization that is needed if its full potential is to be realized and if the Organization is to be able to respond more fully to the needs and aspirations of the peoples of the world and of future generations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">The timing could not be better. The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is the right occasion to take stock of the lessons learned during the first 50 years, lessons acquired against the background of wars, cold and hot; efforts at development and the eradication of poverty; and the aspirations of peoples to self-determination and decolonization; and we should look ahead. Proposals for reform should, in our view, come to fruition before the end of the fiftieth session. That would be an important signal to the outside world that we, Members of the United Nations, give this work the necessary attention and priority.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">The Nordic countries have a long tradition of promoting equitable and forward-looking reform in the United Nations system. The urgency of the issue was again pointed out by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five Nordic countries on 31 August. They stressed, among other things, the importance of arriving at concrete results in the various Working Groups that deal with reform, and they reiterated their strong support for the United Nations and for global multinational cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">We would like to stress the need for the work of the High-level Working Group to be future-oriented and truly visionary. Its work should be broader based and also take account of the debate, the ideas and the proposals generated outside Government circles and the United Nations, such as the report on global governance, the Carlsson-Ramphal report. We therefore share the view of the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization, where he refers to the recent reports of a number of independent Commissions on the United Nations in its next 50 years as being of particular relevance for the work of the High-level Working Group.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">We look forward to the start of the work of the Working Group and pledge our full and active support.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">I think this resolution is the result of everything that was said in plenary by all delegations, and especially by the Heads of delegations. All of them called for reform of the United Nations on the eve of the twenty-first century.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa02">The European Union, as it has already stated on previous occasions, particularly in the High-level Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations, attaches the greatest political importance to the need to find a solution to the Organization's financial crisis in order to establish a solid, permanent financial base for the Organization, thus enabling the United Nations to carry out all the mandates entrusted to it.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa03">In this respect, I wish to recall that at its meeting held in Cannes last 26 and 27 June the European Council adopted a solemn declaration on the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations in which it stressed that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg006-bk07-pa04">"the success and proper functioning of the United Nations depend above all on the political support of its Member States and on the resources they put at its disposal, notably by full, punctual and unconditional fulfilment of their financial obligations".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa05">We have just adopted without a vote the draft decision recommended by the High-level Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations, by which note is taken of the Working Group's work and it is decided that the Group should continue its work during the coming session of the General Assembly.While taking a positive view of this decision, the European Union wishes to underline the increasingly imperative need to adopt a comprehensive package of measures to improve the financial situation of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa06">In this regard, the European Union wishes to express its concern over the Working Group's inability so far to recommend any concrete measures, despite the time and efforts devoted to consideration of the issue. As the Secretary-General told the Working Group last 22 June, and as he recently reiterated in his report (<a href="../pdf/A-50-1.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/1</a>) on the work of the Organization, concrete measures must be adopted, possibly including some of those that have already been proposed. At any rate, it is necessary to take decisions to prevent the financial situation from continuing to deteriorate day by day.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa07">The European Union has noted with great concern the statement made in the Fifth Committee on 12 September 1995 by the Under-Secretary-General for the Department of Administration and Management, Mr. Connor, in which he stressed the continual grave deterioration of the financial situation of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa08">We recognize that this situation requires urgent measures by the Secretariat, but we wish to reiterate our view that the suspension of reimbursements owed to troop-contributing States should not be regarded as anything but a short-term measure, in view of the heavy and unfair financial burden it places on those countries, particularly those that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Organization. We hope that other measures will be proposed in a proper attempt to resolve the current situation and that proposals for such measures will be submitted to the General Assembly, in accordance with what Mr. Connor said in his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa09">The European Union, which has been very active in the work of the High-level Working Group and has presented various proposals regarding all the elements of the Group's programme of work, including some detailed proposals for a possible revision of the scales of assessment and the establishment of incentives and disincentives, wishes to reiterate its full readiness to collaborate constructively with all Member States to achieve concrete results.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa10">In addition, the member States of the European Union, which in 1995 are contributing 34.4 per cent of the Organization's ordinary budget and 36.7 per cent of the peace-keeping budget, and which in the first half of this year -- through 30 June 1995 -- had paid more than 50 per cent of the total contributions actually collected for both budgets, would like to recall that, as an indispensable condition for resolving the financial crisis of the United Nations, all Member States must clearly demonstrate their willingness to fulfil wholly, punctually and unconditionally their financial obligations under the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa11">For this reason, the European Union considers that any decision that interferes with the fulfilment of these obligations would without any doubt aggravate the current serious financial situation and would also hinder the Organization's capacity to carry out the programmes entrusted to it and to manage them effectively. In this regard, the European Union would like to point out that the unilateral decision taken by the main contributor to limit its contribution to the peace-keeping budget to 25 per cent is unacceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa12">The European Union also wishes to express its appreciation to the Vice-Chairpersons of the High-level Working Group for the excellent manner in which they are conducting its deliberations, as well as to the Secretariat for the ample and interesting documentation provided, which will facilitate the work of the Group in the coming months. In this respect, the European Union would like to receive from the Secretariat consolidated periodical information on all aspects of the cash flow situation of the Organization and, based on the existing data, information on the amounts owed to each Member State.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk07-pa13">Finally, the European Union wishes to reiterate once more the readiness of its member States to continue participating constructively in the High-level Working Group, as soon as it resumes its work. The High-level Working Group should meet as early as possible during the forthcoming regular session of the General Assembly in order to establish the basis for finalizing its work during the fiftieth session.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mabilangan</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of 77 and China on the report of the High-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">At the outset, the Group of 77 and China wish to express their appreciation to you, Mr. President, for your valuable efforts, which led to the adoption by consensus of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-143.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/143</a> on the establishment of this Working Group, and for your wisdom and distinguished leadership which guided its deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The Group of 77 and China also wish to pay special tribute to the two Vice-Chairmen, Ambassador Ernst Sucharipa of Austria and Ambassador Annette des Iles of Trinidad and Tobago, for their commendable efforts and the manner in which they steered the work of the Working Group, and for their determination to adopt the report by consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The Group of 77 and China also wish to acknowledge with sincere appreciation the valuable technical assistance provided by the Secretariat to this Working Group.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The current serious financial situation of the Organization is a concern shared by all Member States. In this context, the Group of 77 and China have actively participated in the deliberations of the Working Group as an indication of their desire to find urgent and viable solutions to the cash-flow problem which has continuously beset the Organization and has threatened its capability to fulfil the mandates entrusted to it by us, the Member States, as well as to meet its own financial obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The Group of 77 and China express the hope that the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will be seized by Member States so that all outstanding contributions and arrears will be paid promptly, mainly by the major contributors, as a reaffirmation of Member States' determination to strengthen the Organization in its role.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">The report before us reflects the varying degrees of difference in the opinions expressed by Member States on the various issues and proposals presented by some Member States and the Secretariat. For their part, the Group of 77 and China have already outlined their views on the approach to be taken in addressing these issues. I would therefore not take the time of the Assembly in reiterating the position of the Group of 77 and China on these issues. However, it is the feeling of the Group of 77 and China that this Working Group still has a long and arduous way to go in the search for a viable solution to the serious financial problems of the United Nations, which we Member States have collectively recognized in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 41/213</a>. In this regard, we joined the consensus decision which the Assembly has just adopted for the Working Group to continue its work at the next session.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">The Group of 77 and China continue to attach great significance and importance to this item on the financial situation of the United Nations. It is therefore the hope of our Group that the timing of the calendar of meetings of the Working Group will afford all Member States the opportunity to participate in the work of the Working Group, bearing in mind the activities that will take place during the regular session. In this regard, the Group of 77 and China would prefer the Working Group to resume its substantive work early next year.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, the Group of 77 and China will continue to participate in the work of this Working Group in a positive and constructive manner.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Biørn Lian</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I should like briefly to associate my delegation with the remarks made a moment ago by the representative of Spain, speaking on behalf of the European Union and, in particular, the concern voiced at the further serious deterioration of the financial situation of the United Nations and at the unilateral decision of one major Member to limit its contribution to the peace-keeping budget to 25 per cent.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">The suspension of reimbursement and payment for Letters of Assist to troop contributors announced by Under-Secretary-General Connor in the Fifth Committee will unfairly affect those countries that are good payers of contributions to the United Nations. We trust that Member countries will be given an opportunity to discuss the economy measures being put in place.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">My delegation wishes to associate itself with the statement made by the Chairman of the Group of 77 on the overall financial situation of the Organization. However, my delegation would wish to refer to the statement by Under-Secretary-General Connor regarding further deterioration of the financial situation of the Organization and the consequent decision to suspend reimbursement to the troop-contributing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">Pakistan has been among the countries which have paid their assessed contribution to the Organization in full and on time. My delegation feels that the decision to suspend reimbursement is likely to create hardships for troop-contributing countries. My delegation would therefore sincerely hope that ways and means will quickly be found to lift this, hopefully, temporary embargo on the reimbursement to troop-contributing countries.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zulkifli</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa01">My delegation would like to associate itself with the statement made by the Ambassador of the Philippines on behalf of the Group of 77 and China on this item. May I also take this opportunity to join in support of the statements made by previous speakers on the issue of the suspension of reimbursement to Member States, especially troop-contributing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa02">Having heard the statement of the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Joseph Connor, on 12 September 1995 before the Fifth Committee, as well as that of the Secretary-General himself a couple of months back in the High-level Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations, my delegation would like to express its regret that, in the light of the serious financial situation, the United Nations Secretariat has to resort to withholding payment to troop-contributing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa03">Malaysia is currently among the largest troop-contributing countries participating in the various peace-keeping missions, with some 1,500 troops abroad. It is to be regretted that countries like Malaysia, which is also one of the countries that have paid their assessments to both the regular and the peace-keeping budgets in full and on time, are in effect being penalized for no wrong-doing of their own. This could have an effect on the participation of other troop-contributing countries in future peace-keeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa04">On several occasions, my delegation has called on the Members of the United Nations, especially the major contributors, to fulfil their Charter obligations and make their mandatory payments to the United Nations in full, on time and without conditions. It is sad that, on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, Member States are in fact not fully committed to and supportive of the work and functioning of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa05">I should like once again to call on Member States to meet their financial obligations so that the United Nations can function properly. I hope that the troop-contributing countries will be spared such a penalty as I have described. Every effort should be made to ensure that Member States, especially the major contributors, urgently respond and fulfil their Charter obligations. My delegation would like to see the United Nations function on a sound and secure footing at the coming fiftieth session of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mabilangan</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa01">Speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I am very pleased to note the confirmation just made by the General Assembly of the appointment of Mr. Rubens Ricupero of Brazil as the new Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa02">I am sure that the international community welcomes the appointment of Mr. Ricupero. We in the Group of 77 should also like to pay a special tribute to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for ending more than a year and a half of anxious waiting for the new Secretary-General of UNCTAD. We wish to express the hope that the Secretary-General of the United Nations will provide Mr. Ricupero with full support in order to enable him to carry out his task. Mr. Ricupero brings to UNCTAD his vast managerial and diplomatic experience. We are confident that under his stewardship UNCTAD will attain new heights.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa03">The developing countries attach particular importance to the work of UNCTAD as a development-oriented body in the United Nations system. UNCTAD has played a central role in providing the General Assembly with the substantive inputs needed to undertake analytical and policy-oriented work in the economic and development fields.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa04">The developing countries are ever more convinced that UNCTAD must be strengthened so that it can exercise fully its development mandate, particularly in the light of the globalization of the international economy and the deepening of economic interdependence among States. UNCTAD has further acquired greater relevance as a result of the creation of the World Trade Organization, which has reinforced the need for a policy-oriented trade forum or institution with a strong development perspective.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa05">Next year delegations of countries will travel to South Africa for the Ninth UNCTAD Conference. UNCTAD IX should usher in an invigorated UNCTAD as a forum for providing important inputs and directions for development. The appointment of Mr. Rubens Ricupero as the new Secretary-General of UNCTAD definitely augurs well for the success of that very important gathering of Member countries.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa02">The Secretary-General of the United Nations has done a most commendable job by nominating Mr. Ricupero, and we thank him for this. This is a clear demonstration of the strong belief of the international community that UNCTAD continues to play an important role in the field of trade and development. We fully subscribe to the statement made by the Chairman of the Group of 77. We are confident that, with his knowledge of the United Nations system and interest in both development and international trade, Mr. Ricupero will lead the organization in an efficient and professional manner in the coming years.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa03">Mr. Ricupero's appointment also augurs well for the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Mid-term Global Review on the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s, scheduled to be held in New York from 26 September. We believe that under his able and inspiring leadership UNCTAD will play a crucial role with renewed vigour in the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s and particularly for the remainder of the decade. The least developed countries pledge their unreserved support to him in the discharge of his new responsibility.</p>

	<p id="pg011-bk03-pa01">I should like also to express my appreciation and that of my Government to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for appointing Ambassador Rubens Ricupero to the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, our cherished and valued UNCTAD. I wish also to convey our gratitude to the Member States for the confirmation of his appointment by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk03-pa02">Let me also convey my gratitude for the warm words of welcome expressed by Ambassador Mabilangan of the Philippines on behalf of the Group of 77. I also extend my thanks to the Permanent Representative of Bangladesh for his stimulating words.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk03-pa03">Ambassador Ricupero has a history of outstanding service to the Brazilian Government and to the international community as a public civil servant, a scholar, a statesman and, above all, a humanist devoted to the causes of development and international cooperation. Ambassador Ricupero won the undisputed respect of his colleagues as a Permanent Representative in Geneva and as President of the Contracting Parties during a particularly difficult period in the Uruguay Round. As his successor in Geneva, I had the privilege of witnessing the recognition of his professional competence and human qualities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk03-pa04">Ambassador Ricupero has also won wide respect for the important roles he later played in public life, such as Brazilian Ambassador to Washington and Minister in charge of the environment. As Minister of Finance at the crucial time of the implementation of the "Real" plan, he played a major role in the stabilization of the Brazilian economy and helped decisively in the negotiations that led to the consolidation of the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR).</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk03-pa05">Ambassador Ricupero rises to the position of Secretary-General of UNCTAD at a particularly relevant moment, when the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. He will certainly be able to make an important contribution to the efforts currently under way to further promote the role of the United Nations in the central issues of the world economy. The implementation of the Uruguay Round and the establishment of the World Trade Organization are a historic breakthrough in the international economy. I am certain that UNCTAD, with our renewed support, will continue to play an outstanding role in the post-Uruguay-Round era.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk03-pa06">As Permanent Representative of Brazil to the United Nations, I wish to stress once more how honoured my country feels at seeing one of its most distinguished citizens being given such an important and challenging responsibility.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Albin</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">May I at the outset inform the Assembly that in addition to the six countries listed, the following have also become co-sponsors of the draft resolution: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Portugal, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">I have the honour to introduce, on behalf of its sponsors, the draft resolution circulated in <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.69.pdf" class="pdf">document A/49/L.69</a>, entitled "United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala".</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">The report submitted by the Secretary-General last 11 August, circulated as <a href="../pdf/A-49-955.pdf" class="pdf">document A/49/955</a>, indicates that the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) continued to fulfil the verification mandate entrusted to it in the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and to contribute to the strengthening of the national institutions and bodies charged with the protection of human rights in Guatemala. In his report the Secretary-General also mentions the importance of the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the parties' request that the Mission verify the human rights aspects of that Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The report of the Director of the Mission, submitted by the Secretary-General for the attention of the General Assembly and circulated in <a href="../pdf/A-49-929.pdf" class="pdf">document A/49/929</a>, describes both the framework within which the Mission carried out its activities and the work it performed. It includes summaries of several of the cases examined and the conclusions and recommendations relating to the implementation of the commitments envisaged in the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights. Among other positive elements pointed out by the Director of MINUGUA, we find the cooperation of the parties and their support for the work of the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">All this makes it clear that MINUGUA is an effective instrument of the international community's support for the efforts of Guatemalans to reach a definitive peace in their country. We, the sponsors, are convinced that MINUGUA's presence in Guatemala is important and should continue. The draft resolution we are introducing to the General Assembly today extends the mandate of the Mission for an additional period of six months, on the basis of the Secretary-General's recommendation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">The draft resolution welcomes the signing of the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, highlighting its importance in the peace process in Guatemala and pointing out that it is also a decisive event in the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People. It also takes note of the parties' request for MINUGUA to verify immediately the human rights aspects of that Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">It also welcomes the Secretary-General's report on MINUGUA, takes note of the second report of the Director of the Mission and calls on the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) to implement the recommendations of the first and second reports of the Director of the Mission and to comply fully with their commitments under the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and with the human rights aspects of the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">The draft resolution also highlights the importance of mobilizing national and international resources to strengthen the Guatemalan system for the protection of human rights and welcomes the donor community's support for the implementation of the agreements reached in the peace process in Guatemala, as well as the efforts of international and regional financial institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">It reiterates the importance of the commitment of the parties, undertaken in the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights, to provide the Mission with their utmost support and all the cooperation needed for it to carry out its functions, particularly with respect to the security of the members of the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">It also calls on the parties to arrive at an agreement on the item entitled "Socio-economic aspects and agrarian situation", which is at present under discussion in the negotiating process, and to continue their efforts to conclude as soon as possible an agreement on a firm and lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa11">Finally, the draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to keep the General Assembly fully informed on the fulfilment of the provisions of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa12">As I said before, we, the sponsors, are convinced that by extending the mandate of the Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala, the international community will be making a contribution to the efforts of the Guatemalan people for reconciliation. It also constitutes a great element of support for the dialogue and negotiations between the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca, and its goal is for them to reach a definitive peace agreement in the shortest possible time.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa13">By virtue of all this, we trust that this draft resolution, which is a manifestation of the effort to which the international community has committed itself with regard to the peace process in Guatemala, will be adopted unanimously by the General Assembly.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">The European Union notes with satisfaction that, since the General Assembly created the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) a year ago, it has been undergoing a process of consolidation, thus becoming a solid and efficient instrument for the verification of human rights in support of the peace process in that Central American country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-236.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/236</a> last 31 March, by which MINUGUA's mandate was extended for six months, we have received the second report of the Director of the Mission, Mr. Leonardo Franco, dated 29 June. The conclusions and recommendations of the report deserve our attention.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">On the one hand, among the positive factors, it is worth highlighting, in particular, the parties' cooperation with and support for the Mission's work, the widespread exercise of freedom of expression, the willingness of the highest Guatemalan authorities to promote the investigation and solving of crimes and the fact that the Government has not encouraged the organization of new Voluntary Civil Defence Committees.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">On the other hand, among the worrisome aspects, it should be pointed out that most of the complaints submitted to the Mission have to do with violations of the right to life, the right of persons to integrity and security and the right to liberty. This proves that the greatest obstacle to the exercise of human rights in Guatemala continues to be impunity, and it underscores the responsibility of the various branches of Government to combat it.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">We have also taken note of the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/A-49-955.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/955</a>) of 11 August 1995 on MINUGUA, which contains the Director of the Mission's assessment of the resources required for the verification of the human rights aspects of the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other activities of the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">The European Union reminds both parties of the terms of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-236.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/236</a> and urges them to renew their effort to comply fully with the commitments they undertook under the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and, in particular, to implement the recommendations contained in MINUGUA's reports. It underlines the responsibility of all sectors of society to cooperate in the eradication of the culture of violence and intolerance.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">The European Union welcomes the fact that the parties have recently shown their willingness to reach the early conclusion of an agreement on a firm and lasting peace. The Contadora Declaration, signed by all the parties in the Guatemala peace process on 22 August 1995, is an encouraging message for the international community. It underlines the firm commitment to the peace process and the importance the parties attach to the next electoral process in the country taking place in the best possible conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">The commitments made in the Contadora Declaration, the importance of which has been underlined by the European Union in the statement made by the Presidency of the Union on 12 September last, as well as the announcement by the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union (URNG) that it will observe a cease-fire during the electoral period from 1 to 13 November, will contribute to the creation of an appropriate climate for the people of Guatemala to go to the polls on 12 November next, freely and without intimidation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">Full respect for the human rights of the population will also enable the participation of the whole of the people of Guatemala and the peaceful conduct of the elections. In the rural areas in particular, this requires the full cooperation of the Voluntary Civil Defense Committees (CVDC) in respecting and contributing to the climate of peace necessary for the successful holding of the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">We also hope that the negotiations between the Government of Guatemala and the URNG will make possible an early agreement on "the socio-economic aspects and the agrarian situation", in the positive spirit that moves both sides, under a renewed effort to complete as soon as possible an agreement on a firm and lasting peace.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa12">The European Union encourages the parties to continue on this track, and welcomes the mediating role of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and of the moderator of the peace process in Guatemala, with the assistance of the "Group of Friends", aimed at facilitating the successful completion of the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa13">The Member States of the European Union have sponsored draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.69.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.69</a>, prepared by the "Group of Friends", just introduced by the representative of Mexico. The draft would extend the mandate of MINUGUA for an additional period of six months, until 18 March 1996, in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary-General contained in his report of 12 August last. We do this on the understanding that additional costs for funding the Mission from 1 January until 18 March 1996 will be met from within resources allocated for that purpose in the programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997. We hope the General Assembly will adopt this draft by consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa14">In compliance with this draft, MINUGUA will consolidate and extend its tasks to include verification of the human rights aspects of the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, signed by the Government of Guatemala and the URNG on 31 March 1995. This will allow the Mission to deepen its deterrent effect on violations of human rights and progressively to eradicate the culture of impunity, with the cooperation of the parties in the Guatemala peace process and Guatemalan society as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa15">The European Union considers that, through the presence of MINUGUA, the United Nations is contributing actively and positively to the Guatemala peace process, helping and encouraging the parties to reach a firm and lasting peace, which would allow the establishment of the foundations of democracy and development and of a true national reconciliation, in a climate of liberty and justice.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa16">The progress in the peace negotiations and the forthcoming elections on 12 November underline the fact that the people of Guatemala eagerly wish to join the dynamic of peace, democracy and development that Central America is experiencing. We trust that, thanks to the commitment of the parties, this hope may soon be a reality for every citizen of Guatemala.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Biørn Lian</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">Norway is a member of the "Group of Friends" and a sponsor of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.69.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.69</a>, and I should therefore like to make a statement on this item.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Timetables in the negotiating process in Guatemala have been hard to keep, and it now looks highly unlikely that a final peace agreement will be signed during the present presidency. Although this is regrettable, it should not call for a wavering of the efforts of the United Nations and the international community to accomplish and support peace in Guatemala. The negotiations are difficult, but it is important to keep in mind that an extremely significant Agreement on the Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples was signed in March, and that progress is being made on the issue of socio-economic aspects and the agrarian situation.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">The momentum of the peace process must be maintained. There is reason to hope that the upcoming elections will strengthen the democratic institutions of Guatemala. Sectors which traditionally have not participated in the electoral process have on this occasion taken a much more positive approach. The electorate has a wider choice of political alternatives, and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) is encouraging the Guatemalans to take advantage of their right to vote, and has also declared a unilateral cease-fire in the two weeks prior to the elections. It is extremely important that the new president, as well as the major parties in the new national assembly, feel a commitment to the peace process. The recent Contadora Declaration augurs well in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The establishment and deployment in Guatemala of the Mission for the Verification of Human Rights (MINUGUA) represent a significant step forward in the peace process. The presence of MINUGUA induces the parties to the armed conflict to respect their commitments, and it has given renewed hope to the civilian population that peace, justice, reconstruction and national reconciliation may become a reality in Guatemala. Meanwhile, the Members of the United Nations have to ensure that MINUGUA is given the necessary means to fulfil its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">The Government Peace Commission, as well as the URNG, now seem to have a constructive and realistic approach to the peace negotiations. It is important that all sectors of Guatemalan society show the same spirit. Peace is a necessary first step before the people of Guatemala can address the tremendous challenges of an economic and social nature which are facing them. For some sectors it may be necessary to relinquish some of their privileges in order to make Guatemala a better place to live for all Guatemalans. Massive participation in the upcoming elections would be a very encouraging signal that the Guatemalans are ready, through peaceful means, to take their destiny in their own hands. In these endeavours they should be able to count on the continued assistance and support of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">It is against this background that we recommend the adoption by consensus of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.69.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.69</a> on the renewal of the mandate of MINUGUA for a further period of six months.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Perfiliev</span> <span class="non-nation">Director, General Assembly Affairs Division, Department of Political Affairs</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I should like to inform members that if the General Assembly were to adopt draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.69.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.69</a> it would, <i>inter alia</i>, decide to authorize the renewal of the mandate of the Mission for a further period of six months, that is, until 18 March 1996, in accordance with the recommendations of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">In the context of its adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-236.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/236</a> A, the General Assembly approved the additional appropriations required to finance the current mandate period and authorized the Secretary-General to allocate additional resources in 1995 if the mandate of the Mission were again renewed. The Secretary-General does not anticipate that the implementation of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.69.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.69</a> would require any resources greater than those approved for the period 1994-1995.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">With regard to additional resources for 1996, it is the Secretary-General's intention to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session giving fuller details of the implementation of the Mission's mandate, as well as proposals for the General Assembly's approval regarding the necessary appropriations under the programme budget for 1996 to 1997.</p>

	<p id="pg015-bk05-pa01">I wish to express the gratitude of the people and Government of Guatemala to the international community, represented in the General Assembly, for having demonstrated once again its firm commitment to the Guatemalan peace process by renewing for the second time the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala, under the draft resolution that has just been adopted by consensus. Thus, the recommendation which the Secretary-General made in his report of 11 August, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-49-955.pdf" class="pdf">document A/49/955</a>, has been approved. Our appreciation goes particularly to the Group of Friends of the Guatemala peace process and the other sponsors of the draft resolution just adopted. I hardly need to say that we remain deeply grateful to the Secretary-General for his continued support of the peace process and to his colleagues in this noble endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk05-pa02">The Government of Guatemala has done all it can to respond appropriately to the exemplary work that has been and continues to be done by the Mission to help Guatemala solve the most acute and painful of the many problems it faces. This involves the imperative need to establish a firm and lasting peace, which is a necessary condition for the exercise of human rights, the consolidation of democratic institutions and, on those essential foundations, the beginning of economic progress. The need to move ahead in this area is particularly important given the extreme poverty of a considerable part of the population.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk05-pa03">We regret that the achievement of agreements with the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) has not kept up with the new agreed timetable. It is worth noting, however, that on the very day of the last renewal of the Mission, 31 March this year, the sixth of a series of agreements between the Government and the URNG was signed. This was the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which the parties have agreed to implement immediately with respect to human rights. In the report I mentioned earlier, the Secretary-General expresses the view that this Agreement is</p>
	<blockquote id="pg015-bk05-pa04">"a very auspicious development at the beginning of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People". (<i><a href="../pdf/A-49-955.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/955</a>, para. 2</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg015-bk05-pa05">My Government also wishes to emphasize that, as the Secretary-General says in his report, a new impetus has been given to the negotiations with the URNG, while the parties have shown the necessary political will to continue to forge ahead. Other positive elements also worthy of mention are indicated by the Secretary-General in paragraph 5 of his report. Among them are the virtual cessation of forcible military conscription, the widespread exercise of freedom of expression, the readiness of the authorities to promote the investigation and solution of crimes, and the fact that the organization of new voluntary civil defence committees has not been encouraged. At this time, the parties are negotiating, in the Mexican city of Puebla, on the important subject of social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk05-pa06">Thus, despite the deep-rooted and persistent social and institutional factors that have long affected the country, there is reason to hope that in the not-too-distant future this situation -- which to a certain extent is a remnant of the cold war -- will be rectified, leading to the achievement of the permanent peace which remains the most fervent hope of the people of Guatemala.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk05-pa07">We have no doubt that the obstacles to a definitive peace in Guatemala will soon be overcome. When that goal is reached, the contribution of the United Nations will certainly have been essential.</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa05">Before concluding my report on the work of the Fifth Committee at this forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, I should like to thank the Secretariat of the Fifth Committee, and in particular Mr. Joseph Acakpo-Satchivi, to whom I would pay special tribute. I must point out that the Secretariat of the Fifth Committee requires a further strengthening of its human resources in order to be able to discharge its functions in respect of the Fifth Committee and the Committee for Programme and Coordination, and I would appeal to the General Assembly to take this into account immediately at the beginning of the next session of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa01">The delegation of Ukraine wishes to express its satisfaction at the General Assembly's adoption of the draft resolution on the relocation of Belarus to group C in the special scale of assessments for peace-keeping operations. We believe this is a step in the right direction. It will lead to the removal of those glaring contradictions that, unfortunately, because of familiar circumstances, still interfere with the establishment of normal conditions with regard to countries' participation in the financing of the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa02">More than two years ago the Government of Ukraine appealed to Members of the Organization to relocate our State from group B to group C in the special scale of assessments for peace-keeping operations. However, even now, when most Member States recognize that Ukraine's presence in group B is one of the paradoxes of the current financial situation, a solution to the problem has not been found.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa03">As a result of its difficult economic situation, and also because of its excessively large contribution to the financing of the activities of the United Nations, particularly peace-keeping operations, Ukraine has now become one of the major debtor countries <i>vis-à-vis </i>the Organization. In confirmation of our commitment to the ideas of the financial viability and health of the United Nations, which can be achieved through the implementation of a comprehensive reform, our delegation wishes to declare that our Government can no longer continue to accept the existing situation.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa04">During the forthcoming session of the General Assembly, Ukraine will take measures aimed at an immediate decision on relocating us to group C. In the final analysis, such a decision will lead to improving and stabilizing the financial situation of the United Nations.</p>
