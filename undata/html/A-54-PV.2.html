	<div class="p">All members of the General Assembly are eligible in this election except those already represented in the General Committee, namely those countries whose representatives have been elected to the presidency of the General Assembly or to the chairmanships of the Main Committees.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-33-138">resolution 33/138</a>, the 21 Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session shall be elected according to the following pattern:</div>

	<div class="p">Latin American and Caribbean States: Bolivia, Cuba, Grenada.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">Western European and Other States: Iceland, Monaco.</div>

	<div class="p">The Assembly will now turn its attention to document <a href="../pdf/A-54-313">A/54/313</a>, which contains a letter dated 2 September 1999 from the Chairman of the Committee on Conferences addressed to the President of the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Members are aware that, pursuant to section I, paragraph 7 of Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-40-243">resolution 40/243</a>, no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly should be permitted to meet at United Nations Headquarters during the main part of a regular session of the Assembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">As indicated in the letter I have just mentioned, the Committee on Conferences has recommended that the General Assembly authorize, among others, the Committee on Relations with the Host County and the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund to meet during the main part of the fifty-fourth session.</div>
	<div class="p">Having been informed by the Secretariat that the meetings of these two subsidiary organs will begin as early as the first week of the fifty-fourth session of the Assembly, may I take it that the General Assembly adopts the recommendation of the Committee on Conferences regarding these two subsidiary organs?</div>
