	Mr. Kamal (Pakistan)

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa01">The informatics revolution which started some years ago has now gained a momentum of astronomical proportions. It is radically transforming all areas of human activity. The entire decision-making and strategy-planning processes of Governments and the private sector depend heavily today on information and communication technology. Information technology has thus become the lifeblood of our domestic and global markets.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa02">While this revolution constitutes one of the greatest opportunities in human history, it also poses unprecedented challenges. One of these is the year 2000 (Y2K) problem. The very first minute of the new millennium will bring the world face-to-face squarely with the challenge of this global virus, crawling forwards and backwards into the deepest nooks and crannies of our worldwide network of computers.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa03">Considering the enormity and complexity of the Y2K problem, our response has to be predicated on a certain set of basic assumptions. First, the problem has wide implications, not just for computers, but indeed for all equipments which use embedded chips. Secondly, the omnipresent nature of these embedded chips makes it virtually impossible to correctly fathom the full degree of the problem or even to identify all the affected sectors. Thirdly, this is a problem which is global in nature and its solution will have to be found globally, without making any distinctions based on per capita computer projections. Fourthly, the deadline of 31 December 1999 is totally immutable, so that all corrective action will have to be completed before that deadline -- in fact, much earlier. Fifthly and finally, this challenge, because of its very global nature, presents an opportunity for international collaboration in seeking an international response to an international problem.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa04">It is for these reasons that the United Nations has come into play in trying to resolve this problem. Action in the United Nations on Y2K is subdivided into two distinct parts. In the first place, action has to be taken within the secretariats of the United Nations system, not just in New York, but also at all the other main United Nations stations, in order to ensure compliance. In the second place, action has to be coordinated globally in the Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa05">Under the auspices of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Informatics and its task force, action started within the United Nations Secretariat last year. We hope that the United Nations system will be compliant well in time, before the dawn of the new millennium. However, the second area of action in the Members States is much more complicated. The States Members of the United Nations are at various levels of development. Some have millions of computers and billions of embedded chips in use; others count them in hundreds only. But both face the same challenge because of the deep interconnections in the global network of computer links.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa06">While many Member States have already started systematic efforts to address the need for Y2K compliance, there are many others which are not yet fully aware of the nature and magnitude of this international problem. Awareness and action levels have not attained the required stage or speed necessitated by the deadline of 31 December 1999. Given the importance that deserves to be attached to this problem, action is now being brought before the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa07">Pakistan has the honour to present the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.75-Rev.1.pdf">A/52/L.75/Rev.1</a> The draft resolution is the result of wide consultations and is action-oriented and forward-looking. It not only highlights the gravity of the Y2K problem, but calls specifically on Governments to attach due priority to national action and global cooperation. It calls upon the Economic and Social Council to prepare guidelines at its forthcoming substantive session to enable Member States to address the diverse aspects of the problem. It requests the Secretary-General to ensure compliance within all parts of the United Nations system; and it calls for a monitoring and reporting system within the United Nations, so that action is completed well before the deadline.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa08">While the draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the United Nations system closely monitors actual and potential sources of funding to support the efforts of the developing countries and countries in transition to address the Y2K problem, it also expresses its appreciation at the establishment of a Trust Fund by the World Bank to assist in the efforts to resolve the problem with substantial voluntary contributions from Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa09">We hope that the draft resolution will be adopted by consensus. The Pakistan delegation will continue to hold itself in readiness to be of all assistance in this Y2K endeavour, as it has done in all aspects of the vitally important subject of informatics.</div>

	Mr. Sklar (United States)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01">I am pleased to express the support of the United States for the draft resolution on the global implications of the year 2000 problem. In a world vastly dependent upon electronic systems for the processing and exchange of financial and other data, it is imperative that nations address the year 2000 problem now. Those which fail to do so risk serious disruption to critical business and government functions. And with the inflexible deadline of 31 December 1999 fast approaching, there is truly no time to waste. Probably no other issue that has come before this body is of such common interest to all Members, large and small, developed and undeveloped. We are all dependent upon a solution to this problem, and we are all interconnected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">This is an international problem that has implications for every nation. More than any other technological challenge we face, the year 2000 problem highlights the interconnectedness of today's world. Year 2000-related system failures in key areas such as international telecommunications, banking and transportation in any one country could have effects on many other countries. Nations not only need to address the problem within their own borders but must share information and expertise on possible solutions internationally. The need for this kind of cooperation was one of the key reasons we worked hard to raise the issue at the recent Birmingham G-8 Summit, and why we were so pleased to work closely with the United Nations Working Group on Informatics on the year 2000 resolution. We also look forward to the elaboration of guidelines for Member States, to be set out by the Economic and Social Council at its upcoming substantive session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa03">The draft resolution recognizes that the problem affects more than just large mainframe systems. Electronic devices with date-sensitive microprocessors or embedded chips are also at risk. Unchecked, this "growth industry" of the problem has the potential to cause failures in everything from manufacturing equipment to traffic signals. We believe that, in addition to dealing with system challenges, countless countries need to pay close attention to this important aspect of the year 2000 problem. This was brought home to me personally when I asked how I should deal with the two portable computers I use every day, and it was simply suggested that the problem is so complex that I should be prepared to throw them into the wastebasket next year and buy new units to replace them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa04">We also encourage every nation to examine its year 2000 readiness, and not just in governmental systems. Government officials should be making inquiries on the status of preparations in the private sector, especially with regard to key infrastructure areas, including energy, telecommunications, transportation and financial institutions. Member States should appoint national year 2000 coordinators at the highest level. We have already done so. A coordinator can help countries raise awareness of the problem among public and private sector organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa05">Finally, we encourage every nation to think about contingency plans for critical business processes as we move towards the new millennium. By this fall, we will have reached a point where, despite all of the best efforts to prepare, some systems for which no year 2000 remediation efforts have begun will not be ready by 1 January 2000. We encourage nations to develop contingency plans for those critical business processes that are most at risk of experiencing failures.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa06">Both my delegation and I, personally, would like to thank Ambassador Kamal for his extraordinary leadership and for leading the Working Group on Informatics and to thank him and the Group for all their hard work on this important draft resolution and for raising the level of awareness of the year 2000 problem generally within the United Nations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa01">The global implications of the year 2000 date conversion problem for computers are a matter of deep concern, particularly to developing countries. On behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I should like to say that we expect that, with the consensus adoption of this draft resolution, we will be able to assist developing countries with their limited capacity to absorb and comprehend, let alone apply, the new information technology such as that relating to the year 2000. We therefore support the draft resolution and extend our heartfelt appreciation to Ambassador Kamal for his invaluable efforts in coming up with this very important draft resolution.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa01">I have the honour to make this statement on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated country Cyprus, as well as the European Free Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area, Iceland and Norway, align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa02">The European Union welcomes the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-233.pdf">resolution 52/233</a>, on the global implications of the year 2000 date conversion problem for computers. This issue has, we believe, potentially far-reaching implications for the effective operation of Governments, companies and other organizations worldwide. The European Union had already placed the issue on the agendas of last December's meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg and April's second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM II) in London. We are pleased to see that the problem is now being addressed in the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa03">The European Union believes that the priority of the United Nations system in this area should be to ensure that the computer systems within United Nations control are millennium-compliant. This resolution asks the Secretary-General to adopt a plan of action and to report back to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session on the implementation of that plan. In the context of the Economic and Social Council Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Informatics, Member States have been assured by the Secretariat that computers throughout the United Nations system are already millennium-compliant. The European Union hopes that the Secretariat will take the opportunity of the report to the fifty-third session to place these assurances, and the basis for them, on the record.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa04">The United Nations system has a further responsibility: to raise awareness of this problem and the potential means of addressing it. The United Nations Web site, and that of the United Nations Development Programme, already contain useful information. This work should be pursued with a view to ensuring the widest possible dissemination. The resolution also calls on the Economic and Social Council to prepare a series of guidelines on which Member States might draw in addressing the problem. The European Union will be ready to work positively in this regard at next month's substantive session of the Economic and Social Council.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk05-pa05">The European Union believes that the primary responsibility for addressing the year 2000 date conversion problem rests with national Governments and the private sector. But if these efforts are to be successful, a collaborative approach will be required. Key actors will include the Bretton Woods institutions, in particular the World Bank, and the myriad companies which make up the private sector of the global economy. It is gratifying to see that in this resolution the United Nations is taking up its share of the responsibility. We should not lose sight of this responsibility in the short time available before the deadline of December 1999.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa02">We believe that the electronic interdependency of the States Members of the United Nations in today's rapidly growing information-based society is an important element of the world economy. As members are aware, this question received very serious consideration at the recent meeting of the Group of Eight in Birmingham. It is our view that with respect to resolving the year 2000 problem, which could have a negative impact on the smooth functioning of the global informational infrastructure and on the world economy as a whole, the United Nations has responded rapidly to the situation. We believe that this redounds to the credit of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Informatics of the Economic and Social Council and its Chairman, Ambassador Kamal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa03">In conclusion, I should like to inform the Assembly that in the Russian Federation this question is also receiving very serious consideration and that the Government has already adopted a resolution on resolving the year 2000 problem.</div>

	Mr. Sklar (United States)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk04-pa01">I wish to take this opportunity to explain the vote of the United States delegation on the resolution entitled "Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk04-pa02">I seek the Assembly's indulgence in making this explanation, as my delegation had previously explained its position when this issue was voted upon in the Fifth Committee last month. However, I believe it is important to reaffirm our position so that it can be better understood by all delegations present today, and since it is a matter of principle.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk04-pa03">Our opposition to the present resolution is based on its relationship to last year's resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-233.pdf">resolution 51/233</a>), which we opposed and which is not a consensus resolution of this world body. We remain deeply concerned about paragraphs 7 and 8 of that resolution, which decided that costs of $1,773,618 -- which stemmed from the incident at the United Nations headquarters of the Force at Qana on 18 April 1996 -- should be borne by Israel. We believe that United Nations <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-233.pdf">resolution 51/233</a>, and those portions of the current resolution which refer to it, jeopardize important points of principle for United Nations operations and politicize the work of the Fifth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk04-pa04">The use of a General Assembly funding resolution to pursue claims against a Member State is not correct procedurally. Since shortly after the inception of the United Nations, the procedure which has been followed is that the Secretary-General presents and pursues settlement of the Organization's claim against a State or States. This procedure was first begun in 1946 in the Middle East and continues today for peacekeeping-related damage claims in the Balkans. Using a funding resolution to legislate settlement is inappropriate. It also politicizes the work of the Fifth Committee and should be avoided in the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk04-pa05">Because of our concerns, the United States worked in good faith to find a compromise during the recently concluded resumed session of the Fifth Committee, similar to our efforts last year when this issue first arose. We sought a consensus text that did not set an undesirable precedent, or raise issues of the legality of the Committee's action or politicize the technical tasks assigned to the Fifth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk04-pa06">As we said at the Fifth Committee meeting last month, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is an organization which is implementing a difficult and important mandate. We strongly support it in its attempts to fulfil that mandate. We regret that a consensus text without politicization on renewing the funding for UNIFIL could not be achieved.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa01">The member States of the Group of 77 and China are deeply concerned that, despite our continued and sincere wish to take action by consensus, the General Assembly has once again taken a decision on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) by vote. It is a matter of principle for the Group of 77 and China that General Assembly resolutions and decisions be fully respected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa02">In this regard, the Secretary-General and the responsible party should fully implement the provisions of the resolution that we have just adopted, as well as those of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-233.pdf">resolution 51/233</a>, which was adopted on 13 June 1997.</div>

	Mr. Najem (Lebanon)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa01">The resolution on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) that we have just adopted merely reaffirms that it is up to the aggressor, Israel, to fulfil its international obligations and implement all the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly. Our position is based on the idea that the aggressor should assume full responsibility for its aggression, especially if that aggression is premeditated and deliberate, runs counter to the will of the international community and results in thousands of victims.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa02">I wish to stress that this does not in any way mean that Lebanon does not believe in the principle of collective responsibility. On the contrary, we reaffirm our solid commitment to respect this principle. However, we do not wish there to be a precedent set in the history of this Organization whereby one Member State of the United Nations undertakes aggression against another Member State and then shelters itself behind the flag of the United Nations. The aggressor State should assume its responsibility for losses caused by its actions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa03">We do not want a precedent to be established in that respect, and we do not want to encourage such aggression in the future. Lebanon believes that Israel's continuing occupation of parts of Bekaa and southern Lebanon, its failure to respect Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">resolution 425 (1978)</a> and its daily, repeated acts of aggression are responsible for the cycle of violence in southern Lebanon and the problems faced by UNIFIL and the Lebanese civilians in southern Lebanon. Israel, like other States, must comply with the will of the international community and abide by the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, including in particular Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">resolution 425 (1978)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa04">I should like, on behalf of Lebanon, warmly to thank the Group of 77 and China for having adopted the Arab Group's position on the financing of UNIFIL. Moreover, and in the name of my Government, I wish to pay tribute to the active and pioneering role played by UNIFIL and to thank all the members of that Force. I should also like to thank all those States, without exception, that have supported the financing of UNIFIL, especially in its work for peace in the region. The presence of UNIFIL in Lebanon is of great importance.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk03-pa01">The delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic would like to explain its vote on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-237.pdf">resolution 52/237</a>, on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). In adopting this resolution, the General Assembly has again affirmed Israel's responsibility for the expenses resulting from its terrorist attack on the United Nations headquarters at Qana on 18 April 1996, an attack that was condemned by the United Nations at the time.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk03-pa02">This is the second year that the General Assembly has considered the consequences of the crime committed by Israel against UNIFIL in Lebanon. UNIFIL was originally established as a result of Israel's aggression against southern Lebanon. Israel's aggression against UNIFIL added a further crime to its record, which is replete with crimes, massacres and inhumane practices against the Arabs of the occupied Arab territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk03-pa03">Israel's disregard of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-233.pdf">resolution 51/233</a>, which required it to provide compensation -- token compensation -- for the damages incurred as a result of its many crimes, should not be overlooked and allowed to occur with impunity. This Assembly must hold Israel responsible; Israel must not remain a rogue State, acting outside international law, as has always been its practice.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk03-pa04">My delegation expects Member States to remember that the terrorist attack by Israel against UNIFIL resulted in bloodshed and destruction, the consequences of which are still apparent at the headquarters of the Force and elsewhere in southern Lebanon. United Nations soldiers, who come from various parts of the world in response to the United Nations call for peacekeeping in Lebanon, are threatened every time Lebanese civilians, who are trying to defend their land, children, families and dignity, take refuge in the headquarters of the Force.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk03-pa05">The Syrian Arab Republic reaffirms its consistent position that Israel should be called upon to pay not only the costs of its aggression against the UNIFIL headquarters, where innocent Lebanese civilians sought protection and refuge; Israel, which took pleasure in adopting a policy of force, occupation and aggression, is also responsible for financing the Force completely.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk03-pa06">Syria affirms that the adoption of this resolution is a victory for the principles of right, justice and peace, which the entire international community, with the exception of Israel, is working to achieve. Israel, which pays no heed to the principles and objectives of the United Nations or the Fourth Geneva Convention in particular, will not even fulfil the simplest financial obligation provided for in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-233.pdf">resolution 51/233</a>, which openly called upon Israel to assume responsibility for the costs of its aggression against UNIFIL in southern Lebanon.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk03-pa07">My delegation thanks all the countries that supported the resolution. Israel's responsibility for the financial obligations referred to in the resolution is clear proof of its responsibility for the aggression against UNIFIL at Qana in southern Lebanon.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk15-pa01">I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union, under agenda item 142, on the apportionment of the costs of peacekeeping operations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk15-pa02">The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and the associated country Cyprus -- as well as the European Free Trade Association country, member of the European Economic Area, Norway, align themselves with this statement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk15-pa03">The European Union welcomed the distribution in the Fifth Committee, on 29 May 1998, of the paper containing the requested update of the relationship between peacekeeping assessment shares of Member States and their respective per capita incomes. This information had been supplied earlier, in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-47-484">A/47/484</a>, following a request from the General Assembly in <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-46-240">resolution 46/240</a> of 22 May 1992.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk15-pa04">In that context, the General Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to report on the anomalies in the allocation of Member States to the four groups in the ad hoc peacekeeping scale. The document eventually produced gave a starting point for the debate on the elimination of those anomalies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk15-pa05">As representatives will be aware, as long ago as January 1996 the European Union put forward in the High-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations a comprehensive package of measures aimed at resolving the financial crisis of the Organization. One of the elements contained in that package was a call for the revision of the scale of assessments for peacekeeping operations to make it more equitable, transparent and automatically adjustable to take into account altered economic circumstances, while continuing to take account of the needs of Member States with below average per capita incomes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk15-pa06">It is because of the importance that the European Union attaches to this proposal that we asked for the updated information, which we received. We made that request in our statement delivered in the first resumed session of the Fifth Committee, on 10 March, and again in the Fifth Committee's formal meeting of 18 May. In the information note which was issued on 29 May, as an informal paper rather than as an official conference room paper, we are provided with useful and revealing information. We shall need to analyse the data further, and will revert to it in due course under this, the appropriate agenda item. However, it is already clear from the updated information we have now received that the number of discrepancies in the relationship between peacekeeping assessment shares of Member States and their respective per capital incomes has increased. A significant number of group C countries with above average gross national product are receiving unwarranted subsidies, not only from those Member States that pay their assessed contributions in full and on time, but also from those countries which, if there were a change in the group system, would more deservedly benefit from it. This surely indicates the need for a radical but equitable change to the current system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk15-pa07">It is our firm opinion that this matter should be dealt with under agenda item 142, where we address the financing of peacekeeping operations, and as we did in December 1997 in the context of the allocation to the scale of Slovakia. In order to do this properly, there must be transparency and free access to information by all Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk15-pa08">It is unacceptable to the European Union that Member States should not be given the full information which they request, in order to better inform us in our deliberations on this, or indeed any item before the Fifth Committee. This is a matter of principle for the European Union.</div>

On the first subject, I will speak on behalf of the delegations of Australia, New Zealand and my own country, Canada. On the second subject, I shall pass the microphone to my colleague for a statement on behalf of Canada alone.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa02">With regard to the first subject, many delegations from time to time have requested that the Secretariat provide information to the Fifth Committee, whether orally or in the form of conference room papers; and that information has been provided. Our delegations, as a matter of firm principle, have supported the right of each and every delegation to request information from the Secretariat and to have it provided to all.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa03">It is a matter of the greatest concern to our delegations that some members of the Fifth Committee, whether in their national capacities or as members of the Bureau of the Fifth Committee, have sought to interfere with the right of delegations to request and receive information, and even to engage in prior censorship of such information. We hope that they are cognizant of the seriousness of what they have attempted.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa04">There are broader implications which go well beyond the Fifth Committee. It is not possible to restrict any of the rights of any delegation or group of delegations without similarly restricting the rights of all delegations. We hope that delegations will agree that the work of the Fifth Committee must be guided by transparency to enable the General Assembly to reach fair and logical decisions in the most efficient manner, to enable the Fifth Committee to serve the Assembly in the best possible way, and to enable the Fifth Committee to support the mandated activities of the United Nations in the best possible way.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa01">Our delegation joined consensus on the resolution entitled "Support account for peacekeeping operations". However, we regret that the General Assembly is not yet able to fund the establishment of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters (RDMHQ) from the support account. We believe that if the United Nations is to live up to the Charter's claim of collective responsibility for dealing with threats to international peace and security it must improve its capability to act when required, or it must default on this core responsibility.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa02">In paragraph 81 of its report, document <a href="../pdf/A-50-230.pdf">A/50/230</a> of 22 June 1995, the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations urged</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg017-bk02-pa03">"the Secretary-General to develop a rapidly deployable headquarters team composed of personnel skilled in essential military and civilian headquarters functions".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa04">The Committee's report, and the subsequent General Assembly resolution, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-50-30.pdf">resolution 50/30</a>, were adopted by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa05">During July 1996, the Secretary-General instructed the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to implement the rapidly deployable mission headquarters within the Department. In his progress report on the standby arrangements system, document S/1996/1067 of 24 December 1996, the Secretary-General stated that he had decided to establish the skeleton of an RDMHQ within the Secretariat to</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg017-bk02-pa06">"ensure that the deployment and initial phases of a peacekeeping operation receive the necessary management and guidance". [para. 13]</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa07">Plans to staff the eight posts of the RDMHQ implementation team with, first, gratis officers and, secondly, bilaterally funded officers were discarded due to concerns about equitable geographical distribution of those eight posts. The third option, a United Nations trust fund, was instituted in order to raise sufficient funding to implement and support the activities of the RDMHQ until more stable, predictable funding could be arranged. However, the trust fund was never intended to become a perpetual source of funding for the RDMHQ.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa08">An important development has taken place since the RDMHQ trust fund was started. Last year, the Secretary-General's Track 2 reform proposals contained a recommendation that the Security Council and the General Assembly should consider measures to enhance the rapid deployment capacity of the United Nations. This recommendation was endorsed by consensus in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-12.pdf">resolution 52/12</a> B, section C, paragraph 6, which requested the appropriate organs to consider, as a matter of priority, specific measures to enhance the rapid deployment capacity of the United Nations in peacekeeping.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa09">Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1159(1998).pdf">resolution 1159 (1998)</a> of 27 March 1998 authorized a new United Nations peacekeeping mission known as the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA). The Secretariat was instructed to establish a new field mission headquarters in Bangui and take over authority for the Mission on 15 April 1998. Because the RDHMQ does not yet exist, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had to assemble an ad hoc headquarters staff on only 19 days' notice. While they were able to establish the headquarters as instructed, the entire process would have been greatly simplified if the RDMHQ had been in existence because its core personnel would have provided continuity to the MINURCA planning process which originated in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations some time ago.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa10">Chapter I, Article 1, of the United Nations Charter states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to take collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. Peacekeeping is one of the measures developed to undertake this collective responsibility. One of the key weaknesses of United Nations peacekeeping has always been the inability of the Organization to quickly establish a new field mission headquarters capable of providing effective control of an operation. The need to adopt specific measures to improve the Organization's capacity to rapidly deploy a new peacekeeping mission has been identified as a priority recommendation in the Track 2 reform package and has been endorsed, as I mentioned earlier, in General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-12.pdf">resolution 52/12</a> B.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa11">The RDMHQ trust fund was intended as an interim mechanism and not a perpetual source of funds for this purpose. The Secretariat support account submission recommended the funding of eight posts for the RDMHQ implementation team. The Secretariat has also clarified the specific rule and organizational relationship of the RDMHQ. Support account funding will ensure that the eight posts can be staffed on the basis of equitable geographic distribution without the need to employ gratis officers. The new MINURCA mission in the Central African Republic is a perfect example of why the United Nations still requires this headquarters.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa12">Canada remains committed to the RDMHQ concept and intends to seek a thorough consideration of this important initiative during the forthcoming post-by-post review.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk01-pa02">We would like to amplify a little bit upon Canada's first statement, which it made for itself, Australia and New Zealand, on a matter also alluded to in the concluding remarks of the European Union. During the course of this year's Fifth Committee debate, transparency, which must be the watchword of this Organization, i.e., the ability of any Member to request information and get it, was aborted and thwarted, possibly, it seems, by Members in positions of power in the Bureau of the Fifth Committee. Those in positions of responsibility have an extra responsibility to ensure that information requested and prepared will be transmitted in full and in no way retarded, edited or censored.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg019-bk05-pa03">Reactions varied when that request for documents was made during formal meetings of the Fifth Committee. Some were in favour of issuing those documents, while other delegations, notably those of the Group of 77 and China, formally expressed their wish that the debate not take place at that juncture because the Fifth Committee had a number of other items on its agenda.
