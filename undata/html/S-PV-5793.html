</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Løvald</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I am grateful for this opportunity to participate in the Council's discussions concerning Burundi in my capacity as Chair of the country-specific meetings on Burundi in the Peacebuilding Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The Secretary-General's report on the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi (BINUB) (<a href="../pdf/S-2007-682.pdf" class="pdf">S/2007/682</a>) outlines peacebuilding priorities that are also highlighted in the Peacebuilding Commission's work on Burundi, from the security situation and implementation of the Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement, political development and governance, transitional justice, security sector reform and rule of law to economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The Peacebuilding Commission takes a comprehensive approach to its work and hence is particularly concerned about how the various priorities relate to each other in the overall peacebuilding effort.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Let me focus on three issues of particular relevance to the Security Council. First, the conclusions and recommendations on peacebuilding in Burundi forwarded to the President of the Security Council in my letter dated 20 September 2007 (PBC-2-BDI-2) addressed some of the key challenges facing the country at that time, including the implementation of the Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement between the Government of Burundi and PALIPEHUTU-FNL. The Peacebuilding Commission recommended to the Council that it continue to closely monitor the situation in Burundi, in particular with respect to the effective implementation of the Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement, and that it consider, if necessary, undertaking appropriate action with a view to the effective implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement by the set date.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">It was indeed timely that the Facilitator of the Burundi Peace Process, Mr. Charles Nqakula, Minister of Safety and Security of South Africa, addressed the Council last week on the implementation of the Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement (see <a href="../html/S-PV-5786.html">S/PV.5786</a>). It was encouraging that the members of the Council gave their full support to the efforts of the Regional Initiative and the Facilitator. I recall that the Peacebuilding Commission, in its conclusions and recommendations of 20 September, voiced similar support.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">Given the continuing urgency of this issue today, I wish to reiterate the Peacebuilding Commission's recommendation to the Security Council that it closely monitor the situation and undertake appropriate action.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">Secondly, given the present challenges facing Burundi, political stability is particularly important. The newly reshuffled Cabinet in Burundi and the end of the parliamentary boycott represent important and positive developments. They are examples of resolving political differences within the democratically established institutions. The Government of Burundi and the leaders of the political parties in parliament should be commended for their efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">Thirdly, before I conclude, let me update the Council on the latest developments in the Burundi configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission. Since the Security Council last discussed BINUB's mandate, in May, the Peacebuilding Commission has concluded the development of a Strategic Framework for Peacebuilding in Burundi and yesterday adopted a Monitoring and Tracking Mechanism for that Framework. This was a critical step for the Peacebuilding Commission's engagement with Burundi. It is the foundation for the implementation and review process which we are about to enter. It has also been an achievement in itself because of the way it was developed -- together with the Government of Burundi and following consultations with key stakeholders on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">As I mentioned in my statement to the Security Council during its meeting in October on the Peacebuilding Commission's annual report (see</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10"><a href="../html/S-PV-5761.html">S/PV.5761</a>), while we have focused so far on peacebuilding priorities, we are now shifting our focus to the question of how to follow up on these priorities. In other words, we are moving from identification to implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">In this regard, I take note of the Secretary-General's call for the Peacebuilding Commission to put additional emphasis on sustaining international attention with respect to Burundi and on facilitating the marshalling of resources for peacebuilding and reconstruction efforts in the country. That will indeed be an essential role for the Commission and its members in reviewing the Strategic Framework. The continued support of the Security Council and other major organs of the United Nations remains crucial.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the Permanent Representative of Norway, Mr. Johan Løvald, for the briefing he delivered in his capacity as Chair of the country-specific meetings on Burundi in the Peacebuilding Commission. I am certain that I speak on behalf of all the members of the Council in thanking him. What he has told us confirms that the Peacebuilding Commission's current actions, and its interaction with the Security Council and, of course, with the General Assembly, make a difference.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">On behalf of the members of the Council, I also wish to express appreciation for Mr. Løvald's point that the Commission is ready to move from the identification phase to the implementation phase. I think that that is a crucial point.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">There being no further speakers inscribed on my list, and in accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations, I should now like to invite Council members to informal consultations to continue our discussions on this subject.</p>
