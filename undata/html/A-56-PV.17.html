	Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">As this is the first time that I have had the honour to stand here and address this body, please permit me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Likewise, allow me to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his re-election to a second term. His proven wisdom and compassion are needed more than ever to lead this Organization at this time of world crisis.</div>
	<div class="p">I stand before the Assembly today delivering a speech at a time so sad, and on a topic stirring so much anger and disbelief, that mere words cannot begin to encompass the scope of these emotions.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me express the sincere sympathy and condolences of my Government and the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the victims of the tragedy that struck this city 22 days ago, and to their families and friends. We share their grief and their pain. Andre Cox, a 29-year-old man from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, had recently graduated from college and joined the staff of a company located on the 101st floor of One World Trade Center. He is among the thousands missing due to that dastardly terrorist attack. On a more personal note, my elder sister, Patricia, was, at the time of the attack on the 45 th floor of Two World Trade Center. By the grace of God, she escaped the tower physically unharmed but mentally traumatized. For close to 24 hours, I did not know whether my sister was alive or dead. It seems to me pointless, even selfish, to be thankful for my good fortune at a time when good fortune is the exception rather than the norm. That is the nature of this beast.</div>
	<div class="p">This morning, I visited ground zero, courtesy of the city of New York. The television cameras do not adequately capture the devastation. Amid the rubble are real flesh-and-blood human beings whose lives were cruelly cut short by unspeakable barbarism. It is ironic that as we become more civilized, we become more vulnerable to terrorism. As civilized peoples, we are now faced with a common enemy, one that operates clandestinely but with great sophistication. As Mayor Giuliani said on this same podium two days ago, "We must choose civilization or terror". I believe that every nation must come together now to combat terrorism in order to safeguard security for humanity and the fundamental values of a democratic society. The mass murder and economic peril in New York and Washington were unprecedented. Consequently, unprecedented responses will be required to avert a recurrence. In our collective efforts to fight terrorism, we will no doubt be focused, deliberate and measured. I am confident that, in this way, we will put into motion appropriate mechanisms that will guarantee victory over tyranny without compromising our way of life. But our vigilance must not wane. We must be relentless in our efforts. Terrorism must have no future in our civilization.</div>
	<div class="p">At the same time, we must be aware of the dangers of racial profiling. The hate crimes that have taken place in the aftermath of this tragedy against American citizens of Middle Eastern descent are abhorrent and must not be tolerated. We must also make it abundantly clear that this is not a battle against Islam, a peaceful faith, but against those who twist its teachings in a futile attempt to justify their heinous crimes. The perpetrators of this cowardly act do not represent Islam.</div>
	<div class="p">The world as we know it changed on the eleventh day of September 2001. The impact of the actions of the terrorists is being felt around the globe, and small States such as mine will suffer along with the rest of the world. I have been impressed -- very impressed -- by the statesmanship, resolve and restraint of the President of the United States and other world leaders. But we understand that action must be taken. Let such action, however, be designed to bring the guilty ones to justice or have justice brought to them, and avoid, as far as possible, the spillage of more innocent blood. I am satisfied that this is the focus of all peace-loving nations the world over.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is not parochial. The events of 11 September show us that it has spread its ugly tentacles beyond borders in various forms and manifestations. While we embark on the task of meting out justice to the perpetrators of these despicable acts of terrorism, we must guard against unilateral action, lest we inflict terror on the innocent. However, we must similarly search for and address all the factors attributable to terrorism and its collateral consequences. I say this without in any way seeking to find a justification for those acts. Such acts of mass murder can never be justified. This Assembly is uniquely suited to provide the requisite collective leadership in this endeavour. If some small good has come out of the despicable events of 11 September, it is that nations of the world have united as one to condemn the acts. Moreover, the choice is clear: ennoble civilization or descend into barbarism. I am sure that barbarism and its acolytes will be defeated.</div>
	<div class="p">Falling into line with the international effort to fight terrorism, my Government has already taken steps to tighten security and implement measures to close the loopholes that criminals and terrorists would seek to exploit for their nefarious deeds. In this regard, my Government is working closely with other Caribbean nations and traditional allies in the North Atlantic.</div>
	<div class="p">My very presence and that of my wife in New York indicate that the political leadership in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean will not be intimidated by terrorists and will not deter us from travel. President Bush has reminded us that the skies are safe. Mayor Giuliani has appealed to everyone to return to their normal duties and has asked tourists to continue visiting New York. If my wife and I are safe to travel to New York from beautiful Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, so, too, is it for visitors, tourists, investors and friends from the United States of America, Canada, Europe, Central America, South America and the world over to travel to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean. Anyone who fears travelling has unwittingly succumbed to the evil of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, let me assure the people of the United States, and particularly those of New York City, that the Government and the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines love you dearly. You have provided a home for thousands and thousands of our people. You have an unconquerable spirit -- your wounds will heal fast. We will be there with you as you heal. May God bless you all.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="2-7">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Galuska" nation="Czech Republic" language="">
	Mr. Galuska (Czech Republic)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me at the outset to express heartfelt sympathy on behalf of the Czech Government and the Czech nation to those who lost their loved ones in the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001 and to all the American people. We are deeply moved by this unspeakable tragedy and share their grief. We express our full solidarity with the Government of the United States in its resolve to punish the perpetrators and sponsors of this appalling act and to fight international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism has traditionally been a topic in the agenda of the General Assembly since 1972. Since then, the United Nations has adopted a great many resolutions on this topic and significantly contributed mainly to the creation of a solid legal system consisting up until now of 12 universal criminal conventions aimed at suppressing various forms of terrorism. This shows that the United Nations has never underestimated the threat of terrorism. Nevertheless, this item on the General Assembly's agenda has never appeared to be as urgent and alarming as it is now. Nobody ever foresaw that the scourge of terrorism, however seriously it had been perceived, would someday reach the level of a global and systematic threat to international security comparable to that of armed conflict.</div>
	<div class="p">In the wake of the tragic events of 11 September, the international community's evaluation of the threat of terrorism changed once and for all. If not before, then no doubt on that day international terrorism became a threat to world peace, and it is therefore necessary to fight it accordingly. The United Nations, as the only universal international Organization, is destined to play a primary role in this fight, and I am glad to say that the first actions taken by our Organization after 11 September proved its capability and readiness to live up to these expectations. Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">resolution 1368 (2001)</a>, as well as General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1.pdf">resolution 56/1</a>, put the terrorist attack of 11 September into the above-mentioned context and prepared the ground for Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September, which tackles terrorism in an unprecedented manner, within the framework of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. This historic step promotes to a new level the legal system for suppressing terrorism, which no longer challenges only States parties to the relevant conventions, but the whole international community.</div>
	<div class="p">Despite all these recent efforts, we must continue further in strengthening political and legal instruments in this field. The need to adhere to and implement existing legal instruments was eloquently stressed in the statement of the European Union, delivered in this forum on Monday, 1 October, with which the Czech Republic, as a country associated with the European Union, aligned itself. In this connection, I am proud to say that the Czech Republic has been participating significantly in building up this multilateral legal system. The Czech Republic is a State party to 9 of the 12 sectoral anti-terrorist conventions, including the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, one of the most recent ones, and is a signatory State to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which was signed by President Havel during last year's Millennium Summit.</div>
	<div class="p">Now our legislative bodies are making every effort to adopt the measures necessary in our domestic legislature to implement obligations arising from this Convention, as well as the relevant provisions on the financing of terrorism contained in Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the European Union action plan on terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">As far as the current and future negotiations on new anti-terrorist instruments are concerned, the Czech representatives are ready to do their best to help move forward a comprehensive convention on terrorism this fall. The contribution of the general convention may be enormous if it succeeds in laying down a general definition of terrorism, which represents a missing element for the international political and legal framework in this field.</div>
	<div class="p">Nevertheless, let me emphasize that the Czech Republic does not focus only on multilateral conventions. In order for the work of the Ministry of the Interior and police organs with respect to suppressing terrorism to be effective the Czech Republic is required to enter into bilateral cooperation with a great many countries and the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). For this purpose, the Czech Republic has so far concluded 15 bilateral international agreements on cooperation in fighting organized crime and terrorism, and 15 others are in different stages of preparatory work. In addition, as a country heading for membership in the European Union, the Czech Republic intends to cooperate with the European Police Office (Europol), pending approval of the agreement on cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me to raise one concrete proposal on how to contribute to the above-mentioned strengthening of the international system for suppressing terrorism. As the Assembly may recall, the Secretary-General invited the heads of State and Government attending the Millennium Summit last year to make use of that unique occasion to reaffirm their commitment to the international rule of law by signing and ratifying some of the international conventions deposited with the Secretary-General. This invitation resulted in 274 actions on treaties during the three days of the Summit. A similar treaty event was supposed to be organized on the occasion of the special session on children, which had to be postponed because of the tragedy of 11 September.</div>
	<div class="p">In the light of last year's success, I should like to propose that a treaty ceremony of this kind be organized now for the sectoral anti-terrorist conventions deposited with the Secretary-General. Such an event could be held at an appropriate time during the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and I firmly believe that numerous signatures and ratifications of the conventions would contribute to their universal acceptance.</div>
	<div class="p">This statement and the above-mentioned steps undertaken by the Czech Republic reflect my country's desire and determination to play its part in concerted international efforts to eradicate international terrorism. In this connection, I call on all Member States to maintain the sense of solidarity and cooperation that united us after 11 September and to step up our efforts to liberate the world from the scourge of terrorism.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="4-2">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Fall" nation="Guinea" language="French">
	Mr. Fall (Guinea)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The tragic events that took place in the United States of America have stricken the conscience of all peace- and freedom-loving nations.</div>
	<div class="p">The Republic of Guinea would like to take this opportunity to reiterate its compassion to the people and the Government of the United States of America and to the families of the victims.</div>
	<div class="p">The unanimous stand taken by the international community following the events of 11 September 2001 show the will of States to collectively and effectively combat terrorism. Today the establishment of a concerted and coordinated strategy seems the appropriate framework to defend together the universal values of civilization.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism, one of the most dangerous scourges of our time, is the very antithesis of the values of our Organization. It violates fundamental principles of humanism and democracy and impedes the economic and social development of countries.</div>
	<div class="p">For several years now the question of terrorism has been on our Organization's agenda. Many resolutions, decisions and recommendations have been adopted to prevent it and to eliminate it in all its forms and manifestations. Due to a lack of consensus, the debate has often been bogged down because of differing and inflexible positions. These political quarrels, however, should not serve to cover up the root of an evil that affects all nations today. The tragic events of 11 September have clearly shed light for all on the serious risks posed by terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Through these acts, which have plunged more than 80 countries into mourning and have dealt a severe blow to the world economy, which was already extremely weakened, the entire international community now feels more threatened than ever. Undoubtedly that is why the General Assembly has decided to debate the question of terrorism in plenary meetings.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me to reiterate my delegation's full support for Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">resolution 1368 (2001)</a> and General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-1.pdf">resolution 56/1</a>, which attest to our collective indignation and our shared determination to eliminate the scourge down to its deepest roots.</div>
	<div class="p">For the Republic of Guinea, the phenomenon of terrorism cannot be used as a means of political pressure. To the contrary, it is a deliberate crime that, because of its cowardice and the scope of its impact, must be fought and eliminated. This is why my country is resolutely on the side of those nations determined to confront international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">My Government considers that support for international terrorism is a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and a serious threat to peace and security. In that context, it unreservedly supports <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, adopted by the Security Council on 28 September.</div>
	<div class="p">Clearly, the elimination of terrorism requires the firm determination of States to fight together against the activities that fuel it, such as the financing of terrorist acts, the recruitment on their territory of members of terrorist groups, the supply of weapons and political support. The magnitude and the complexity of the phenomenon call for the close cooperation of all States to fully eliminate it. The perpetrators and sponsors of terrorist acts must not find safe haven in any country. My delegation is convinced that these individuals must be brought to justice in accordance with the rules and procedures of international law.</div>
	<div class="p">Because of the numerous ramifications of terrorism, the international community will have to work carefully to identify those countries that are serving as bases for terrorist networks. My delegation supports the convening of a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations to draw up a response of the international community to the challenge of terrorism. My delegation welcomes the results achieved by the Ad Hoc Committee on terrorism and by the Working Group on measures to eliminate international terrorism. In this regard, we are resolutely in favour of the rapid adoption of a comprehensive convention against terrorism and the effective implementation of existing international legal instruments that deal with the war on terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">In deciding, by <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-53-22">resolution 53/22</a>, to make 2001 the United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, the General Assembly has urged us to show more tolerance and acceptance of difference in a community of interests. In that spirit, an appeal must be made to all countries for the organization of a vast campaign of education and raising the awareness of populations to warn them of and to avert the danger of terrorism. Extremism and intolerance, which are the basis for new forms of terrorism, must be banished from international practice.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation hopes that at the end of this debate, a broad consensus will emerge that will allow us, together, to take the necessary measures to combat and eliminate this new scourge, which is threatening the values of universal civilization.</div>

	Mr. Arias (Spain)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election and wish you great success.</div>
	<div class="p">Spain fully endorses the intervention of the representative of Belgium on behalf of the European Union.</div>
	<div class="p">The terrible, cowardly and inhumane terrorist attacks of 11 September have shocked the whole world. They have truly horrified the Spanish people, on whose behalf I renew our heartfelt support to the Government and the people of the United States, as well as to the people of New York, which is our home.</div>
	<div class="p">Spain has experienced the consequences of terrorism for a long time and knows very well the kind of suffering that it can inflict. Terrorism tries to overwhelm us with a dictatorship of terror and to paralyse us with fear. But against terror and fear, humanity has justice and solidarity, two noble qualities of humankind.</div>
	<div class="p">The deaths of thousands of innocent people should not be in vain. The world cannot remain passive in the face of these atrocities, which attack the most fundamental norms of civilized behaviour. We must aim at terrorist networks and at those who aid them or give them shelter, and all necessary actions must be directed at them. These measures will vary in nature and will take time.</div>
	<div class="p">Above all, such measures require joint action by the international community, for which the broadest possible coalition will be necessary. States cannot carry out this task in isolation. Whereas terrorism takes advantage of the ease of communication and freedom of movement among countries, to date we have failed to abolish the frontiers and the political and bureaucratic obstacles to international cooperation. Terrorism is a threat to us all, and we must defeat it through the cooperation of all. This coalition must include every government of the world that is genuinely interested in combating this scourge.</div>
	<div class="p">The fight against terrorism has nothing to do with an alleged clash of civilizations. To identify terrorism with a particular culture or religion would not only be a great injustice, but also a gross mistake; we would in fact be playing right into the hands of the terrorists. Combating terrorism has to do with defending the values that are shared by all the great civilizations on this planet. They are those values embodied in the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p">A global response is required by the international community against the phenomenon of terrorism. The natural place to establish such an international coalition is the United Nations. Here we can all work together. The immediate reaction of the General Assembly and the Security Council in the hours and days that followed the terrorist attacks, the adoption of Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the convening of this debate all show the Organization's determination to put its legitimacy at the service of effective international action. The Charter provides ample room to move for this purpose.</div>
	<div class="p">Our response must be commensurate with the challenge that terrorism represents. It should never imitate the contempt that terrorism displays for rules and rights. The existing instruments, with regard to both internal law and international law, must be complemented and developed to meet the challenge.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations has an important task and must rise to the occasion. This is a crucial moment for the Organization as well as for all of us, representatives of its Member States. Whoever may think, as a matter of convenience or out of delusion, that this is a problem that affects only a few countries is making a tremendous mistake. If we fail now, we will be letting down all the victims of terrorism, and we will be paving the road for equally abominable acts in the future.</div>
	<div class="p">The work of the United Nations has been made visible in the first place in the Security Council, which immediately adopted <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">resolution 1368 (2001)</a>, regarding terrorism as a threat to international peace and security and recognizing the inherent right of self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p">Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> gives legal and political strength to a series of tools for international cooperation that were previously binding only on the States parties to conventions against terrorism. Spain considers this resolution extremely important, because it is saying that the international community will not limit itself to acting against the perpetrators of such horrible recent attacks, but will also take steps to prevent such heinous acts in the future. We strongly support this resolution and are ready to cooperate towards its full and proper implementation.</div>
	<div class="p">The role of the General Assembly will be fundamental in this effort. The Assembly's declarations of 1994 and 1996 on measures to eliminate international terrorism paved the way. Resolution 56/1 was a sound response to the attacks on 11 September.</div>
	<div class="p">We must expedite signature, ratification and adhesion for the 12 conventions against terrorism that have been adopted in the framework of the United Nations. Spain has signed all 12 and has ratified 11. We will shortly be able to communicate the ratification of the one dealing with the suppression of the financing of terrorism. It is of the utmost importance to provide the executive and judicial institutions of our States with universally accepted and applied standards regarding terrorism. For that it is essential that those conventions that are in force be as widely supported as possible and that they be fully implemented.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly must also request the Sixth Committee to successfully finalize the negotiations on the general convention against terrorism and the convention on nuclear terrorism. Spain is determined to work intensively in the Assembly in order to conclude those negotiations. We attach great importance to provisions rejecting any justification of terrorism on political or other grounds, and to the need to prevent the use of asylum as a cover for terrorist activities.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, Spain believes that the convening of a high-level international conference against terrorism could contribute to strengthening international commitment to fight terrorism, provided that it is properly planned. In order to do that, it would be necessary to reach consensus on the terms of such a meeting prior to its holding.</div>
	<div class="p">Likewise, regional cooperation must be strengthened in this area. The European Union is already taking steps in that direction, and the conclusions of the European Council meeting held on 21 September are a good example. We trust that other regions of the world will also make similar progress.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is a serious threat to democracy and freedom. It would be ominous to remain passive before such a threat. We must be able to place international cooperation against terrorism on a substantially different plane. Basically, that means a change in political culture. We have moved from viewing terrorism as an undesirable phenomenon, but one which we did not know how to defeat, to deciding that we are going to mobilize all our energies to eradicate it from our lives.</div>
	<div class="p">I can assure the Assembly that my country shall continue to be at the forefront of this effort so that this session of the General Assembly may be remembered as the one that gave birth to a coalition against terrorism, one of the greatest challenges facing the world at the beginning of the twenty-first century.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Ms. Jarbussynova" nation="Kazakhstan" language="">
	Ms. Jarbussynova (Kazakhstan)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The unbelievable acts of violence committed in the United States on 11 September deeply shocked people all over the world. Kazakhstan joined other countries in firmly condemning those barbaric and criminal acts of terrorism, which took the lives of thousands of innocent people and caused considerable material damage. President Nursultan Nazarbaev conveyed deep condolences to President George Bush and expressed profound sympathy to the Government and people of the United States of America.</div>
	<div class="p">What happened in the United States was a crime against humanity, an act of horrendous violence against all nations and creeds. We are confident that the international efforts will help to find the authors and perpetrators of those inhuman terrorist attacks and bring them to justice for their crimes. It is essential that the response should not only be effective, but also just. We welcome the intention of the Government of the United States to produce evidence before any military strike.</div>
	<div class="p">In that respect, we should not condemn the people of Afghanistan for the terrorist attacks, as we must not condemn Muslims and Arabs -- the vast majority of whom do not support religious extremism. As actions are taken against terrorists and their sponsors, we must make sure that the lives of thousands of women and girls in Afghanistan, who have suffered so terribly under the rule of the Taliban, are saved and that their plight not be forgotten. Afghanistan's women and girls should be at the centre of the rebirth of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. They must finally gain their freedom and full rights and get access to education and health care.</div>
	<div class="p">Alarmed by the severe situation in Afghanistan, the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbaev, expressed during his address to the Millennium Summit last year his deep concern at the growing threat emanating from the conflict in Afghanistan to the stability and security of Central Asia. He called for a special meeting of the Security Council to adopt large-scale and comprehensive measures to settle the situation in Afghanistan. We believe that new approaches to the assessment of the current political, military and geopolitical situation in the region and the elaboration by the United Nations of an essentially new concept for a settlement in Afghanistan could help to bring long-awaited peace and stability to the suffering Afghan people.</div>
	<div class="p">The recent tragedy in the United States has demonstrated how vulnerable we are to insidious and unexpected terrorist acts. The tragic events force the international community to reconsider its measures to eliminate this extremely dangerous phenomenon. This issue should be addressed globally by strengthening international cooperation to combat terrorism in all its forms. Kazakhstan has always spoken out against terrorism and is ready to participate in the establishment of an effective international coalition of countries to combat international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">In the light of the recent events, Kazakhstan is reviewing international instruments on terrorism with a view to becoming party to them. We are in the process of ratifying the 1997 International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">This November, the Government of Kazakhstan will host a meeting of member States of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia, during which the heads of State and Government are expected to sign the Almaty act, the final document of that regional forum. The Almaty act unconditionally and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as well as any support or acquiescence to it or the failure to condemn it directly.</div>
	<div class="p">That document also declares the determination of the member States of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia to cooperate on a bilateral and multilateral basis to combat terrorism, including its possible sources. The participants in the process will unite their efforts not to allow terrorism in any form to be planned, assisted or financed from the territory of any State, or to provide terrorists with safe haven and protection. The confidence-building measures will contribute significantly to the efforts of the international community to ensure global and regional security and play a significant role in combating international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">During the second half of the last century, international terrorism became a dangerous phenomenon threatening international peace and security. Accordingly, countries found themselves obliged to develop legal instruments to combat it. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization -- comprised of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan -- has adopted the Shanghai Convention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism. The member States have clearly indicated that opposing terrorism, extremism and separatism is one of the most important objectives of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and they are ready to take effective measures, in close cooperation with all States and international organizations, to wage an uncompromising struggle to root out the global threat of terrorism. Measures are also being taken to hasten the establishment of a regional anti-terrorist structure.</div>
	<div class="p">As I mentioned already, terrorism represents a major threat to international peace and security. It knows neither international nor moral boundaries. But the international community should also expose the forces that create poverty, intolerance, hatred and environmental degradation, which lead to instability in the world. These negative factors can fan the flames of hate and ignite the belief that terrorism is the only solution to a community's or a nation's ills. When people are denied access to clean water, soil and air to meet their basic human needs, we see the rise of poverty, ill health and a sense of hopelessness. Desperate people can resort to desperate solutions. They may care little about themselves and the people they hurt.</div>
	<div class="p">The rise of globalization and its impacts on global trade patterns is also a key issue that the international community must face up to. We cannot be for or against globalization. It is simply a fact of the modern world, and we cannot ignore it. But we need a just and fair system that will bring sustainable economic benefits to rich and poor countries alike. Without this, the forces that forge civil unrest and that, in the extreme, can give rise to terrorism will continue to flourish everywhere.</div>
	<div class="p">A great deal remains to be done by the international community to eliminate terrorism. This global problem could be resolved by intensifying the work of the Security Council and increasing its efforts to prevent and combat this dangerous phenomenon. That principal body of the United Nations, which is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, should play a leading role in that direction. It must respond with a greater commitment to take all appropriate action to formulate a global strategy against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">This week's plenary meetings are an important opportunity for the General Assembly to reaffirm its strong commitment to combating international terrorism. My country attaches the utmost importance to the prevention and suppression of terrorism, and continues actively to participate in the efforts of the United Nations in that field.</div>

	<div class="p">It has been barely three weeks since the terrible 11 September terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, in which more than 6,000 innocent Americans and people from almost 80 other countries lost their lives, and in which more than 8,000 people were wounded. Most of the world experienced the indescribable horror of seeing planeloads of innocent human beings crash into buildings filled with thousands of other innocent human beings. They experienced the sheer terror of watching people jump from the upper floors of the collapsing World Trade Center to avoid being burned alive inside.</div>
	<div class="p">Having suffered more than two decades of war and terrorist acts, the people and the Government of Cambodia understand very well how deeply the people of the United States felt the disaster's severity and agony for those they love in these tragic circumstances. Their pain is ours. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate once again the heartfelt condolences of the Government and the people of Cambodia to the Government and the people of the United States, and to those of all other nations that lost citizens in these heinous terrorist acts.</div>
	<div class="p">We are gathered today to discuss terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with a view to strengthening international cooperation to combat that scourge. Without meaning to diminish the anguish and sorrow of the families of the victims and of all others affected by the recent attacks, I ask members to reflect for a moment on the hundreds of millions of victims of acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations all over the world which has afflicted mankind throughout its history.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is defined as the sustained, clandestine use of violence, murder, kidnapping and bombing to achieve a political purpose. It has prevailed throughout history: through the horrors and suffering of colonialism, through the subversion of entire countries and peoples, and throughout the cold war. Terrorism cuts across national borders; although Governments are often the targets, it is more often innocent civilians who are its victims. Public and private property too is destroyed.</div>
	<div class="p">The difference today is that through ever more powerful globalization, enabled by advances in information and communications technology, nobody and no country in the world -- with no distinction between the rich and the poor, the powerful and the powerless, between a super-Power and a little speck in the ocean -- is safe from terrorism. When death strikes, we are all the same.</div>
	<div class="p">Before all else, that black Tuesday's mass murder must be condemned in the harshest possible terms without qualification or conditions. The demented, suicidal fury of the attackers resulted in heinous acts of indiscriminate and wholesale murder that have changed the world for the worse. A moral stand must begin with unequivocal condemnation, the absence of which could eliminate even the language by which people can communicate.</div>
	<div class="p">We must analyse the causes of the tragedy; that is essential also if we are to find solutions to the all-encompassing horror of terrorism. No suicidal "terrorist gene" is known to exist or is ever likely to be found. Therefore, surely the attackers and their supporters, who were all presumably born normal, were afflicted by something that caused their metamorphosis from normal human beings, capable of gentleness and affection, into desperate and fiendish beings with nothing but murder in their hearts and minds. What happened? We must all engage in collective and honest soul-searching to find the answer. For only through an understanding of the underlying causes can we effectively fight terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">This month, Cambodia is celebrating the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Paris peace agreements. I am pleased to say that we have come a long way since that auspicious day. Following the collapse of the Khmer Rouge in 1996 and the fair and free elections of 1998, peace and stability prevail throughout the country for the first time after many decades of war and suffering. The Government and the people of Cambodia are determined to rebuild the country in the mould of democracy, respect for human rights and economic and social development. Our war now is a war against poverty. All this, however, has not entirely solved the problem of terrorism. In November 2000, Cambodia was attacked by a terrorist group calling itself the Cambodian Freedom Fighters, which caused extensive harm to innocent civilians as well as damage to public and private property. Its activities are terrorist acts and not anti-Government acts; they are aimed at destabilizing peace and security in the country and overthrowing the legal Government elected by the people of Cambodia. Today, Cambodia still continues to face terrorist threats from that group, which is masterminded by Cambodians in exile, who live abroad in comfort and with total impunity.</div>
	<div class="p">At this juncture, I would like to recall that definitions in the United States Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the United Kingdom Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1976 clearly underline the use of violence to coerce or intimidate the civilian population in order to bring about changes in Government policy.</div>
	<div class="p">On behalf of the people and the Government of Cambodia, I should like to appeal to the countries involved, in a spirit of respect for the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, of the General Assembly and of international law, to refrain from supporting or tolerating the activities of the terrorist group known as the Cambodian Freedom Fighters, which is trying to commit terrorist acts against the Cambodian people. Regardless of their motivations, the perpetrators must be condemned, prosecuted and punished.</div>
	<div class="p">Cambodia endured more than its share of collective suffering during the cold-war period. We feel solidarity with the people of Afghanistan. For decades they, too, have suffered. Their schools, their hospitals, their houses, their infrastructure -- everything has been destroyed. They have been cut off from medicines and from health care, and now, following the events of 11 September, the United Nations is warning us of the danger of a humanitarian catastrophe of unbelievable proportions. We must recall this when we speak of eradicating terrorism. We are fully in favour of the elimination of terrorism throughout the world, and in particular of the masterminds of the horrendous terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But we must do so without inflicting more suffering on, or sowing more death among, the people of Afghanistan.</div>
	<div class="p">Allow me to associate myself with the other speakers in emphasizing that the tragic events of 11 September have not discouraged any of us. Quite the contrary; they have further enhanced our strength and our solidarity and intensified our will to combat these terrorist acts against humanity. The Prime Minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia, Mr. Hun Sen, expressed his support for the military campaign waged by the United States of America against terrorists. He also appealed for the safety of civilians to be safeguarded.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">He also recently declared that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The whole world must unite its efforts and undertake joint action to fight against terrorism."</div>
	<div class="p">It is in that spirit that we fully support the efforts under way under the auspices of the United Nations to forge a global coalition against terrorism, as we have been called upon to do by our Secretary-General, Kofi Annan.</div>
	<div class="p">The Security Council, the day after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, adopted <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">resolution 1368 (2001)</a>, which vigorously condemned those attacks. In addition, last Friday, a resolution of considerable scope -- <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> -- containing measures and strategies to combat international terrorism, was also adopted unanimously. Those resolutions supplement <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1269-1999">resolution 1269 (1999)</a>, which unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">We are here today to devise specific measures to back these resolutions. There are already 12 conventions that deal with the various aspects of terrorism. The most recent one was adopted during the most recent session of the General Assembly to combat the financing of terrorism. There are also two initiatives in the Sixth Committee and in the General Assembly: one proposed by India and the other by Russia. We fully support India's initiative to consolidate those 12 Conventions into one single convention that would then be implemented by the international community.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Petric" nation="Slovenia" language="">
	Mr. Petric (Slovenia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I deem it most appropriate, since we are deliberating on measures to prevent and eradicate terrorism, to again express Slovenia's deepest sorrow and condolences to the people of the United States of America, and in particular to the city of New York, for the tragic and horrific terrorist attack that occurred on 11 September. This horrible crime has brought us together today, here in the General Assembly, to express our firm devotion and political will to eradicate terrorism, which three weeks ago struck New York but could, unless prevented in time, strike our capitals too. Indeed, we are morally bound to the thousands of victims of terrorism to put the fight against terrorism at the top of our agenda.</div>
	<div class="p">Slovenia has aligned itself with the statement of the representative of Belgium on behalf of the European Union and associated countries. We agree with the conclusions and other planned activities of the European Union as well as the plan of action that was adopted by the European Council at its extraordinary session on 21 September.</div>
	<div class="p">Slovenia strongly condemns all acts of terrorism, regardless of who the perpetrators are or what their declared aim may be. Terrorism is always -- I repeat, always -- criminal and unjustifiable, because it deliberately and indiscriminately attacks those who are most vulnerable: the civilian population. There can be no justification whatsoever for such attacks.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism abhors dialogue and has no respect for the lives of others, not even for the lives of women and children. It thrives on fear and hatred, and preys on ignorance and prejudice. While often Governments can be the targets, in most cases civilians are the victims -- civilians of any country, creed or colour, as the crime committed on 11 September proves. Innocent citizens from more than 80 countries were injured or killed, and property -- both private and public -- was damaged or destroyed.</div>
	<div class="p">International terrorism has many manifestations and many sources. It is a threat to the international community as a whole; no country in any part of the world can feel free of the scourge of terrorist crimes. International terrorism has become a serious threat to Governments, and especially to individuals. Terrorist attacks most often take place on an international scale, so international cooperation and coordinated efforts are essential elements in combating international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Global action to prevent and suppress terrorist acts requires cooperation among States and among various international and regional organizations, especially through exchange of information, mutual legal assistance and cooperation among police and intelligence forces. The criminal and international nature of terrorist acts demands the prosecution and punishment of their perpetrators in all countries, by all legal systems. That is a clear obligation of States under international law and is now confirmed by Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. International cooperation in prosecuting terrorists is our common obligation.</div>
	<div class="p">It is, of course, very important to understand, address and eradicate the long-term roots of terrorism. It is necessary to understand the political, economic, philosophical, ideological and even religious roots of terrorism. But the search for the root causes of terrorism should in no way hinder our joint action and our strict fulfilment of Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">After what happened on 11 September, we do not need to wait to have a precise and comprehensive definition of terrorism. Crimes such as those committed on that infamous day are simply horrible, heinous crimes against innocent people, against humanity, against all religions. They are simply crimes against us all, no matter what the motivations behind them.</div>
	<div class="p">New terrorist threats are emerging. The Internet, the global communications systems and new technologies in general are easily accessible and can be used for such terrorist purposes as well. The enormous financial gains from illicit trafficking and transactions, as well as the abundant availability of weapons, from small arms to the more sophisticated ones, might create even more dangerous types of terrorism. The use of chemical and biological weapons and weapons of mass destruction by terrorists remains acute. States must be ever more vigilant and should cooperate closely to deny access to such materials and delivery systems to the terrorists.</div>
	<div class="p">Since 1972, when the problem of international terrorism was first brought before the General Assembly, the international community has worked continuously, though maybe not vigorously enough, on measures to combat international terrorism. Over the years, we have nevertheless created a network of international legal instruments aimed at combating terrorism, on both the universal and regional scales. Specific crimes require specific treatment and the availability of various legal instruments makes possible the degree of diversification necessary to ensure the legal and practical effectiveness of each relevant legal instruments. Slovenia has succeeded or acceded to a number of international conventions; to those which deal specifically with unlawful acts against the safety of aircraft; to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents; to the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials; and to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, to mention just a few.</div>
	<div class="p">The delegation of Slovenia participates in all meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a>, endeavouring to draft a comprehensive convention on combating international terrorism. We are all aware of the problems so well highlighted by the Legal Counsel, Mr. Corell, at the meeting of the Security Council on 21 September. Nevertheless, we believe that decisive progress should and could now be made.</div>
	<div class="p">As for the relationship between the comprehensive convention and the sectoral conventions, we believe that we should preserve mechanisms already created by the partial conventions without, however, undermining the mechanisms that might be established by the comprehensive convention. Both mechanisms could be applied simultaneously if an effective relationship were established, and we believe that it can be established. Slovenia hopes that the work of the Ad Hoc Committee will proceed successfully at its coming session and is ready and willing to contribute to it.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me conclude by stressing once again Slovenia's firm condemnation of all acts of terrorism, no matter what the so-called purpose or who the perpetrators might be. The cooperation of the international community as a whole is essential to fighting terrorism in all its aspects and manifestations. If we want to secure a better world, free of terrorism, and to protect effectively our citizens, our freedoms, our values and our goods, we have to cooperate; we have to put the United Nations, our Organization, at the centre of endeavours to eradicate terrorism and its roots: hatred, fanaticism, discrimination, poverty and all kinds of injustices.</div>
	<div class="p">Slovenia strongly supports Security Council resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">1368 (2001)</a> and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">1373 (2001)</a>. By these resolutions, all Members of the United Nations -- all of us -- are obliged, legally bound according to the Charter, to unite our endeavours against terrorists and terrorism. There should be no hesitation, no excuse -- we are simply bound to comply in good faith with resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">1368 (2001)</a> and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">1373 (2001)</a>. We are bound by deeds, not only by verbal declarations, to stop terrorists and terrorism.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="11-6">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Hussein" nation="Ethiopia" language="">
	Mr. Hussein (Ethiopia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">At the outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Han on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.</div>
	<div class="p">In Ethiopia, 11 September has for centuries been marked as the beginning of the new year. Three weeks ago, with the shocking, devastating and criminal terrorist acts committed in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, thousands of innocent lives were lost and millions all over the United States and the world mourned. For us in Ethiopia, it was no longer the usual 11 September of yesteryears. With the crime committed at the World Trade Center, in our host city, a red line has been crossed by international terrorists. The attack was not only against the people of the United States, but -- as many here have said -- against all of humanity. New York, as host to the United Nations, is indeed the political capital of the world. Hence, never before have terrorists mortally hit all nations at the same time, as happened at the World Trade Center buildings on 11 September.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to reiterate here Ethiopia's strong condemnation of those who planned and carried out these acts, which fill us with revulsion. My country once again expresses its deepest-felt condolences to the people and Government of the United States. Our sympathies also goes to the bereaved families in the more than 80 countries, including Ethiopia, whose citizens also perished in the evil attacks. During his address to this Assembly on Monday, Mayor Giuliani asked each of us -- as I am sure we all remember -- if he could tell the families of the victims whether they have our support. I say to the Mayor and to the families of the victims: you do indeed have Ethiopia's full support.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is multifaceted. It therefore demands extraordinary collaboration among States to combat the danger it presents. Terrorism is the use of violence or the threat of violence to create a climate of fear in a given population. This it does by maiming and killing indiscriminately. We must not allow the climate of fear to overcome us. The people and the leaders of New York City have shown that they have not succumbed to the barbarism visited upon them.</div>
	<div class="p">As someone who has survived three terrorist attacks, I can say that I have come out of it, with God's help, the stronger. Certainly, it has only increased my own determination that we should defeat international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">All countries must declare that terrorism in whatever form is unjustifiable. I fully agree with my Slovenian colleague, who said this in almost exactly the same words. Those who propagate or condone the pursuit of political objectives by terrorist means must be told unequivocally that it is unacceptable.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">The Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has said:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"All nations of the world must be united ... in their determination to take action ... both against the terrorists themselves and against all those who give them any kind of shelter, assistance or encouragement." (<i><a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-PV.1">A/56/PV.1</a></i>)</div>
	<div class="p">My Government fully agrees with the Secretary-General. The people and the Government of Ethiopia have, over the past 10 years in particular, been at the forefront in the fight against terrorism. Our capital city and other towns, as well as specific border areas, have been subjected to terrorist attacks.</div>
	<div class="p">If we look back in history, we find that the first hijacking of a commercial airliner was that of an Ethiopian Airlines aeroplane in the mid-1960s. That led Ethiopia to take serious security measures, including the use of air marshals. As a victim of and a pioneer in the struggle against terrorism, we wholeheartedly support all struggles against terrorism, whether in Ethiopia, in our subregion or at the global level. To fight this scourge of humanity, countries must share intelligence and improve and coordinate security arrangements both within and along their borders.</div>
	<div class="p">The Ethiopian Government, for its part, has taken various legislative and administrative measures aimed at combating terrorism -- among them the tightening of border security, stringent immigration rules and airport safety provisions. At the regional level, Ethiopia has been one of the major driving forces behind the adoption of the Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism. Internationally, Ethiopia has signed and acceded to a number of sectoral conventions and treaties pertaining to terrorism. In this spirit, we welcome and fully support Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">Cooperation among States in the fight against terrorism must be based on international law and on the maximum participation of States Members of this Organization. The international community must arm itself with clear and effective instruments which respect human rights and at the same time address the political and economic problems serving as factors of instability, which terrorist groups take advantage of. Serious thought must be given to questions underlying the vast disparities in development between North and South. Specifically, the problems of poverty as a potential breeding ground for terrorism must not be overlooked. The early adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism must therefore be a major priority for all of us. In this context, my delegation supports the draft submitted by India to the Sixth Committee as a basis for arriving at such a convention. It is important to show flexibility and political will so that work on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism can be completed thus closing the existing gaps in the legal regime for combating terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">As many previous speakers have stated, terrorism is not associated with any particular religion, race or, for that matter, civilization. In the fight against terrorism, we should not allow ourselves to be carried away into our own narrow corners of ignorance and bigotry. Those who pose questions of superiority of one civilization over another, while forgetting their own recent negative history, reduce the capacity of the international community to build a strong and meaningful coalition against terrorism. Whether they know it or not, utterances by such individuals will only help terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, my delegation would like to reiterate two points.</div>
	<div class="p">First, there is an urgent need for an agreement on a comprehensive convention to fight international terrorism. While it is important to have a precise legal definition of terrorism, I agree with Mr. Kofi Annan that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"There can be no acceptance of those who would seek to justify the deliberate taking of innocent civilian life, regardless of cause or grievance." (<i><a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-PV.12">A/56/PV.12</a></i>)</div>
	<div class="p">Surely the peoples of the world whom we represent here will not understand or forgive us if we fail to quickly arrive at an agreed comprehensive convention because some of us may descend to being pedantic. I hope that that will not happen.</div>
	<div class="p">Secondly, it is important and fitting that the Untied Nations should act as the focal forum for combating international terrorism. However, it must also not be forgotten that if and when terrorists do attack a country, as happened on 11 September, that country has the legitimate right to defend itself. Furthermore, it has an obligation to its people to seek out those who planned, funded, encouraged and harboured the terrorists, and to hold them accountable.</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="13-6">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Al-Hussein" nation="Jordan" language="Arabic">
	Mr. Al-Hussein (Jordan)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I congratulate Mr. Han on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I am confident that his experience and wisdom will ensure the success of the work of this session and of our discussions, which we hope will benefit the international community as a whole. I also extend my thanks and appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his outstanding efforts in guiding the previous General Assembly session to such success.</div>
	<div class="p">I would also like, on behalf of the King and the people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, to extend my sincere condolences to the people and the Government of the United States of America over the great loss of innocent civilian life and the material damage resulting from the terrorist attacks that targeted official and civilian American institutions.</div>
	<div class="p">Jordan once again reaffirms its unchanging and long-standing rejection of terrorism in all its forms and, in particular, condemns in the strongest terms the incidents in Washington D.C., New York and Pennsylvania. I stress that we will support the United States and stand ready to provide any assistance necessary to deal with this situation.</div>
	<div class="p">The long-standing Jordanian position is based on the idea that terrorism in all its forms is a crime against humanity and a threat to international peace and security, and that terrorism is one of the major reasons for conflicts in the world and an incitement to hatred between peoples. Jordan considers these crimes to be an aggression against the fundamental human rights to life, security, progress and prosperity, and an aggression against the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Terrorism serves no legitimate purpose. On the contrary, it leads to depriving rightful owners of the legal means of obtaining their rights in accordance with international law. In this respect, we must distinguish between the right of people to self-determination and to resist foreign occupation on the one hand, and, on the other, blind terrorism, which targets innocent people.</div>
	<div class="p">Jordan appeals to everyone not to confuse terrorist activities with Arab culture and the Islamic religious law of shariah, which prohibits the harming of civilians, even in wartime, and which calls for tolerance, justice, peace and the rejection of injustice and aggression. Many of the norms of international and humanitarian laws found in the principles of the Hague Conventions and the four Geneva Conventions were prescribed by the Islamic shariah more than 14 centuries ago.</div>
	<div class="p">The peoples of the world, including Arab and Muslim people, have not escaped the evil scourge of terrorism, which has led to many innocent civilians being killed. Therefore, it is important that we consolidate international efforts to work collectively in a comprehensive framework to combat terrorism in all its forms, particularly since the danger of the phenomenon of terrorism is not limited to a specific State, or just one part of the world; terrorism's impact extends to harming the whole international community, without exception.</div>
	<div class="p">We have to fight terrorism in all its aspects, such as instigation to terrorism and sources of financing and training. In this regard, the Jordanian Government has taken many national measures to combat terrorism, from which Jordan has often suffered as a result of difficult political regional and international conditions. On the national level, requisite punitive legislation was enacted to punish all forms of terrorist activities, bring perpetrators to justice and suppress the financing of such acts. Jordanian banking regulations safeguard the transparency of all financial transactions so that we can detect and track all suspect sources of financing and prevent them from being used for illegal purposes. In addition, the Jordanian Government works tirelessly to prevent terrorist acts before they occur.</div>
	<div class="p">At the regional and international levels, Jordan cooperates with many other countries to prevent and suppress terrorist crimes. Jordan has concluded many bilateral and international agreements to cooperate in judicial matters. It has also signed or ratified 11 international and regional conventions and agreements to combat terrorism. The last of these was the Arab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, in 1998, and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, in 1999.</div>
	<div class="p">Jordan ceaselessly cooperates with various countries and relevant international organizations to take effective legal measures to protect human life and property, as well as to prosecute anyone who attacks them. Jordan will continue to pursue all these endeavours in cooperation with many other countries in order to put an end to the phenomenon of terrorism, which imperils international peace and security and causes suffering for all peoples.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with this position, and on the basis of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Jordan expresses its support for the United Nations resolutions aimed at eradicating the phenomenon of terrorism. The last of these was Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, adopted on 28 September, calling on all countries to cooperate with each other and with the Security Council to achieve the objectives of the resolution and implement its d provisions.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="14-5">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Boisson" nation="Monaco" language="French">
	Mr. Boisson (Monaco)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On 11 September, disbelief gave way to horror in the face of the unprecedented violence and magnitude of the terrorist attacks against the United States of America.</div>
	<div class="p">His Serene Highness the Sovereign Prince of Monaco immediately conveyed his condolences to President Bush and assured him of the solidarity of his Government and all the citizens of Monaco. Allow me, in these terrible circumstances, to reiterate to the authorities and people of the United States the compassion and solidarity of the authorities and people of the Principality. We also convey our most profound sympathy to all those, the nationals of more than 80 nations, affected by these barbarous acts.</div>
	<div class="p">My country felt that it itself had been struck to its foundations, as did all States whose institutions rest on democratic principles, respect for the human person and the rule of law, values upon which our societies are based, as is the international community gathered at the United Nations. Its commitment to defending those values is therefore absolute.</div>
	<div class="p">In this spirit, the United Nations immediately and unequivocally condemned on 12 September those unjustifiable criminal acts, in the first resolution to be adopted at the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, which stresses that the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of those acts will have to answer for them, while the Security Council took similar action by adopting <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">resolution 1368 (2001)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">The Principality of Monaco fully adheres to the terms of those resolutions and to the terms of all other Security Council and General Assembly resolutions condemning acts of terrorism, which represent a threat to international peace and security. We particularly recall Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1333-2000">resolution 1333 (2000)</a> of 19 December 2000, which invoked Chapter VII of the Charter expressly in regard to the Taliban.</div>
	<div class="p">In order to preserve our common principles, as stated in the Charter, while protecting the peoples from this now worldwide scourge of terrorism, the Principality's Government believes that we must commit ourselves in a spirit of solidarity to supporting and strengthening the work of the Ad Hoc Committee created in 1996 by <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a>. Thanks to the work of that Committee, our Assembly was able to adopt the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings in 1997 and, in December 1999, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The political will of the Principality of Monaco was reflected in particular by its ratification of the former on 6 September 2001 and by the firm intention demonstrated on several occasions to sign the latter before the end of this year. On behalf of the highest authorities of the Principality, I solemnly reiterate this commitment here. In addition, I would like to point out that the Principality of Monaco will very soon deposit its instrument of accession to the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages.</div>
	<div class="p">My country is party to the conventions of the International Civil Aviation Organization concerning the safety of aviation, in particular the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation. It is also a party to the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection.</div>
	<div class="p">The Government of Monaco is convinced that strengthening the international legal order is one of the cornerstones for intergovernmental action to combat and eliminate international terrorism in all of its forms and manifestations, regardless of where such acts may be committed or who the perpetrators may be. We are convinced that the diligence of the international community will be decisive for the completion of the draft convention on the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism and the draft general convention on international terrorism. The delegation of Monaco will also associate itself with the efforts under way that should enable us, based on experience, rapidly to complement the already existing arsenal of legal instruments.</div>
	<div class="p">In facing universal crimes such as those we have recently witnessed, the response can only be a wholly universal one. The United Nations, as the Secretary-General rightly recalled, must therefore be the central element for international cooperation to combat the crime of terrorism. We unreservedly share this view.</div>
	<div class="p">In dealing with networks that can so easily and effectively use the world banking system, international cooperation to combat transnational organized crime and the criminal use of the international financial system must be strengthened, and very quickly so. The Principality of Monaco was among the first States to sign and ratify the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. It is also party to the first two Protocols to this Convention that must play a basic role in the struggle against all types of criminal networks involving persons or groups installed simultaneously in various countries.</div>
	<div class="p">My country, which is not yet a member of the Council of Europe, has, inter alia, requested the Council of Ministers of that organization to allow it to become a party to the European convention dealing with money-laundering and the detection, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime. It hopes to obtain a favourable response to its request as soon as possible.</div>
	<div class="p">The Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, has, through <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, provided a strong new impetus to the war against the financing of terrorism. The creation of a Committee designed to follow up the implementation of the provisions of that resolution and the request made to Member States to report to it the measures that they take within a 90-day period are evidence of the strong political will that we will have to maintain until this scourge it totally eliminated.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to emphasize that Monaco is in a position, based on its commitment to existing conventions, to take measures immediately on its territory to satisfy the demands of the Security Council and those of the United States regarding the freezing of the assets of individuals and groups. The appropriate instructions have already been given to banking institutions, while at the same time steps have been taken to strengthen the legal and normative basis of existing national legislation for the suppression of acts of terrorism and associated activities.</div>
	<div class="p">Monaco's information and monitoring service for the financial system is working in close cooperation with its European and American counterparts, and with all the necessary determination in order to help deprive terrorist groups and those who support them of financing.</div>
	<div class="p">With the assistance of the International Criminal Police Organization in particular, the police and legal authorities of Monaco are now engaged in carrying out the necessary investigations. A list of names of persons drawn up by the American authorities is the subject of detailed and in-depth study, and the Monaco Bank Association has been dealing appropriately with the situation. Any indication of the presence in Monaco of such individuals, property, or assets would immediately give rise to legal proceedings.</div>
	<div class="p">The recent events have led the authorities in Monaco to plan to expand, speed up and increase the effectiveness of all services that could, directly or indirectly, deal with activities concerning terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community must henceforth demonstrate its unflinching determination and a new and genuine solidarity so that justice can be done, and so that human tragedies as immense as the one we have just experienced cannot be repeated. By adopting the Millennium Declaration, our Heads of State and Government made commitments to that end and set objectives. More than ever before, let us act together to advance the cause of peace and security throughout the world, the fundamental mission of our Organization, and act on these commitments that they have given pride of place.</div>
	<div class="p">The Principality of Monaco, fully aware of the importance of this imperative, is ready, I can assure the Assembly, to share it unequivocally with all Member States.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p"></i>I wish first of all to express my sincere condolences and compassion to the people of the United States for the tragedy that afflicted them last week. I also wish to express our solidarity to the families of the victims of all countries, whose nationals are still missing after the atrocious terrorist act.</div>
	<div class="p">Today we are discussing the specific role to be played by the United Nations in confronting the threat of international terrorism. Indeed, it has seldom been the case that so many have raised their voices in horror and suffering at the terrible acts committed on 11 September. Therefore, this consensus should help us to better target this scourge.</div>
	<div class="p">Andorra has been characterized by seven centuries of peace and by economic and social development that has benefited all its inhabitants. This well-being makes us all the more aware of the present situation and compels us to direct our efforts towards a strategy to eradicate this scourge. We are undoubtedly confronting a unique type of conflict because of its scope and nature. Therefore, we must reflect and act to guarantee freedom and security for our citizens.</div>
	<div class="p">What can the United Nations do? This question has been repeatedly asked during the last few days, and we have all been asked about the role our Organization can play starting now. As it was said last week at the debate on the Secretary-General's report, we have to be able to recreate our work, because part of our credibility will depend on the ability to do that.</div>
	<div class="p">Over the sessions of the past few years, particularly in the Sixth Committee, the concept of international terrorism has been analysed and debated. International instruments of prevention and suppression of terrorism have been drawn up, and the need to create other conventions that will protect us from this threat continue to be considered. This task must be a priority on our agenda.</div>
	<div class="p">Andorra condemns terrorism in all its aspects and fights it with unambiguous domestic legislation, particularly in the area of money-laundering. Further, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has given instructions to initiate, with the greatest priority and timeliness, the examination of international instruments to combat terrorism, which must be one of the pillars of our joint work.</div>
	<div class="p">We appeal to the international community from this rostrum to act in coordination in all these areas because it is the sum of our efforts that will lead to the desired results. We welcome Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> because it is a great step towards achieving the ultimate goal.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I would like to say that the task before us will be long and difficult, but if the United Nations wishes to continue being a forum of discussion for peace and the progress of peoples, then it must assume this responsibility.</div>

	Mr. Dos Santos (Mozambique)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me to begin by joining previous speakers in congratulating the President on his election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that under his wise and skilful leadership our work will be crowned with success. He may rest assured that my delegation will collaborate and cooperate with him.</div>
	<div class="p">The President of the Republic of Mozambique, on behalf of the people and Government of Mozambique, has expressed, and we reiterate, our profound sympathy and condolences to the Government and people of the United States of America for the tragic events of 11 September. Our sentiments are also extended to the representatives of those nations that lost their citizens and to all bereaved families. We share their pain and sorrow.</div>
	<div class="p">I also want to reiterate my Government's unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11 September. These abominable and senseless acts are criminal and unjustifiable under any circumstances.</div>
	<div class="p">We pay tribute to all those involved in rescue operations and those giving invaluable support to the victims.</div>
	<div class="p">We are gathered here in solidarity, as the United Nations, to reaffirm our commitment and dedication to the principles and purposes enshrined in the Charter and to act in their defence.</div>
	<div class="p">As reflected in the report of the Secretary-General before us, international terrorism has always been recognized and reflected in the contemporary principles of international law and other relevant rules of international law as a scourge that all nations must combat as part of their international obligations.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations has been and remains central to international efforts to combat terrorism. The 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism and its 1996 Supplement constitute a landmark in the concerted international efforts to combat terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Disturbed by the increase of acts of international terrorism in its different forms and manifestations in many regions of the world and recognizing terrorism as a threat to international peace and security, the General Assembly has decided to launch a new international fight against terrorism by calling for a strengthening of international cooperation and progressive development of international law and its codification.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, we welcome the work done by the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a> and that done by the working group of the Sixth Committee on developing a more comprehensive legal framework for the prevention and suppression of international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">As a result of the work done by the Ad Hoc Committee and by the working group of the Sixth Committee, the General Assembly adopted, in 1997, the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and, in 1999, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which represent concrete achievements in the implementation of the 1994 Declaration and its 1996 supplement.</div>
	<div class="p">The Ad Hoc Committee and the working group of the Sixth Committee are also elaborating a comprehensive convention on international terrorism and an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. We want to take this opportunity to thank the delegation of India for the initiative to present for negotiation a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism, and we call for a speedy completion of this convention of fundamental importance. We also call for further efforts to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the completion of the international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">It is vital that all United Nations Member States work towards signing and ratifying the 12 conventions and protocols already adopted, for they represent the legal foundations upon which we can build our collective action against terrorism. In this context, the proposal by the Non-Aligned Movement calling for an international high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations is an important and useful initiative that must be finalized to formulate a joint, organized response to international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism knows no boundaries and no permanent or defined targets. Not so long ago, some countries in our region experienced tragedies provoked by terrorist acts. The terrorist bombings of 1998 in Kenya and Tanzania are clear examples of the nature of terrorism and its total disregard for the life of innocent and defenceless people regardless of their geographical location, race, religious belief or political orientation. These events and many others elsewhere in the world, including those of 11 September, have proved that only concerted international action can prevent such tragedies.</div>
	<div class="p">All States must work together in a coordinated manner to prevent the use of their territories by terrorists. They must also prevent the financing, training, instigation and organization of terrorists by any party whatsoever, regardless of any political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other considerations that may be invoked to justify their acts.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community must reinforce its resolve to face the challenge of eliminating the scourge of terrorism once for all. The United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects is certainly a contribution to the collective combat against terrorism. The effective implementation of the Programme of Action adopted by consensus at the Conference will go a long towards limiting access to these weapons by terrorist groups and individuals. The effective implementation of all other similar initiatives will be crucial to limit the possibility of use by terrorists of different kinds of weapons, including those of mass destruction.</div>
	<div class="p">The fight against terrorism is multifaceted. That can be easily understood by the words of the Secretary-General in a recent interview: "I think that as part of that fight we should intensify our efforts to get to the root causes" of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">We welcome Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, adopted on 28 September, as an immediate and comprehensive response to international terrorism as a threat to international peace and security. This Security Council resolution will foster the much-needed translation of rhetoric into practical measures.</div>
	<div class="p">We would also like to underline the importance of regional agreements and declarations to combat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms as a tool to strengthen cooperation among Member States and provide a platform for an effective implementation of the international legal regime to combat terrorism. The adoption in 1999 of the Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, to which Mozambique is a signatory, is a complementary effort by the African countries to forestall and combat terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Conscious of the need for effective national implementation measures to combat terrorism as a way to complement the international legal regime, Mozambique has already initiated a comprehensive review of international legal instruments to combat and eliminate terrorism with a view to ratifying and adhering to those to which it is not yet a party. It is our earnest hope that as a follow-up to this debate, all Member States will work towards that goal.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Al-Nasser" nation="Qatar" language="Arabic">
	Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me at the outset, to extend my congratulations to Mr. Han on his election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I wish him every success in conducting the work of this session in a manner that brings about the attainment of its objectives. I would also like to express my appreciation, on behalf of my delegation, to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless endeavours and laudable efforts in extremely complicated and difficult international conditions.</div>
	<div class="p">It is no exaggeration to say that the world situation is complex and difficult in view of the fact that our world today is rife with international conflicts that we have not been able to settle and chronic crises awaiting solutions that would break the spiral of violence and suffering threatening our human existence.</div>
	<div class="p">We the Members of the United Nations are meeting today to discuss a very serious international phenomenon that has been preying on everyone, and will continue to do so unless there is universal cooperation and solidarity to eliminate it. That phenomenon is terrorism, which requires the formulation of comprehensive international plans and approaches in the context of international legitimacy to confront international threats that do not discriminate on the basis of nationality, colour or creed, and which most certainly do not recognize any political, social, economic or geographical borders between States and peoples. We should all cooperate in order to deal with it and eradicate it so that we can look forward to a brighter future that provides decent lives for our peoples instead of disputes, quarrels and the settling of scores, no matter what the issue.</div>
	<div class="p">In order to accomplish that, we see no framework more appropriate and comprehensive than this international Organization, which we feel is the appropriate and qualified framework to determine the future of our world. It is incumbent upon all of us, irrespective of our narrow interests and political calculations, to provide the United Nations and its agencies with all the necessary resources to enable them to undertake that important role.</div>
	<div class="p">The threat of terrorism, which has preoccupied us all for some time, has now become a more serious and concrete reality. This was borne out by the attacks that targeted important sites in the United States of America on 11 September 2001, which claimed the lives of large numbers of American citizens and other innocent people. In that regard the Cabinet of the State of Qatar, at its regular meeting on 12 September 2001, presided over by His Highness Sheikh Jassem bin Hamad Al-Thani, the Heir Apparent expressed the regrets of the State of Qatar and its condemnation of the terrorist attacks to which the United States was subjected. The Cabinet also expressed the condolences and sympathy of the Emir of the State of Qatar and its Government and its people to the Government of the United States and its friendly people. The Cabinet also extended condolences to the bereaved families, to the American President and the American people, emphasizing the long-standing position of the State of Qatar to condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, regardless of its source.</div>
	<div class="p">Moreover, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, is currently paying an official visit to the United States of America, during which he will visit New York and Washington, D.C., to meet senior officials and assure them of the sympathy of the State of Qatar and its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms. Also, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr Al-Thani, the Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar, in his capacity as Chairman of the Ninth Summit Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), expressed the OIC's condemnation and denunciation of the terrorist attacks unleashed against the United States. He stressed that Islam is a religion that condemns and rejects terrorism, renounces violence and bloodshed, advocates the preservation of human life and denounces aggression against innocent people. It is a religion of tolerance and love. He also said that the Islamic world shares the pain and suffering of the United States, its people and its Government, and extends its sympathy and condolences to the bereaved families of the victims.</div>
	<div class="p">My delegation once again reiterates its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, be it terrorism perpetrated by individuals, groups or States. State terrorism is the most heinous form of terrorism, as it has an official character and targets the lives and properties of innocent people and violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and their public facilities. The international community should confront terrorism with the requisite resolve and firmness, but it must do so fairly and objectively.</div>
	<div class="p">In that regard, it is regrettable that terrorism is sometimes linked or equated with a particular group or groups of people. In that context, we cannot permit the maligning of certain religions. Everyone knows that such accusations levelled at a particular nationality or religion have serious negative implications leading to unacceptable alienation among peoples and nations. It is truly tragic that while the United Nations is doing its utmost to bring peoples closer together, there are some who are disrupting those relations among peoples by making baseless accusations.</div>
	<div class="p">On a generous invitation from His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the beloved Emir of the State of Qatar, the Government had the honour last month of hosting a group of internationally eminent persons to discuss the best means of uniting the points of view of societies to consolidate the principle of dialogue among civilizations. We the peoples of the United Nations sorely need to narrow the gap separating us from each other.</div>
	<div class="p">Everyone is aware of the critical role of the mass media in shaping public opinion on any question, be it domestic or international, and of its major responsibility to observe impartiality and complete objectivity in covering events such as those that took place in the United States recently. We must recognize terrorism for what it is, deliberate acts of violence aimed at maiming and killing innocent civilians, without hesitation or mercy, in the pursuit and service of the objectives of terrorists.</div>
	<div class="p">In the absence of a specific definition of terrorism, we stress once again the need to differentiate between terrorism, which we strongly condemn, and acts of legitimate resistance and national struggle against foreign occupation. International law and the Charter of the United Nations have guaranteed the legitimate right of all peoples under foreign occupation and control to liberate their land. The absence of such a definition has also seriously undermined international efforts to tackle this grave threat to human society. A comprehensive legal definition of terrorism must make a clear distinction between terrorism, on one hand, and the legitimate struggle of peoples, on the other hand. It should take into account all forms of terrorism, including State terrorism and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction.</div>
	<div class="p">Last but not least, the fight against terrorism requires concerted efforts on the part of the institutions of all States and on the part of the mass media, which is of great importance in this regard and which should cover the question of terrorism objectively and accurately. We must also find a serious way of developing a sound framework for an effective legal mechanism that leads to the formulation of a comprehensive international convention to control terrorism and deal with its root causes. Doing so should guarantee for future generations a safe and peaceful life in which the language of dialogue and understanding prevails, rather than one in which innocent lives are taken and peoples' resources and potentials are squandered.</div>

	Mr. Hashi (Somalia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me to convey my congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I am confident that, under his wise leadership, this session will be a productive one. I would like also to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election as Secretary-General for a second term.</div>
	<div class="p">Our congratulations to the President and to the Secretary-General have special significance for us today, since this is the first time in 10 years that a Permanent Representative of Somalia has addressed the General Assembly, which signals that Somalia is back on the international scene. In rejoining the international community, I wish, on behalf of the Government of Somalia, to thank Member States, the United Nations and particularly the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the invaluable contribution to peace-building efforts in Somalia. I wish also at this juncture to reaffirm the Somali Government's commitment to the ideals and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.</div>
	<div class="p">The horrific events of 11 September that were perpetrated against the United States were a flagrant violation of those principles. We in Somalia share the grief, pain and loss of the people of the United States. We share that pain and grief in a very profound way because we in Somalia experienced unnecessary loss of life during the civil war. We in Somalia know very well what it means to lose loved ones. The Government and the people of Somalia are shocked beyond belief.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me take this opportunity to express once again our heartfelt condolences to the people and the Government of the United States. Both the President and the Prime Minister of Somalia have also conveyed our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the victims and to the people and the Government of the United States.</div>
	<div class="p">President Abdikassim Salad Hassan, in his note to President George W. Bush dated 12 September, expressed his shock at the tragic death of innocent United States citizens and strongly deplored the cowardly terrorist action. The Prime Minister of Somalia expressed similar sentiments, and condemned international terrorism in the strongest terms. In a press release issued on 20 September, the Somali Government stated that terrorism, in all its forms, is an affront to basic human values. It is also an affront to the culture and the basic tenets of Islam.</div>
	<div class="p">As part of Somalia's contribution to the fight against this evil, our Government formed, on 30 September, a high-powered anti-terrorist task force including the Ministers of the Interior, Defence and Justice and the Attorney-General. That task force is mandated to monitor and gather information in every district of the country and will cooperate with its counterparts in other countries as well as with the Security Council and the Secretary-General. Somalia's anti-terrorist task force is further mandated to ensure the implementation of Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September 2001, including its State-level requirements. The task force will also examine all international treaties and conventions relevant to the fight against international terrorism with a view to their ratification.</div>
	<div class="p">As we are aware, terrorists in most cases use false identities by procuring passports of other nations. In order to prevent any possible misuse of its passports, the Somali Government has recently printed new Somali passports with very stringent security features. These passports are hard to forge, and their features meet the standards of passports of highly developed countries. We would like States Members of the United Nations to take note of that fact.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition to the steps I mentioned a moment ago, the Parliament of Somalia, at its tenth session, convened on 1 October 2001, issued a declaration vigorously condemning the terrorist acts of 11 September and strongly supporting Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">The position of the Somali Government on terrorism is crystal clear. We are committed to the fight against that menace. We will not permit anyone with any links to terrorism to come to our territory or to operate in it. We pledge to provide every support to the fight against international terrorism. We are confident that the international community will assist us with the support necessary to achieve that goal.</div>

	Mr. Ortiz Gandarillas (Bolivia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">On behalf of the Government and the people of Bolivia, our President, Mr. Jorge Quiroga Ramrez, has conveyed to the President of the United States, Mr. George W. Bush, our most heartfelt condolences, support and solidarity with the Government of the United States and its noble people. He also vigorously condemned the terrorist acts of 11 September.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community, represented and gathered in this Hall, is speaking out unequivocally and vigorously to condemn the sinister, unspeakable terrorist attacks perpetrated in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. The world has been witness to one of the most horrendous crimes of terrorism, unequalled and unprecedented in its premeditation and treachery. Commercial airliners full of civilians -- men, women and children -- were hijacked and used as weapons of mass destruction to sow death and desolation among innocent people from 80 countries. Our heartfelt condolences and solidarity go also to those countries.</div>
	<div class="p">This is a crime against humanity. It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic, fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal, political, moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence: respect for the right to life of every human being. A crime has been committed and must not go unpunished. No on can claim the right to assault or kill another human being. The full force of the law must fall on the perpetrators and their accomplices and protectors.</div>
	<div class="p">Bolivia condemns this and any other terrorist act, by whomever committed and towards whomever aimed. International terrorism has become a threat to peace and security, including to the independence and sovereignty of States and societies throughout the world. It has become a global phenomenon, recognizing no borders. Its goal is to destroy; it knows no law or homeland. It feeds on hatred and resentment and takes advantage of the conditions of extreme poverty and of the absence of democratic institutions in some societies.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community must now take measures and carry out urgent action to eradicate this evil. We have a series of conventions and agreements on terrorism, but they do not seem to be enough. We need to find more concrete and effective measures, such as, perhaps, a programme or plan of action on international terrorism that would channel further cooperation among States and grant a clear mandate to our Organization. In this context, Bolivia joins the international coalition against terrorism in the framework of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">There exists, alongside the crime of international terrorism, another scourge is confronting the international community: drugs and drug trafficking. Both evils sustain each other; one feeds off the resources of the other. Drug traffickers protect themselves with violence and the crimes of terrorism. Both have achieved a global dimension. The response must therefore be global too. Here again, the international community must act urgently and with greater resolve.</div>
	<div class="p">Bolivia has suffered the negative consequences of this scourge, but it has managed to fight back and almost to eliminate it through the total eradication of the cultivation of coca, which fed the manufacture of cocaine. This was not an easy struggle. It required much political will on the part of the Government and a tremendous effort on the part of the Bolivian people. That is how Bolivia has made a decisive contribution to the efforts of the international community.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, we must also recognize  while in no way implying any justification of the acts and crimes of terrorists and drug-traffickers, wherever they may take place -- that these phenomena and their growing virulence are bred and nourished in the fertile breeding grounds of the extreme poverty that afflicts a great percentage of humanity and that entails hunger, ignorance, disease, frustration and despair. The Brazilian writer and politician Josue de Castro dramatically summed up extreme poverty as a condition in which children are born not to live, but to die.</div>
	<div class="p">The international community, in the context of the United Nations, has attempted to respond to these three scourges by adopting legal instruments to prevent and punish international terrorism, to combat drug-trafficking and to alleviate extreme poverty. The outcome reveals our response to have been insufficient and inadequate. International terrorism has become more daring and virulent, drug trafficking persists and extreme poverty has spread.</div>
	<div class="p">In the face of such a situation, it is necessary and essential that we act with greater resolve and determination to shoulder our responsibilities and to adopt concrete action to avoid, prevent and eradicate these barbaric acts. No one can remain indifferent. The conceptual authors and implementers of these acts made a serious mistake in thinking that they were attacking the United States alone. In fact, the attack was directed against the entire international community and all of humanity.</div>
	<div class="p">That is why the time has come for the international community to send its cry of condemnation into every corner of the planet and to say without fear or ambivalence: no to the terror of terrorism; no to the terror of drug-trafficking; no to the terror of hunger.</div>
	<div class="p">The world can no longer tolerate or endure these scourges. We must change direction. I therefore wish to appeal, with all due respect, to the entire international community to forge a new world conscience with a new vision and new approaches to the problems we are confronting today and thus to build a better world in which the values and principles that we all recognize -- freedom, equality, equity, justice, peace and well-being -- are fully realized to the benefit of all. To achieve these aspirations, genuine cooperation and solidarity among all nations is imperative. That is how we will build new societies in which we will be able to say, paraphrasing Josue de Castro, that children will be born not to die, but to live.</div>

	Mr. Vento (Italy)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">In taking the floor, allow me first of all to express Italy's full endorsement of the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Belgium on behalf of the European Union.</div>
	<div class="p">The tragedy that struck the United States on 11 September lends even greater urgency to the United Nations activity, both in preventing and fighting international terrorism and in seeking to alleviate the root causes of such unprecedented phenomena.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations was founded in 1945 for the basic purpose of preventing the conflagration of another global conflict. Ever since, it has worked to develop the instruments it needs to carry out that mandate. Sadly, with the arrival of the new millennium, a new threat to international peace and security has appeared on the horizon -- new not so much in its genius as in its catastrophic dimensions. To fight that threat, the United Nations must once again seek to develop the appropriate instruments, as it has in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy.</div>
	<div class="p">Italy, in expressing its full solidarity with the United States Government and citizens, particularly the families and friends of the victims, also underlines its determination to participate resolutely at both the international and national levels in a global strategy against terrorism. Our attitude is inspired by the conclusions of the extraordinary European Council of 21 September. We fully share the European Union's conviction that the coalition against terrorism should be as broad as possible and under the aegis of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Already in July, in its capacity as President, Italy had promoted a G-8 condemnation of all forms of terrorism that stressed the need for enhanced international cooperation on drafting effective prevention and enforcement strategies. On that same occasion, the foreign ministers of the eight countries underlined the need for the broadest possible implementation of the 12 United Nations sectoral anti-terrorism conventions, including the most recent one on the financing of terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Italy is also this year's President of the Group of Counter-Terrorism Experts, which conducts analytical studies of the phenomenon and fosters judicial and intelligence cooperation. The events of three weeks ago have lent even greater importance to the Group's goal of drafting effective guidelines for the application of the most recent anti-terrorism Convention, which my Government is determined to ratify at the earliest date.</div>
	<div class="p">The horrors of 11 September show that terrorism constitutes a global threat that requires an immediate global response. The existence of geographic areas or legal loopholes that provide shelter or protection to criminals and their interests creates zones of impunity and represents a grave threat to international peace and security. This threat, as Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1368-2001">resolution 1368 (2001)</a> so clearly recognizes, is not against individual States or societies, but against the whole set of values that hold the international community together and lie at the foundation of the United Nations. Therefore today's challenge is to close these loopholes; to genuinely bar the road to terrorism and suppress its means of support; and to eliminate impunity. Resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">1373 (2001)</a>, adopted last Friday, meets these demands. The expeditious manner in which it was adopted by the 15 members of the Security Council reflects the new spirit of cooperation against terrorism and the broad support that has arisen within the United Nations and around the world for a crackdown on terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The resolution strengthens several commitments already included in the 12 United Nations sectoral conventions against terrorism, making them instantly binding for all Member States, in the light of Chapter VII of the Charter. Nevertheless, it still leaves some grey zones that should be eliminated if we wish to achieve a truly global anti-terrorism strategy. The sectoral approach of the aforementioned conventions should thus, in our view, be integrated by a general legal instrument that allows the repression of any terrorist act, wherever and by whomever it is committed. This is why I am joining my voice to the many that preceded me, particularly that of the presidency of the European Union, in underlining that the work of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Sixth Committee on elaborating a comprehensive international convention should proceed promptly and with the broadest and most constructive participation of all Member States.</div>
	<div class="p">We hope also that the negotiations to define the text of an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism can be resumed as soon as possible. Finally, we cannot forget that chemical or biological weapons could also be among the new and terrifying instruments involved in the terrorist threat.</div>
	<div class="p">Earlier I mentioned the need to eliminate the "grey zones" of impunity for those who commit terrorist acts. The aforementioned Security Council resolution commits all Member States to consider terrorist acts as serious criminal offences and to ensure that the seriousness of such acts is duly reflected in the punishment meted out to them. But the global nature of the threat facing us today and, consequently, the possibility of a global terrorist act, lend even greater urgency to the creation of an International Criminal Court. To finally endow the international legal system with a judicial instrument shared by the whole community of States, we hope that the 60 ratifications needed for the Rome Statute to enter into effect can be rapidly attained. We agree with the Secretary-General's appeal in his recent report on the work of the Organization for all Member States to take the decision to sign and ratify the Statute.</div>
	<div class="p">A complementary but no less important role in the fight against terrorism is played by the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, adopted by the General Assembly last December and opened for signature in Palermo at a ceremony attended by 148 Member States. The rapid entry into force of that Convention and its three protocols -- against trafficking in human beings, smuggling of migrants and trafficking in arms -- would be a major step towards stopping any and all activities that foster, even collaterally, terrorist acts.</div>
	<div class="p">The Italian Government is convinced that the desire for decisive, lasting results in the fight against international terrorism should not lead us to neglect the broader picture. In other words, this fight should be accompanied by measures aimed at promoting stronger government institutions; safeguarding the human, civil, economic and cultural rights of all communities; fostering the return of refugees to their homes; and rebuilding the social and economic fabric. We feel it is fundamental to participate actively in United Nations efforts to strengthen the bases of collective security and to prevent regional conflicts. Therefore we fully support the Secretary-General's recent report on the issue, which gives the concept of governance the requisite consideration in the areas of development and peace.</div>
	<div class="p">We also feel that a commitment to humanitarian assistance is crucial, namely with respect to the tragic situation of refugees and internally displaced persons. For this purpose, we have already allocated $7 million to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Moreover, our Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Ms. Boniver, has just visited the Afghan refugee camps on the border of Pakistan.</div>
	<div class="p">On several occasions Italy, together with its European partners, has underlined the need for a comprehensive approach to the problem of international terrorism and for stepped-up cooperation on analysing its root causes, so as to better stop, and even prevent, such phenomena. In its foreign policy, the Italian Government intends to give the necessary emphasis to actions aimed at eradicating poverty, fighting HIV/AIDS and other widespread contagious diseases, safeguarding the environment and protecting human and social rights. In short, we intend to resolutely pursue the goal of building a better world, enshrined in the last year's report of the Secretary-General, entitled "We the people", which was approved by the heads of State and Government in the Millennium Declaration and embraced by the Genoa Summit of the G-8.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Gaspar Martins" nation="Angola" language="">
	Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly and to wish him every success in his new role.</div>
	<div class="p">We are grateful to the Mayor of New York, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, for the inspiring statement he made on Monday. We take this opportunity to reiterate to him, to the people of our host city, New York, and to the families of the victims our deepest sympathy following the tragedy of 11 September. We commend the people of the United States for the courage and resilience they demonstrated, and continue to demonstrate, following the terrorist attacks.</div>
	<div class="p">The topic of this debate is of transcendental importance to humanity as a whole and, in particular, to the United Nations, a forum whose responsibilities include the maintenance of international peace and security. This ought to be the guiding principle of our common fight against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations is a forum wherein all peace-loving nations can jointly address the ills of the world. By employing a well-tested system of participation and representation, Member States come together in this great city, under the auspices of this noble Organization, to debate and agree on principles and standards for cohabitation on this fragile planet. In the past, we have been called upon to debate, and find solutions to, problems affecting our occupancy of this planet. These range from poverty alleviation and conflict resolution to health-related issues. This week we have been called upon to debate, and contribute to finding a solution to, another issue affecting all of us: terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorism is a scourge that affects all of us, as it threatens the very way of life we have come to cherish. It challenges the economic and political institutions we have erected; it undermines the principles of interaction among States; it negates due process; and, worst of all, it fails to adhere to internationally accepted standards for conflict resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">Terrorists destroy vital social and economic infrastructure in their arbitrarily selected target countries. Through their actions, terrorists deprive innocent victims of their livelihood. By their very existence, terrorists undermine the will of the governed and the internationally accepted standards and mechanisms for political participation. Whether their actions manifest themselves within the host country or beyond its borders, their tactics are equally deplorable and deserving of swift and effective measures to eradicate them from the face of the earth.</div>
	<div class="p">The United Nations must play a crucial role in combating international terrorism by adopting a global strategy that should include clear political, military, diplomatic, economic and legal measures in order to eliminate it. Angola therefore welcomed the adoption by the Security Council of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which deals with all aspects of terrorism through a global and holistic approach. The resolution, inter alia, calls upon Member States to become party to the relevant international conventions relating to terrorism, including the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, of 9 December 1999, and we urge all Member States to take immediate action to give effect to the provisions of the resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">The Angolan people have historically suffered the carnage resulting from the cruel and horrible acts perpetrated by UNITA, led by Mr. Savimbi. Those terrorist organization has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and massive damage to the economy and created thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons. Those acts by UNITA continue to sow death and undermine the functioning of democratic institutions and the development of the country. In their essence and objectives, those actions contain all the elements that characterize the concept of the crime of terrorism. As such, the international community has, in a timely manner, expressed its condemnation by imposing sanctions, as in Security Council resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-864-1993">864 (1993)</a>, <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1127-1997">1127 (1997)</a>, <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1173-1998">1173 (1998)</a>, <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1202-1998">1202 (1998)</a> and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1295-2000">1295 (2000)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">More recently, those acts by UNITA were also condemned by the Security Council in a statement to the press on 16 August 2001 and in a presidential statement on 20 September 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">Angola has been strengthening its cooperation and coordination with neighbouring States, in particular to combat all crimes connected to terrorism, including drug-trafficking, the illicit arms trade, money-laundering and other such crimes. Angola has signed the Organization of African Unity Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, of 14 July 1999. Angola is also party to the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed on 14 September 1963; the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, which entered into force on 14 October 1971; and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed on 23 September 1971.</div>
	<div class="p">We are grateful to the delegation of India for presenting the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism. We also appreciate the draft convention to combat nuclear terrorism, submitted by the Russian Federation. We support the proposals contained therein and hope that all members will approach both drafts in a constructive and productive manner with a view to their early adoption.</div>
	<div class="p">Member States should be particularly attentive to terrorists who are in the guise of freedom fighters or who act in the name of religion, self-determination and sovereignty. As the Secretary-General has reminded us, the laws of civilized behaviour should apply to all.</div>
	<div class="p">In summary, let me state that we the peoples of the United Nations should be determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of terrorism; to reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small; to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained; and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.</div>
	<div class="p">To conclude, I am confident that the spirit that created this noble Organization will prevail and make a very useful contribution to the adoption of relevant measures which will unite us more closely in the fight to eliminate terrorism. That would be the best way to honour the victims of 11 September.</div>
