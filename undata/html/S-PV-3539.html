	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-390.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/390</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1995-337.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/337</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 27 April 1995 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan of 12 May 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-390.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/390</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the Joint Statement of the delegation of the Government of Tajikistan and the delegation of the Tajik opposition signed in Moscow on 26 April 1995 as a result of the high-level consultations through the good offices of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy with the assistance of the representatives of all countries acting as observers at the inter-Tajik talks (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-337.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/337</a>, annex). The Council expects the full implementation of the agreements reached in Moscow and, in particular, supports the convening of the fourth round of inter-Tajik talks on 22 May 1995 in Almaty and looks to the parties to cooperate fully in those talks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council commends the efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, the Russian Federation as a host country and all observer countries which significantly contributed to the positive outcome of the high-level inter-Tajik consultations held in Moscow from 19 to 26 April 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council is concerned over the actions of both sides in the past three months, which posed obstacles to the peace process, as noted in the report of the Secretary-General. The Council stresses the urgent need for the Tajik parties to resolve the conflict and to confirm, by taking concrete steps, their commitment to achieve national reconciliation in the country exclusively through peaceful political means on the basis of mutual concessions and compromises. In this context, it welcomes the agreement by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan and the leader of the Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan to hold a meeting, which took place in Kabul on 17-19 May 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council notes with concern the recent inactivity of the Joint Commission and is therefore encouraged by the parties' decision to strengthen the Commission and its mechanism for monitoring the Cease-Fire Agreement of 17 September 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1102.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1102</a>, annex I). It welcomes the commitments by some Member States to the voluntary fund for contributions established by the Secretary-General in accordance with its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-968(1995).pdf" class="nolink">resolution 968 (1995)</a>, and reiterates its encouragement to other Member States to contribute.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council calls upon the parties to agree on a substantial extension of the Cease-Fire Agreement of 17 September 1994 and to achieve substantive progress during the fourth round of inter-Tajik talks, in particular on fundamental institutional issues and consolidation of the statehood of Tajikistan as defined in the agenda agreed upon during the Moscow round in April 1994. It stresses that strict compliance by the parties with all the obligations they have assumed is a necessary condition for successful political dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council notes the observation of the Secretary-General contained in his report of 12 May 1995 that grounds exist for continuing United Nations efforts and maintaining the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan and recalls its view that extension of the cease-fire is necessary for this."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-28.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/28</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
