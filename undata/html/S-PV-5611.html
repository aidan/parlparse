	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern over the continued violence inside Somalia, in particular the recent intensified fighting between the Union of Islamic Courts and the Transitional Federal Institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council calls upon all parties to draw back from conflict, recommit to dialogue, immediately implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1725(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1725 (2006)</a> and refrain from any actions that could provoke or perpetuate violence and violations of human rights, contribute to unnecessary tension and mistrust, endanger the ceasefire and political process or further damage the humanitarian situation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia through the Transitional Federal Charter, stressing the importance of broad-based and representative institutions and of an inclusive political process, as envisaged in the Transitional Federal Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates that the Transitional Federal Charter and Institutions offer the only route to achieving peace and stability in Somalia, and emphasizes the need for continued credible dialogue between the Transitional Federal Institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts. The Council therefore urges the Transitional Federal Institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts to fulfil commitments they have made, resume without delay peace talks on the basis of the agreements reached in Khartoum, adhere to agreements reached in their dialogue and establish a stable security situation inside Somalia. The Security Council welcomes all regional and international efforts to promote and encourage political dialogue between the Transitional Federal Institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts, and expresses its full support for these initiatives."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-59.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/59</a>.</p>
