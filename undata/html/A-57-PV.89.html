	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">All members of the General Assembly are eligible in this election except those already represented in the General Committee, namely, those countries whose representatives have been elected to the presidency of the General Assembly or to the chairmanships of the Main Committees for the fifty-eighth session.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-33-138.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 33/138</a>, the 21 Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly for its fifty-eighth session shall be elected according to the following pattern: six representatives from African States; five representatives from Asian States; one representative from an Eastern European State; two representatives from Latin American and Caribbean States; two representatives from Western European and other States; and representatives of the five permanent members of Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">In accordance with paragraph 16 of annex VI to the rules of procedure, the election of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly by secret ballot will be dispensed with when the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled. We shall proceed accordingly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">I shall now read out the names of the endorsed candidates.</p>
	<blockquote id="pg001-bk05-pa06">African States: Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar, Malawi,  Morocco and Senegal.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg001-bk05-pa07">Asian States: the Islamic Republic of Iran, Myanmar, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Yemen.</blockquote>

	<blockquote id="pg001-bk05-pa09">Latin American and Caribbean States: Haiti and Honduras.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg001-bk05-pa10">Western European and other States: Luxembourg and the Netherlands.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa11">Since the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled in each region, I declare those candidates elected, in addition to the representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa12">The following States have thus been elected to vice-presidencies of the General Assembly for its fifty-eighth session: Cape Verde, China, Equatorial Guinea, France, Haiti, Honduras, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Myanmar, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and Yemen.</p>
