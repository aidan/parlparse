<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zackheos</span> <span class="nation">Cyprus</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">I would like, at the outset, to express my pleasure at the great number of countries that joined in sponsoring the present draft resolution, which shows the importance that the international community places on the Olympic ideal.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">The great challenge now is to take the first practical steps towards turning into reality the observance of the Olympic Truce during the Summer and Winter Olympics, starting with next year's Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The Olympic Truce is an expression of the yearning of mankind for peace, understanding and reconciliation and for the noble notion of distinction based on honest competition. In the search for excellence every athlete is equal, and victory is the result of ability, training, hard work and perseverance. Discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, sex or other characteristic is incompatible with the Olympic spirit.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">It is important to strengthen adherence to Olympic ethics, especially the need to conduct the Games in a fair way. In this context, the efforts against the use of prohibited anabolic and other drugs are to be commended.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">Cyprus, a small country, has since its independence followed an active foreign policy based on the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, which coincide with and fully adhere to the Olympic ideals. The latest manifestation of our determination to become a bridge of peace in our sensitive region in the eastern Mediterranean and a homeland of harmony and understanding for all communities living on the island is the proposal of President Clerides for the demilitarization of Cyprus. On this solemn occasion, we renew our appeal for the acceptance of this proposal, so that Cyprus will be able to participate in the next Olympics as a reunited and peaceful State.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">The people of Cyprus felt immense satisfaction over the decision of the International Olympic Committee concerning the hosting of the Olympic Games in Greece in 2004, the birthplace of the Olympic Movement. We interpret this decision as an appeal for a new beginning and as an expression of the collective will of mankind to make the twenty-first century a period of serious efforts for peace and the advancement of social progress and prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">The twentieth century, which is approaching its end, has seen two world wars, ideological antagonisms, regional and local conflicts and the policy of ethnic cleansing. It is hoped that human rights and the respect of international law will be the norm of the day in the new millennium.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">I would like, in conclusion, to express our appreciation for the great efforts of the International Olympic Committee in imbuing youth with these ideals, which is a guarantee of a better and more humane world.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Simonovic´</span> <span class="nation">Croatia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">First, I wish to express the deep sympathy of neighbouring Croatia to the Italian people and the bereaved family on the passing of Amintore Fanfani, the former Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy. He was a true statesman.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">Also, may I express the pleasure of Croatia at seeing His Serene Highness presiding over this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">There are few issues that bring virtually all Member States of the United Nations together as does the one that we are considering today: the Olympic ideal. The principles upon which the modern Olympic Games were developed by Pierre de Coubertin are of lasting import to mankind. It is only appropriate, therefore, that given the commonality between the Olympic ideal and the goals of the United Nations, it has become an established practice for this item to be included in the agenda of the General Assembly session preceding each Olympic year.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">The fundamental principles of the Olympic charter speak of placing sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to encouraging the establishment of a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity. In the pursuance of these aims, the Olympic Movement -- whether acting unilaterally or with other organizations -- strives to contribute to a peaceful and better world, free of discrimination. At the same time, the strivings of the United Nations Organization, as set out in its Charter, include, <i>inter alia</i>, the maintenance of peace and security, the development of friendly relations among nations based on the principles of equal rights and self-determination and the achievement of international cooperation. It is clear that the two institutions, each in their own way, seek to achieve humanity's most noble and honourable goals.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa05">As a relatively new country born during turbulent times, Croatia has a particular affinity for the values of the Olympic ideal. While a war of aggression was being waged against it, and after it had received international recognition only some months prior, Croatia participated with distinction at the Barcelona Olympic Games. The symbolism of joining the family of nations through becoming a member of the United Nations and soon thereafter participating in the Olympics was of special significance in those trying times. Both remain wonderful, moving events in the history of my country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa06">We look forward to the continued development of joint endeavours between the Olympic Movement and the United Nations across the spectrum of United Nations activity. By working together on the areas of common interest, Member States will contribute to the achievement of the goals of both institutions. While Olympism is dominated by the symbolism of sportsmanship, solidarity and the promotion of mutual understanding, it can also make a very concrete contribution to a better and more peaceful world. To this end, the practical cooperation between the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee in the health, environmental, humanitarian and cultural fields represents the beginnings of mutually fruitful initiatives.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa07">Sport can indeed serve diplomacy. The coming together of athletes from all over the world helps us to see that we are not so dissimilar as human beings -- that although we may come from different cultural or religious traditions, we all have similar hopes and strivings.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa08">Croatia welcomes the efforts of the International Olympic Committee in launching an appeal for an Olympic Truce and hopes that it will be respected in all areas of conflict around the world. The draft resolution before us -- which, <i>inter alia</i>, urges Member States to observe the Truce -- represents an important, tangible contribution of the Olympic Movement to the most important goal of the United Nations. Cooperation between the two organizations on this issue, therefore, is only right and proper.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa09">Finally, Croatia is convinced that the Games of the XXVII Olympiad, to be held next year in Sydney, Australia, will make a significant contribution to the attainment of the goals of the Olympic ideal. We welcome the initiative of Australia to have this draft resolution introduced by Mr. Daniel Kowalski, a man whose sporting achievements reflect the Olympic spirit and who is a credit to his country.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dugan</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">The United States delegation supports the positive role that sports can play towards achieving a peaceful and better world. In particular, it believes in the Olympic ideal and encourages those who work daily -- the athletes, coaches, families and organizations -- to make that ideal a reality.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">The United States delegation has co-sponsored the Assembly's adoption of five previous resolutions in this vein and enthusiastically joins consensus today again for building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal. Today's text makes Assembly history. At 180 co-sponsors, it is the most co-sponsored draft resolution ever. If the United Nations were to award gold medals, this initiative would receive one.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">Today's draft resolution enables the Assembly to underscore the fact that good sportsmanship promotes a worldwide culture of peace, tolerance and understanding, particularly among young people. We as Member States set a powerful example for the youth of the world today in swearing the Olympic Truce.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">Our statement was to have been made by Mr. Irwin Belk, a businessman and philanthropist who is serving on the United States delegation to the fifty-fourth session of the Assembly as a public delegate. Unfortunately, he was unable to be here this afternoon and sends his regards. He wished me to share with the Assembly that at 78 years of age, he continues to be enthusiastic about sports being for all people, young and old. One of the purposes of public delegates, according to Eleanor Roosevelt, who established the tradition, was to bring directly the perspective and experience of the American public to the Assembly's considerations on matters that affect us all.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">Apart from having attended all Games of the Olympiad since 1960, Mr. Belk has had the privilege to serve the United States Olympic Committee for over 30 years. This has been in addition to serving on the boards of many institutions of higher learning throughout the southern United States. In marrying together those two interests, he has endowed many colleges and universities with athletic field houses, competition track facilities, university buildings, and he has funded athletic programs and student scholarships. For example, on the campus of East Carolina University, he contributed to the establishment of the L.T. Walker International Human Performance Centre, named for the past President of the United States Olympic Committee, Mr. Leroy Walker. The Centre is unique in being more than a training facility. It provides foreign Olympic athletes and coaches the techniques and knowledge to take home to improve an entire sports programme. Such programmes across the United States and around the world support the goal of Olympism, which is to place everywhere sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to encouraging the establishment of a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa06">Another good friend of Mr. Belk was Mr. Jack Kelly, past President of the United States Olympic Committee, the son of an Olympian gold medalist -- and an Olympian silver medalist himself -- and the beloved uncle of our Acting President. Mr. Kelly was a champion of Olympism, and it is indeed a testament to the Olympic spirit that sport can build friendships and bridges across the miles and over the years. The United States delegation is happy to note that you, Sir, as an Olympic athlete and an International Olympic Committee member, still keep the tradition of the family.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa07">In anticipation of today's meeting, the draft resolution was shared with members of the United States Olympic Committee. They wish us well here today. Education through sport is only half of the Olympic philosophy; it is also education through culture. This combination of sport and culture is what establishes the ideals of peace in the minds of men, women and youth.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa08">Last June's conference, organized by the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), made a solemn appeal that education for a culture of peace through sport become a priority action at the international, regional, national and local levels. Throughout the United States sport and education indeed go hand in hand. International action is promising as well. The recently established International Olympic Forum for Development, in which the United States participates, also is unifying different organizations toward their shared goal -- to make physical education and sport for all a reality.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa09">The United Nations increasingly attests to the unifying power of sport. The day before the New York City Marathon, 12,000 runners from abroad gathered on the lawn of the United Nations for a rally and friendship run to Central Park. This year the Foreign Minister of Germany, Joschka Fischer, participated as a contestant, and we congratulate him and the German delegation to the United Nations on his competitive spirit and sportsmanship. Also, the United Nations flag is flying over more and more sporting venues, and the Secretary-General himself recently attended the Women's World Cup in soccer and also threw out the opening pitch at the recent baseball World Series in the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa10">Today's appeal for peace under the Olympic Truce is a solemn moment for us all. It is essentially a humanitarian action. On this closing point, let us take note of the Olympic Movement's many humanitarian activities to promote, through sport, the quality of life and well-being of those living in the most disadvantaged parts of the world. There are children in refugee camps, in displacement, in onerous labour conditions, in war, in conflict, in severe poverty or in urban violence. The Olympic Movement, through its International Cooperation Department, has taken several initiatives in organizing activities to overcome idleness and boredom; to teach those children fair play, tolerance and understanding; and to build friendships, all in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Development Programme, among others. This cooperation has been encouraged by Assembly resolutions since 1994. It is a story that is not often told, and yet it is at the core of building a peaceful and better world through sport.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Petrella</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">It is an honour for Argentina to participate in the consideration of item 22 on the Assembly's agenda, entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal" and to co-sponsor the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.26.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/L.26</a>, introduced by the representative of Australia.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The large number of co-sponsors attests to the importance that the international community attaches to the Olympic ideal as a tool for promoting peaceful international relations. This also augurs well for observance of the Olympic Truce during the upcoming XXVII Olympic Games, to be held in Sydney in September 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">The United Nations appeals to the parties to conflicts to suspend hostilities during the holding of the upcoming Olympic Games and urges all States to abide by the Truce, both individually and collectively, and to strive to settle their disputes peacefully.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">Argentina would like to associate itself with other statements congratulating the International Olympic Committee on its work, and encourages that body to continue to pursue its initiatives and programmes designed to use the Olympic Truce as an instrument for promoting peace and dialogue in areas of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">The Olympic ideal, which is based on a spirit of tolerance, fellowship, understanding among peoples and the dignity of human life, extends beyond the area of sport into everyday life, allowing for free cultural exchange and for greater cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">The Olympic ethic allows no form of discrimination. In the quest for excellence, all athletes are equal and triumph is no more than the result of skill, training and perseverance -- a reward for personal dedication and effort, with no other gain than the prestige of the country that the athlete represents.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">Sports are part of the life of all peoples, and competitions encourage nations to lay aside their differences and enhance cultural and personal exchanges. In a world threatened by hunger, unemployment and violations of human rights, sports can become a valid tool for mitigating the adverse effects of these problems in the most sensitive groups in society. As models of society, athletes have a prominent role to play in preventing drug abuse and urban crime. In this context, Argentina stresses the importance of operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution, which provides for the use of the Olympic Truce as an instrument to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation, even beyond the period the Olympic Games, thereby bringing the Olympic ideal closer to the objectives of the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">Argentina supports the establishment, under the International Olympic Committee, of an International Olympic Forum for Development and an International Centre for the Olympic Truce designed to promote peace and human values through sport and the Olympic ideal.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa09">My delegation would like to call attention to the integrative function of sports in a variety of areas of real life. In the area of peacekeeping operations, it is a tool for the reintegration of ex-combatants; in the field of social education, it is a way of promoting the reintegration of those social groups that have been marginalized; and in the domain of environmental protection, it is an effective way of ensuring that people can live in harmony with their surroundings, thereby bringing an aspect of sustainable development into the realm of sports education.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa10">Finally, my delegation would like to wish Australia, the host country for the next Olympics, every success, and reaffirm its support for the draft resolution we are considering.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zmeevski</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Sport and peace are concepts that are not only related but part of one organic whole. An essential condition for competition on the playing field is the absence of war on the battlefield. Sport brings people together; its inherent rivalry is not a clash between foes, but a competition between partners and colleagues who are like-minded in their shared quest for perfection.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The role of sport as an ambassador for peace is particularly important when it is hallowed by the noble traditions of the Olympic Truce. Today we are all capable of assessing what is urgently needed to educate future generations in the spirit of a culture of peace, non-violence and tolerance. It has been repeatedly shown that the ideas of ancient Greece are not outdated, but with the passing of time they resonate with new and greater relevance than ever. The Olympic flame must illuminate the way forward for humanity into the third millennium; it must be a beacon that lights the way to a world without enmity and violence. It is important that we acknowledge that today, on the threshold of the twenty-first century, and as the international community steps out of the old and into the new world order.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">In June this year, President Boris Yeltsin put forward an initiative promoting a common effort to develop a concept of peace for the twenty-first century. The goal is to create a new culture of peace in which the highest priority for peoples and individuals is a world without wars and conflicts. One of the components of that concept could be the establishment, at the international and national levels, of conditions in which peace could be established and maintained by sport, among other things.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">We consider it to be profoundly symbolic that the year 2000 -- the first year of a new millennium -- declared by the United Nations as the International Year for the Culture of Peace, is also an Olympic year. This coincidence increases our awareness that sport and peace are links in the same chain. They are Ariadne's thread, which will lead us back out of the labyrinth of today's dramas and tensions and into the light. Certainly, the Olympic ideal is one of the key elements.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Russia is an active participant in the Olympic Movement and aware of its powerful potential as a force for peace. Many Olympic cities throughout the world have clear memories of our athletes -- not only of their victories and records, but of the spirit of openness and honest competition and the warmth and ties of friendship that they established. In 1980, Moscow had the honour of hosting the twenty-second Summer Olympic Games. It was an unforgettable celebration for ten of thousands of foreign guests and tens of millions of people in our country, for it was the first time we had ever carried the Olympic baton as host of the Games. To this day the memory of that event remains fresh in Russia.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">In July 1998 Moscow greeted Olympic participants from the whole world, this time youthful representatives of various countries. This was a Moscow city government initiative, with State support. The capital of Russia was the host, under the patronage of the International Olympic Committee, of the first-ever World Youth Games. More than 7,000 young athletes from 131 countries participated. This event, unusual in Olympic practice, prompted a worldwide response, and not only in sporting circles. We believe that the idea of the World Youth Games is worth serious consideration and should be developed because of the enormous educational significance of the Olympic ideal, whose most promising followers are young athletes. It is possible that a form of the Olympic Games for young people might become one of the further developments of the Olympic Movement in the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">In September 2000, when the leaders of all countries will join here together at United Nations Headquarters in New York for the Millennium Summit and Assembly to consider plans to strengthen peace, in Sydney the torch of the twenty-seventh Olympic Games will be lighted. In this way, both here on the East River and in the stadiums of Australia, although in different ways, the goals of strengthening peace will be determined. We sincerely wish every success to the organizers, whose declared goal is achieving harmony through sport at the Olympic Games. We are confident that as we stand on the threshold of a new millennium, the ideals of peace, demonstrated through the Olympic Games, will blaze with new glory. The Russian Federation is proud to be a sponsor of the draft resolution now before us.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Miss Durrant</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">It my pleasure to address the Assembly today on agenda item 22, entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal".</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The Olympic ideal mirrors the fundamental objectives of the United Nations in seeking peace and understanding among nations and peoples. Indeed, the presence of the flag of the United Nations at all Olympic events is a testament to the shared vision of the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The Olympic games remain a shining symbol of our continuing quest to test the limits of human endeavour. Even more, the Olympic spirit embraces the valuable tenets of fair play and the importance of teamwork, diligence, commitment and hard work.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">We thank the delegation of Australia for introducing <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.26.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/54/L.26</a>. As we prepare to meet the challenges of peacemaking and peace-building in the new millennium, it is fitting that the United Nations should devote special attention to the goal of building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal. In keeping with that goal, the United Nations, through <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-11.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 48/11</a>, revived the ancient Greek tradition of the Olympic Truce, which calls for all hostilities to cease during the Games. The ancient nature of this tradition is a significant reminder that countries have traditionally seen the value of sport as a catalyst for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">In recent years, we have seen an increase in conflicts motivated by racism, xenophobia and intolerance. The Games and the spirit of the Olympic ideal, are intended to promote friendship, mutual understanding and cooperation among the nations and the peoples of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">For these reasons, the Government of Jamaica supports the call for the reaffirmation of the Olympic Truce during the Games of the XXVII Olympiad, to be held at Sydney in September 2000. We also support the reaffirmation of the Truce prior to each Summer and each Winter Olympic Games.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Jamaica has had a rich tradition of excellence in the field of sports since the 1940s, when our track and field greats captured the imagination of the world, at a difficult time immediately after the Second World War. That tradition has lived on, and today Jamaica is regarded as a foremost sporting nation in a number of disciplines. Perhaps the one in which we have been able to win the greatest number of accolades for our performance is in the area of track and field. These performances have helped to create a visibility, admiration and respect disproportionate to Jamaica's demographic and economic size.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">It is a miracle, even to Jamaicans, that, with limited financial resources, equipment and formal training, many of our young people have risen to become world-class athletes. Many have used their talents to assist with their education, and all have recognized the value of sports, particularly community sports, for the stability of their communities and of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">In many communities in Jamaica, people set about creating their own facilities and sports teams and organizing tournaments, fully understanding the power of sports to foster peace and counter juvenile delinquency. In its national youth policy, the Government of Jamaica has taken decisive steps to recognize the link between sports and cultural activities and the growth and development of our young people.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">The Government has recognized the fact that sports can be a vehicle for preparing young people for life. The construction of sports facilities has therefore been a major focus of the Jamaica Social Investment Fund, which supports community-based projects. The fund, created in 1996, has already approved the construction of several mini-football stadiums as well as community basketball and netball courts.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">The benefits which have accrued to Jamaica as a result of its participation in various sporting activities, including the Olympic Games, are real and substantial. For this reason, my delegation is proud to be a sponsor of <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.26.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/54/L.26</a>, entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal".</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Boisson</span> <span class="nation">Monaco</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">For the Principality of Monaco, a sponsor of <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.26.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/54/L.26</a>, interest in sport is as deep-seated as our interest in art and culture. This has given rise to the creation of major sporting events such as the Herculis meet and the Monaco International Marathon, which passes through the territories of three States: France, Italy and the Principality of Monaco. Despite its small size, my country is home to many internationally-recognized sporting associations and federations, which make an important contribution to disseminating the true Olympic spirit, especially among Monaco's young people.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Monaco is also the headquarters of many international sporting associations. The General Association of International Sports Federations, founded in 1967, encompasses more than 75 sporting bodies, international federations and associations. Since 1968, the International Association for Non-Violent Sport has been working to promote the cultural and educational functions of sport by speaking out against doping, chauvinism, cheating -- in a word, against all forms of rejection of the Olympic spirit.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">The Union International de Pentathlon Moderne, the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the World Confederation of Boules Sport, the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour Europe and the International Powerboating Union all have their headquarters in Monaco.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">To help ensure that our young people are imbued with sport and its values, the Government of the Principality is striving, <i>inter alia</i>, to promote sports in schools from the very earliest age by teaching physical education and swimming. To that end, all schools built over the past two decades are equipped with sports facilities including gymnasiums and, sometimes, swimming pools. The Louis II stadium complex gives priority admission to students whose schools are not yet adequately equipped.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">Secondly, we are promoting mass sport by enabling young people to engage in the greatest possible number of sports. In the Principality there are more than 70 different sports, and the Government of Monaco generously subsidizes the relevant groups to help them function properly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">Finally, we are encouraging competitive sports by creating first-class facilities. Sport classes are scheduled so that athletes, particularly young athletes, can balance academic and sporting activities. And especially talented young people can get financial assistance to help them reach their goals.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Today's debate demonstrates the determination of the international community to encourage all efforts to promote Olympic values, respect for one's opponents, and friendship among peoples. We are most encouraged by support for the Olympic Truce and by the appeals made in that connection to belligerent parties during the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Here, it is important to recall that cooperation between the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee gained a new and very important dimension in 1993 with the General Assembly's adoption at its forty-eighth session of a resolution by which it revived the ancient Greek symbol of the Olympic Truce.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">It was in 1994, in Lillehammer, that this very positive initiative was implemented for the first time. Ever since that memorable date, the United Nations, with the very valuable support of the Secretary-General, has repeatedly encouraged the endeavours of the International Olympic Committee -- in 1995, then again in 1997 -- by adopting resolutions recalling the original goals of "a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal".</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">In February 1998, on the occasion of the eighteenth Winter Games, held in Nagano, Mr. Kofi Annan and the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko made a solemn and moving appeal for a suspension of conflicts, stressing not only the symbolic but also the very tangible value of that initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">Allow me also to recall the contribution that the International Olympic Committee has been making to the United Nations Development Programme to promote activities in support of the fight against poverty and social marginalization. Athletes at the twenty-sixth Olympic Games held in Atlanta in 1996, widely supported the worldwide appeal against poverty. Some of them became involved in events at the national or regional level during the week dedicated to the issue of the eradication of poverty, which was part of the Decade dedicated to this theme by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa11">Among other missions to which the International Olympic Committee is very much committed, one might cite those designed to strengthen inter-ethnic understanding, as well as those conducted jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in the form of pilot projects, notably in Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Ecuador and Tanzania. Other cooperative projects linking the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee should also be highlighted, such as those entered into with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Nepal, Ghana, Kenya, Guatemala and Tanzania. The same applies to the initiative launched by the International Olympic Committee in the Balkans last March to assist refugees from Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa12">On a very regular basis, the Olympic Committee is also working together with the United Nations Environment Programme -- for example at the World Conference on Sport and Environment and various regional gatherings on this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa13">The Committee has also been involved with the United Nations Drug Control Programme by organizing an international conference on this issue, as well as through travelling photo exhibits and a round table. This cooperation is, of course, representative of the International Olympic Committee's unflagging commitment to fight doping. The World Conference on Doping in Sports, held in February 1999, also marked an opportunity for close cooperation between these two institutions. The creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, near the headquarters of the International Olympic Committee, further testifies to the existence of the necessary international determination to fight this scourge effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa14">Initiatives and actions by the Olympic Committee since the General Assembly considered this same item two years ago show clearly the interest that the Governments of many countries attach to developing and strengthening Olympic activities and to international cooperation in this realm, which leads to better understanding among athletes everywhere. Our world Organization must unreservedly encourage these initiatives and actions, which represent a significant contribution to rapprochement and peace among people.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa15">In conclusion I should like to pay tribute to a great sportsman who has just passed away, a man who devoted his life to the development of athletics, first in his own country, Italy, then at the global level, starting in 1981, as President of the International Federation of Amateur Athletics, headquartered in Monaco. President Primo Nébolio passed away on 6 November 1999 at the age of 76. He will leave his profound imprint on the history of sports, reflecting an exemplary career that he began as a long-jump champion and that he pursued at the university level and then worldwide. Indeed, he was the architect of the International Federation of University Sports, whose presidency he held for a long time. In 1992 he became President of the Italian Athletics Federation, an office he held for over 20 years, thus holding both national and international offices, since he was also a highly valued member of the International Olympic Committee.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk06-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Argentina to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/54/L.35</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk07">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Petrella</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa01">I take great satisfaction in introducing, on behalf of the members of the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic, the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/L.35</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa02">Ever since its establishment in 1985, the zone has been a forum for discussion and an arena for building closer cooperative ties and friendship among the African and Latin American countries that border the South Atlantic. Argentina takes pleasure in noting the strides made towards the attainment of the goals established 14 years ago and the flexibility shown in adapting to changes that have occurred in the world since the end of the cold war. It is our view that the zone has been a success because it has allowed countries with differing social and cultural make-ups to give tangible expression to their common goals of peace, social and economic development and environmental protection, within a context of respect for pluralism and diversity. The ongoing vigour and validity of the zone is reflected in the fact that thus far we have held five high-level meetings, the last of which took place in Argentina in October 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa03">In the realm of peace and security, my country takes the view that nuclear-weapon-free zones such as those envisaged in the Treaties of Tlatelolco and Pelindaba, by establishing areas where the use or threat of use of such weapons is prohibited, contribute to the attainment of the goals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa04">As regards illegal arms trafficking and the proliferation of small arms, the countries of the zone are convinced that we must promote the establishment and maintenance of peace and limit as much as possible the extent to which human and economic resources are diverted to weaponry. A clear demonstration of this conviction is the invaluable cooperative initiatives undertaken in recent years by American and African countries.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa05">Given that one of the goals of the zone is the peaceful, negotiated settlement of existing disputes, my country urges all States to act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant United Nations resolutions by focusing their efforts on peacefully, justly and definitively resolving all pending disputes in the South Atlantic. Argentina wishes to once again reaffirm its conviction that the goals of peace and cooperation that are at the heart of the zone can be attained only through the full exercise of representative democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the countries of the region. In this context, we view with satisfaction the progress that has been made this past year towards establishing and consolidating good governance and transparency at the regional level. In addition, my country believes that issues involving peace and development are interdependent and inseparable. This explains the importance of our fostering investment and technical, economic and commercial cooperation among the members of the zone. For this reason, we view with satisfaction the progress made by the member States in attaining economic stability, modernizing State administration and opening their markets.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa06">The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea establishes a regulatory framework for protecting living marine resources. However, some of the Convention's provisions need to be complemented by those in the Fish Stocks Agreement, which was adopted in 1995 and whose entry into force is essential.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa07">Another issue to which Argentina would like to draw attention is the transportation of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes. In this connection, I wish to express the concern of my country and of other South Atlantic coastal States about the risks entailed in the navigation of vessels carrying such wastes.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa08">The fight against drug trafficking and other related crimes requires a concerted effort on the part of the international community. In this regard, Argentina reaffirms its readiness to cooperate to attain the objectives that the zone set for itself at Somerset West in 1996 and in Buenos Aires in 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa09">As regards international humanitarian assistance, I would like to stress the progress made under the "White Helmets" initiative, which was unanimously adopted by the General Assembly in 1994. Within the zone, the White Helmets have assisted communities as diverse as those in Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone, among others.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa10">I cannot conclude without expressing our appreciation of the generous offer made by the Republic of Benin to host the sixth high-level meeting of the members of the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa11">Allow me to refer briefly to several technical aspects of the draft resolution. First, I would like to add to the list of sponsors the delegations of Cape Verde and Equatorial Guinea. I thank for the valuable support they provide by co-sponsoring the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa12">With the goal of improving the quality of the text, and after having engaged in the relevant consultations, I would like to propose, on behalf of the sponsors, two oral revisions to operative paragraph 10. These procedural revisions do not alter the content of the paragraph; they are designed only to emphasize that the parties must fully implement the Lomé Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk07-pa13">The first proposal is to change a few words in the third line of operative paragraph 10. Currently, in the English text, these words are</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk08-pa01">Similarly, I propose that the order of the next to last and the last phrases of operative paragraph 10 be inverted, so that the reference to the President of Togo, to the Economic Community of West African States and to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sierra Leone appears right after the phrase referring to the Lomé Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk08-pa02">If I may, in order to make this clearer I will read what the revised English version of operative paragraph 10 would be. It would now read as follows:</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I would also like to highlight that in operative paragraph 18 a word has been left out which was in the text that the sponsors submitted. I would therefore like to draw delegations' attention to the fact that in the third line of that paragraph, after the word "States", the word "and" needs to be restored, so that in English the third line would read as follows:</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Esaw</span> <span class="nation">Togo</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa01">Fourteen years after its creation, it is clear that the international community now considers the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic to be a valuable mechanism that provides its members with a framework for joint action aimed at achieving the shared goals of peace, economic and social development and environmental protection. The General Assembly's annual consideration of this item and the broad-based support for the resolutions adopted under it bear witness to the positive contribution that the zone can make to the task of implementing the principles and purposes of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa02">The delegation of Togo, which associates itself fully with the introductory statement made by the Permanent Representative of Argentina, cannot fail to congratulate the Secretary-General for the report he has submitted for our consideration in accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-34.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 53/34</a>. We note with satisfaction that specific action is being taken in the United Nations system, eloquent proof of the tireless support that the Organization has always offered to the States members of the zone in order to help them fully to implement our goals.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa03">It is now quite clear that the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic offers immense potential that could be put to good use by the United Nations in its unflagging efforts to build a world of peace focused on development. As a priority framework for cooperation between 24 African and Latin American countries on the Atlantic Ocean, the zone has extended its field of action to issues as basic and varied as the promotion of peace and security and the protection of the environment and marine biological resources.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa04">My delegation considers, however, that if we are to achieve a significant level of efficiency, the efforts of States members of the zone should focus on the priority areas of disarmament, protection of the marine environment and its resources and combating drug trafficking. Moreover, the areas of activity I have mentioned were amply covered by the Final Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at the fifth meeting of the States members of the zone in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 21 and 22 October 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa05">With respect to nuclear disarmament in particular, it is good to note that the zone already has important international instruments to promote the denuclearization of the South Atlantic. The adoption of the Tlatelolco and Pelindaba Treaties was another milestone towards the achievement of that objective. Furthermore, the prospects for a nuclear-weapon-free southern hemisphere is no longer a pious wish, given that the denuclearization of the South Pacific through the Treaties of Rarotonga and Bangkok is proceeding along precisely the same lines. In this respect, I wish to point to the recent activities of the Department for Disarmament Affairs concerning the zone, which are aimed at hastening the entry into force of the Treaties of Tlatelolco and Pelindaba and will certainly contribute to the achievement of their goal.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa06">With respect to small arms and light weapons, their destabilizing effects in the zone hardly need be pointed out. It can never be stressed too firmly that the distribution of small arms and light weapons is largely responsible for igniting armed conflict and a catalyst of transnational organized crime and drug trafficking. That is why my delegation wishes yet again to highlight the need for the United Nations to increase its assistance to the States members of the zone in these areas, particularly through the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Bretton Woods institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa07">In this context, my country welcomed the convening by the Department for Disarmament Affairs of two seminars on the illicit circulation of light weapons under the auspices of the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean and Peace and Disarmament in Africa. Through the head of the Togolese delegation at this session of the General Assembly, we have already expressed our unwavering support for the decision of the United Nations to convene on international conference on all types of illicit weapons trading.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa08">With regard to transnational organized crime and the traffic in and use of drugs, the cooperation emerging between the members of the zone should continue to be supported by the joint action of the international community. In this respect, we welcome the work under way to draft a convention against transnational organized crime and would wish to see the ad hoc committee established to that end achieving concrete results as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa09">My delegation also believes that the protection of the environment -- the marine environment in particular -- is of special importance to the members of the zone. Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area, which is linked to their low level of technological development, the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area, including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing, which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa10">The member States of the zone, without doubt, are aware that they are primarily responsible for taking the appropriate measures for the regulation of the transport of dangerous waste and the intensification of information exchanges regarding fishing fleets that frequently plunder the Atlantic.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa11">Nevertheless, there is an important role to be played by the United Nations system in the framework of solidifying the objectives of the zone concerning these particular aspects. The need for the international community to support, through concrete actions, the member States of the zone in the pursuit of their efforts for the creation of a future secure area, a condition sine qua non of sustainable development, is clearly reflected in <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/54/L.35</a>, of which my country is a sponsor and which was just introduced to us by the representative of Argentina.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk05-pa12">Togo hopes that this draft resolution will enjoy the broad support of the General Assembly, as have corresponding resolutions in the past.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Preware</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I wish to express the appreciation of the Nigerian delegation to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive and insightful report on this agenda item. The zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic has been recognized by the international community as a valuable mechanism that provides the 24 countries from the two shores of the South Atlantic with an important framework for concerted efforts in the pursuit of the common goal of peace, social and economic development and protection of the environment.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The Nigerian Government attaches great importance to the issues of peace, security and development, as set out in the Final Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at the fifth ministerial meeting, held in Buenos Aires in October 1998. The Final Declaration correctly identifies the priority targets of denuclearization, conflict resolution and combating illicit drug trafficking.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Member States of the zone seek a South Atlantic free of nuclear weapons. The Treaties of Pelindaba and Tlatelolco represent a significant move towards the realization of that goal. Brazil's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) means that all States in the zone now subscribe to this very important Treaty. These Treaties, as well as those of Rarotonga, Bangkok and the Antarctic have turned half of the globe into a nuclear-free zone. This is a welcome development. Tremendous progress has also been achieved in recent times in the efforts to prevent the dumping of radioactive and hazardous waste. We therefore call upon the nuclear-weapon States to respect the desire of the peoples of the southern hemisphere to keep the threat of nuclear weapons out of their zone.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">My delegation is pleased with the progress made in the zone in fostering regional peace and cooperation through enhanced understanding and political and socio-economic contacts. We take great satisfaction in the progress made in the past year in the resolution of some conflict situations in our zone which would have posed continuing threats to peace and stability. We are pleased that in our part of the zone in Africa we have seen the restoration of peace and democracy in Sierra Leone and in Liberia, where the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) subregional Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) played a most significant role. The signing of the Peace Agreement between the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front was certainly a most welcome development. We now call on all parties to this Agreement to abide by their commitment and to effectively and fully implement the Agreement. The establishment of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) is a landmark development in the search for durable peace in the subregion. Nigeria stands ready to play an active role in UNAMSIL to facilitate implementation of the Lomé accord.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">We note the commitment of the provisional Government of Guinea-Bissau to hold legislative and presidential elections soon, and we call upon the provisional Government, as well as member States, to support the economic reconstruction and consolidation of democracy in Guinea-Bissau.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Nigeria remains concerned at the increase in drug trafficking and money laundering in our zone. The perpetrators of these illegal activities penetrate and corrupt administrative structures of Governments and financial institutions, all to the detriment not only of national economies but also of the moral fabric of society. Nigeria has been a victim, but it is determined to rid itself of this plague. It will continue to support international efforts to eliminate the related scourges of drugs, money laundering and corruption. We wish to register our appreciation for the tremendous assistance Nigeria has received from the United Nations Drug Control Programme in the formulation and implementation of our National Drug Control Master Plan. The effort is already yielding very positive results. The level of success already achieved is evident in the fact that a growing number of drug traffickers now deliberately avoid Nigerian ports.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">Member States of the zone are conscious of the dangers posed to the peace and security of the region by the proliferation of small arms. Nigeria welcomes the adoption in November 1997 of the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials. The decision taken at the last summit of the Organization of African Unity reinforces the commitment to fight the proliferation, circulation and illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">We also welcome the initiatives by ECOWAS to conclude an agreement on a moratorium on the import, export and manufacture of light weapons. Nigeria is taking practical steps in the fight against the proliferation of illegal arms. Some of the measures already taken include entering into bilateral agreements with contiguous States to check illicit traffic in small arms, the inclusion of locally manufactured weapons in the licensing of small arms and the maintenance of a register of manufacturers that includes local arms producers.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">My delegation would like to take this opportunity to express once again our appreciation to the Government of Argentina for hosting the high-level meeting of the zone in Buenos Aires in 1998. We would also like to thank the Argentine delegation, as well as other members of the Bureau of the Permanent Committee of the zone in New York, for their efforts in coordinating the various activities.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Moura</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">My delegation attaches great importance to the adoption by the General Assembly of a draft resolution on the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">This annual exercise reflects the recognition by the international community of the zone as a valuable mechanism which provides the 24 countries from the two shores of the South Atlantic with an important framework for concerted efforts in the pursuit of the common goals of peace and development.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">The support received by the General Assembly resolutions on this initiative is indicative of the fact that the zone's relevance is not limited to its member States, but that it has a significant impact on the promotion of the objectives of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Brazil believes that, among others, there are three areas in which the zone's potential can be promptly put to use: denuclearization of the region, protection of the marine environment and cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking. There can be no doubt that the goal of complete denuclearization of the South Atlantic region is achievable. The Treaties of Tlatelolco and Pelindaba already provide a basic frame of reference for this endeavour. With Brazil's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), all member States of the zone are now parties to this Treaty. The zone constitutes another building block, together with the Treaties of Tlatelolco, Pelindaba, Rarotonga, Bangkok and the Antarctic, to the fulfilment of the objective of a southern hemisphere free of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Brazil understands that the creation of new mechanisms regarding the protection of the marine environment, within the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, would greatly contribute to the prevention of accidents and would promote the exchange of information and cooperation. The programmes developed by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization represent an important instrument for promoting cooperation among the countries of the zone in that area.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">The fight against drug trafficking is another objective to be actively pursued. Brazil is convinced that coordination of efforts within the zone can be decisive. Agreements among South Atlantic States, as well as multilateral activities, such as the anti-drug initiative launched at the fourth ministerial meeting, held in South Africa, are instrumental in fostering the effectiveness of actions undertaken against this form of organized crime. In this context, we welcome the follow-up given by the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">In order to fully achieve its goals, the zone needs continuing support from the United Nations system, including the United Nations Development Programme and the international financial institutions. The zone's fifth ministerial meeting, held in Buenos Aires in October 1998, once again renewed the commitment of member States to the objectives of the zone. The Final Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at that time set out various modalities of cooperation for the common purpose of ensuring peace, security and development.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">Brazil is committed to working with other South Atlantic countries, as well as with the other members of the international community, to implement the targets set in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, circulated last year as <a href="../pdf/A-53-650.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/650</a>. The Plan of Action encompasses mutually beneficial initiatives that can strengthen cooperation among the member countries, and they should be encouraged.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">As stated by the representative of Nigeria, we are also pleased by the progress made in the resolution of some conflict situations in the zone.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">We appreciate and welcome the offer of the Government of Benin to host the sixth meeting of member States of the zone.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa11">Finally, like the Permanent Representative of Argentina, who introduced the draft resolution before us, we hope that <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/54/L.35</a> will be adopted by consensus.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Coelho Da Cruz</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">It has been 13 years since the zone of peace and cooperation was established, and it has proved to be a forum for dialogue and strengthening of efforts to achieve concrete goals of common interest aimed at promoting South-South cooperation and development among its members.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">One of the priorities of peace is denuclearization and demilitarization. Accordingly, our countries are seeking to transform the South Atlantic into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We support the full implementation of the Pelindaba and Tlatelolco Treaties and the coordination of efforts to promote cooperation between the two continents, as well as to find the best ways and means to put an end to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to the illegal trafficking of small arms and light and conventional weapons. We continue to support the international mine clearance efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Due to the fact that some members have had to devote their energy almost entirely to endeavours to settle their internal conflicts and to achieve national reconciliation, a number of decisions were not fully implemented, particularly regarding the fight against the trafficking of small arms and light weapons, combating drug trafficking, the protection of the marine environment and illegal fishing activities.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">As regards my own country, five years have passed since the signing of the Lusaka Protocol between the Government and UNITA. However, the main tasks in attaining a lasting peace have not yet been achieved, in particular the complete disarming of UNITA and the restoration of State authority in the illegally occupied areas. Also, the intransigence of the rebels led by Mr. Jonas Savimbi in respect of fully honouring their obligations, preferring to take power by force, has plunged the country into a new cycle of violence. Mr. Savimbi is still interested in continuing his destabilizating process of preventing the smooth running of democratic institutions; destroying cities, towns, villages, infrastructure and public and private assets; and mercilessly killing civilians, thereby condemning all the people of Angola to misery, disease and famine.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">As a result of these actions, in addition to the thousands of civilians who have been killed, almost 3 million others have left their original areas in search of shelter in the Government-controlled areas. Those communities require humanitarian assistance by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">Taking into account the great number of refugees and displaced persons, the Government is engaged in a national programme of humanitarian assistance, and it appeals to the international community to continue to provide and increase assistance to the neediest sectors of the population with a view to promoting their resettlement and reintegration into the production and development process.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">The current economic world situation is a cause for great concern for developing countries, and it is vital to seek and to foster new forms of international economic cooperation based on a partnership with reciprocal gains for all the participants. It is within this framework that the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic stands out as the only regional forum for dialogue and closeness between the African and the Latin American countries that wish to strengthen their economic, trade, scientific and technical cooperation without any constraints or unilateral decisions.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">Protection of the marine environment, preservation of South Atlantic living resources and efforts against narcotic traffic are also areas of cooperation to which our countries are giving priority.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">Considering the lack of adequate resources to fully implement all those endeavours, my delegation strongly appeals to the specialized agencies of the United Nations and relevant organizations to give appropriate assistance to Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">The member States of the zone urge all Member States to vote in favour of <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/54/L.35</a>.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Amehou</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">It is a most agreeable duty for me to take the floor on behalf of the delegation of Benin in the debate on the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Before continuing, my delegation would like to congratulate the Secretariat on the report contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-447.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/447</a>, which contains very useful information that I am sure will add substance to our discussions.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">My country, the Republic of Benin, welcomes the establishment of the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic, which is a valuable mechanism providing 24 countries on both shores of the South Atlantic with an important framework for action and for concerted cooperation, sharing as we do the goals of peace, economic and social development and the protection of the environment.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">My delegation would like to take this occasion to congratulate the Government of Argentina on having hosted the fifth ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires, on 21 and 22 October 1998, which adopted by consensus a Final Declaration and Plan of Action, which is a very important document for our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">The Declaration stresses the determination to increase cooperation in fields where our interests coincide, such as preserving fishing resources, developing trade, investment and technical cooperation, conserving our freshwater resources and drafting suitable regulations for the transport of radioactive waste by sea.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">The zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic must be spared an arms race, and above all it must remain free of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">In this respect, the delegation of Benin welcomes the existence on the two shores of the South Atlantic of the Treaties of Pelindaba and Tlatelolco, two important frameworks for the denuclearization of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">Benin attaches great importance to peace in the zone because peace is the only guarantee for fruitful cooperation between Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">However, we have to note that our organization still has to face conflict situations, even within the territory of some of its member States. This is caused by intolerance and long-standing political intransigence on the part of forces opposed to lasting democratic development in our countries, and is compounded by major concerns in connection with the phenomenon of globalization.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">But in the post-cold-war world and given the phenomenon of globalization, which is marked by interference of interests and clashes of interests, the challenges we must meet to safeguard peace and prosperity for humanity are more than ever challenges that we must all face and deal with together.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa11">This is eloquent proof, if any were needed, that the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic is worthwhile, both as an instrument for South-South cooperation and as a forum to promote peace and international security.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa12">My delegation would like to appeal to all member States of the zone to support the processes of peace and reconciliation under way in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa13">Through our joint efforts, we must restore peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea. If it is to fully achieve its goals, the zone needs continuing support from United Nations bodies, particularly the United Nations Development Programme and the international financial institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa14">Finally, I should like to reiterate, on behalf of the Government of Benin, the commitment we made at the third ministerial meeting of members of the zone, held in Brasilia in 1994, to host in Benin the sixth ministerial meeting of our organization. Benin hopes to benefit from the support and experience of countries that have previously hosted meetings of the zone and from all member States for the holding of the sixth ministerial meeting, which will be the first of the next millennium.</p>
