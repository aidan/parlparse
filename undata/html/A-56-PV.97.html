	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa01">On behalf of the Interim Administration of Afghanistan, I would like to express profound gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his recent appeal for emergency humanitarian assistance for the victims of the tragic earthquake in northern Afghanistan on the night of 25-26 March 2002.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa02">The earthquake, which struck the district of Nahrin, in the northern Afghan province of Baghlan, south of the city of Kunduz, has left a long trail of destruction and extensive human loss among the local population of the city and surrounding villages. According to the latest reports received from Afghanistan, the death toll presently stands at about 2,000, with approximately 600 bodies recovered; while another 4,000 persons have been reported severely injured. Estimates also indicate that the quake has left as many as 20,000 civilians homeless.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk05-pa03">I would like to express my appreciation to those Member States, international relief organizations and aid agencies that have responded promptly to provide the victims with emergency supplies. I wish to seize this opportunity to reiterate the appeal made earlier by the Interim Administration of Afghanistan for emergency international assistance to the thousands of civilians in dire need of help to recuperate. I should like to suggest that all Governments intending to assist Afghanistan at this tragic time establish contact with the Ministry of the Interior of the Interim Administration of Afghanistan through the Office of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), located in Kabul.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa01">I have the honour to present the report of the Third Committee under agenda item 117, entitled "Elimination of racism and racial discrimination", which is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-56-581.pdf">A/56/581</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa02">Under this item, the Third Committee, in section III, paragraph 28, of its report, recommends the adoption of four draft resolutions. In paragraph 29 of the same report, the Committee recommends the adoption of one draft decision.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa03">I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to several corrections that should be made to the report.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa04">In section II, paragraph 8 (a), of the report, regarding the replacement of the sixth preambular paragraph of draft resolution A/C.3/56/L.83/Rev.1, the words "outcome of the", which appear in the first line immediately before "World Conference", should be deleted, as should the words ", held from 31 August to 8 September 2001 at Durban, South Africa,". The paragraph thus reads:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa05">"Welcoming that the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance urged States and the international community to support the activities of the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination,".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa06">Therefore, in section III of the report, the sixth preambular paragraph of draft resolution I, which is found on page 29 of the English text, should also read as follows:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa07">"Welcoming that the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance urged States and the international community to support the activities of the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa08">Turning back to section II of the report, in paragraph 14, in the list of the results of the voting on draft resolution A/C.3/56/L.84/Rev.1, which is entitled "Comprehensive implementation of the outcome of and follow-up to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance", Cuba should be inserted between Croatia and Cyprus as having voted in favour of the draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa09">Lastly, also in section II of the report, in paragraph 19, in the narrative dealing with draft resolution A/C.3/56/L.85/Rev.1, entitled "Measures to combat contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance", after the words "submitted by the sponsors of draft resolution A/C.3/56/L.85", the following phrase should be inserted:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg002-bk04-pa10">"as well as Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk04-pa11">I commend this report to the General Assembly for its consideration.</div>

	Mr. Kennedy (United States)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa01">The United States is committed to the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, both within the United States and around the world. Our national experience shows that this battle is a long one, one that requires a strong, unequivocal commitment. Our commitment is reflected in the comprehensive national report we made last year in Geneva to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa02">One part of our fight as a world community is the fight against anti-Semitism. This ugly phenomenon led to the most devastating genocide in modern times, yet we still see its existence throughout the world. A civilized society must guard against this or any ideology that attempts to denigrate one group of people; that leads to hatred, exclusion and violence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa03">As is well known, the United States withdrew from the World Conference against Racism in Durban and, accordingly, was not part of the agreement to adopt the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. In our view, the Conference placed inappropriate and unacceptable focus on a single country-specific situation that was, and remains, totally irrelevant to the subject matter of the Conference.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Particularly at this moment, when it is critically important to make every effort to reduce the violence in the Middle East and guide the conflicting parties back to the negotiating table, the international community should not assess disproportionate blame on any one side in the dispute. In fact, in the Fifth Committee, we had strongly advocated a short delay in funding the Programme of Action in order to give the parties in the region time to work out a ceasefire and a way back to the negotiating table. Also in the Fifth Committee, my delegation proposed asking for an interim report from the Office of Internal Oversight Services -- a report that had been requested when this body adopted the budget resolution last December -- so that we might be better informed before making a decision to provide an additional $500,000 to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights in Geneva.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa05">In our view, the Durban Conference deviated from its original stated purpose of crafting positive, forward-looking solutions to contemporary racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. We are also mindful that the Conference was accompanied in the streets of Durban by some of the worst examples of hate and intolerance witnessed in many decades.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa06">The United States has additional concerns about this draft resolution, namely, those paragraphs that will require an increased expenditure of funds from the regular budget of the United Nations and which place significant added pressure on the budget agreement of last December to set the biennium regular budget level at $2.625 billion -- a level that is already being questioned -- as it strives to provide efficient and effective services to Member States. The draft resolution calls for additional funds to be allocated towards the operation of an anti-discrimination unit in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the establishment of a body of five eminent persons to monitor the implementation of the Durban documents. Because we do not agree to the establishment of either body, we continue to object to the Third Committee's approval of these mechanisms and this draft resolution and to the Fifth Committee's approval of $500,000 of United Nations regular budget funding for them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa07">For the foregoing reasons, the United States must vote against the adoption of draft resolution II. Nevertheless, make no mistake that the United States remains committed to the goals which the Conference was initially established to fulfil: to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Our position is simply that, in this struggle, we must keep our focus clear and never again allow a conference on racism to typify in some respects the very opposite of its original aims and objectives.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa01">When this matter was before the Third Committee, Canada gave an explanation of vote and when it came before the Fifth Committee, Canada gave an explanation of position. We take up this issue for the third time because we consider it essential to do so. We will be obliged to do so each and every time resolutions and decisions of the United Nations call for the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in their entirety. This is precisely the situation we face today with the draft resolutions under agenda item 117 that call for the implementation of the outcome of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa02">Canada went to Durban to address important issues of racism with the international community. We were deeply disappointed. The Conference was inexcusably marred by unacceptable references to the Middle East. Canada regrets that the Conference did not focus on its noble objectives. We regret that the time and energy that should have been dedicated to the eradication of racism were squandered.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Canada chose to stay at the Conference until its conclusion in order to exert positive influence on its proceedings and to unequivocally condemn attempts to delegitimize the State of Israel and to dishonour the history and suffering of the Jewish people. We wish to reiterate here today once again that Canada dissociates itself integrally from all references in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action directly or indirectly relating to the Middle East.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa04">As we stated at the conclusion of the Conference and during the negotiations of the draft resolution before us, any process, declaration or language presented in any form that does not serve to advance a negotiated peace that will bring security, dignity and respect to the people of the region is unacceptable. We also disassociate ourselves from any language that can be construed as welcoming, endorsing or encouraging the implementation of the provisions of the World Conference against Racism Declaration and Programme of Action that Canada did not agree to at Durban.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa05">In our statement in Durban, we also disagreed with the manner in which some issues of the past and grounds of discrimination were addressed in the Conference outcome documents. We regret the inclusion without agreement, in fact, of an inappropriate footnote on gender. Canada also regrets that we were unable to maintain the agreement endorsed in Durban on the use of the term "indigenous peoples" in the resolutions on measures to combat racism. It is our view that this draft resolution is directly based on the outcome documents of the World Conference against Racism. Therefore, we should have used the agreed language from Durban, including explanatory paragraph 24.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa06">That said, we believe that the outcome documents contain helpful language in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. We are particularly encouraged by the recognition of the situation faced by indigenous peoples, as well as by the attention which the outcome documents pay to the concept of multiple discrimination, the role of youth, the media, the Internet and globalization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa07">Canada is strongly and sincerely committed to the eradication of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and all discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, descent, religion or language. Canada remains fully committed to the fight against racism and will use the positive measures contained in the Durban outcome documents, as well as the whole range of anti-racism strategies developed by multilateral organizations, in our continuing efforts to eradicate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa08">However, as I have stated, Canada continues to have serious concerns about the Durban process as well as its outcome documents. This is why Canada will abstain in the voting on draft resolution II before us today.</div>

I am pleased to announce that since the publication of the draft resolution, the following countries have become sponsors: Angola, Belarus, Bolivia, Canada, Cape Verde, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Georgia, the Gambia, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Peru, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Ukraine and Venezuela.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk13-pa02">On 14 December 2001, the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-96.pdf">resolution 56/96</a>, entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies". The fact that 118 Member States sponsored that resolution was a vivid demonstration of the international community's support for the efforts of Governments to promote or consolidate democratization in their own countries and globally.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk13-pa03">In that resolution, the General Assembly welcomed, inter alia, the decision of the Government of Mongolia to host the Fifth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies in 2003. I wish to take this opportunity to express once again to all Member States the appreciation of my Government for their valuable support with respect to the hosting of that important and prestigious conference in Mongolia.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk13-pa04">Mongolia is most honoured to host the Conference. The offer to host it is connected to a strong belief in the immense creative potential of popular participation, good governance and democratic rules. Exchanges of views and experiences in democratic transformations will be useful for all who are willing to develop or consolidate democratization in their countries and internationally and who are committed to doing so.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk13-pa05">It goes without saying that in order to make the Conference a success, organizational and substantive preparations should start without delay. Both organizers and participants need to work closely together to ensure a successful outcome. Therefore, in order to allow Member States and international, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to start their preparations in good time, it is proposed that the General Assembly fix the date of the Conference.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk13-pa06">Furthermore, as in previous similar cases, the draft resolution invites the Secretary-General, Member States and the relevant specialized agencies and bodies of the United Nations system, as well as other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the intergovernmental follow-up mechanism to the Fourth International Conference, held at Cotonou, to give all possible support to and actively cooperate with the preparations for the Ulaanbaatar Conference.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa01">The Group of 77 and China have expressed their concern with respect to the implementation of the measures announced by the Secretary-General in his note verbale of 28 February 2002 and in information circular ST/IC/2002/13, which has to a large extent violated General Assembly resolutions on the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 and on the calendar of conferences, and because it has had an fundamental impact on Member States, on the functioning of the regional groups and, specifically, that of the Group of 77 and China, and on the functioning of the Organization itself.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa02">In its relevant resolutions, the General Assembly has rejected proposals to reduce services directly affecting Member States and regional groups, specifically conference services and the functioning of substantive departments, including the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services. The Group of 77 and China are concerned also about the negative impact of reaching certain arbitrary budget levels on United Nations activities and programmes mandated by Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa03">The Group of 77 and China believe also that these measures ignore the importance and validity of current procedures and practices for the provision of conference services, services to Member States and other services covered in the Secretary-General's note verbale but which must be provided to Member States, to the General Assembly and its Main Committees and to regional groups. Such services are vital to the efficiency and success of the work of such groups and bodies and are essential to the work of the Organization as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa04">The measures hastily implemented three months into a two-year budget exercise, without the approval of the General Assembly and against the general wishes of the membership of the Organization, have resulted in a reduction in conference services, making it impossible for a number of bodies to conclude their programmes of work, and causing the unanticipated postponement of meetings and the convening of meetings without the minimum requirements such as audio, interpretation and air conditioning or in buildings outside Headquarters. It has further prevented the adoption of decisions in line with the calendar of conferences and has caused the cancellation of several meetings of the Group of 77 and China -- whose functioning has, in practice, been hampered and limited.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa05">The Group of 77 and China submitted a Fifth Committee draft resolution on this subject because of the lack of an adequate response to their repeated requests for the restoration of suspended services, especially conference services for committees, other bodies and regional groups and Internet support for missions. The Group of 77 and China attach particular importance to the draft resolution just adopted as <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-56-254">resolution 56/254</a> D, with respect to envisaged cuts in a number of services vital to Member States and to the implementation of General Assembly resolutions 56/253, 56/254 and 56/242. We hope that the Secretariat will implement the resolution comprehensively and without delay.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa06">Adopted following an intensive process of negotiations, the resolution notes with concern the implementation of cutback measures and their effect on services provided to Member States. It requests the Secretary-General to implement resolutions on the budget and on conference services in such a way as to avoid averse effects on Member States. Of special importance are the paragraphs calling for the provision of adequate conference services to organs, committees and regional groups pursuant to resolutions on the pattern of conferences and for minimizing the adverse effect of any changes in the existing and established practice with respect to the provision and availability of conference servicing. Further, the resolution would restore immediately Internet services to permanent missions, using the approximately $750,000 released as a result of the suspension on an exceptional basis of honorariums payable to members of the International Law Commission, the International Narcotics Control Board, the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the Child as of 6 April.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa07">That was not the ideal solution for the Group of 77 and China, but it was the only possible way at least to restore Internet services in the face of the absence of acceptable proposals by the Secretariat on a resolution of that matter within the framework of the budget. The Group of 77 and China hope that the Secretariat's proposals to the General Assembly next May will permit comprehensive implementation of the provisions of resolution on the pattern of conferences within the framework of resources approved for the 2002-2003 budget, and will make it possible to restore conference services to committees, other bodies and regional groups, and in particular to the Group of 77 and China.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa08">In the resolution we have just adopted, the General Assembly further decides that, in the context of the first performance report on the budget at the fifty-seventh session, special attention be focused on the restoration of all necessary services to Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa09">If the situation and the unfortunate climate created in the Organization by the implementation of these measures persist, the Group of 77 and China and regional groups will be prevented from making a positive contribution to preparations for forthcoming summits and other United Nations meetings. That would be unacceptable in the light of the international and multilateral nature of the Organization and the equal rights of all Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk20-pa10">The Group of 77 and China hope therefore that the Secretariat will find other ways to implement the budget cuts that will not be at the expense of Member States or of the resolutions of the General Assembly. We know this can be done within the framework of budgetary procedures and that measures affecting the functioning of the Main Committees, of other bodies and of regional groups, including the Group of 77 and China, can be rescinded as soon as possible, which is indispensable for the efficiency and success of the work of the Organization.</div>
