	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk06-pa02">Members will recall that, by its decision 48/321 of 14 February 1994, the General Assembly, pursuant to its <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-48-141">resolution 48/141</a> of 20 December 1993, approved the appointment of Mr. José Ayala Lasso of Ecuador as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for a four-year term of office beginning on 28 February 1994.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk06-pa03">By a letter dated 20 February 1997, Mr. Ayala Lasso informed the Secretary-General of his decision to resign as High Commissioner effective 15 March 1997.

	Mr. Sáenz Biolley (Costa Rica)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa01">I wish to refer to document <a href="../pdf/A-51-924.pdf">A/51/924</a>, "Human rights questions: Approval of the appointment of the High Commissioner for Human Rights", under agenda item 110, "Human rights questions", as contained in the note by the Secretary-General that has been distributed to us.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Reference is made in this document to <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-48-141">General Assembly resolution 48/141</a> of 20 December 1993, by which the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was created. Paragraph 1 (a) of the note describes the qualities of the person to assume that position, which include high moral standing and personal integrity; expertise, including in the field of human rights; and the general knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures necessary for impartial, objective, non-selective and effective performance of the duties of the High Commissioner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Paragraph 1 (b) then indicates that the High Commissioner shall be appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and approved by the General Assembly, with due regard to geographical rotation, and have a fixed term of four years with a possibility of one renewal for another fixed term of four years.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa04">In this context, Costa Rica is extremely surprised that, in the case before us, geographical rotation has not been taken duly into account, particularly in the case of the candidate proposed by my country, Ambassador Sonia Picado, and endorsed by the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. This is so not only because of the merits of the candidate, a recipient of a United Nations human rights award in 1993, but also because the Latin American and Caribbean region has been proposing since 1952 -- at that time through the delegation of Uruguay -- the establishment of the post of United Nation High Commissioner for Human Rights. Subsequently, my country in 1964 proposed the establishment of the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights. This initiative was put on hold for almost 30 years, until the Latin American and Caribbean regional preparatory conference -- which happened to be held in San José, the capital of my country, at the initiative of the Government of Costa Rica -- for the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights adopted a recommendation addressed to the Vienna Conference requesting it to recommend to the General Assembly, as a matter of high priority, the creation of the post of High Commissioner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa05">As members are aware, the General Assembly adopted <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-48-141">resolution 48/141</a>, entitled "High Commissioner for the promotion and protection of all human rights". On that basis, a successful working group was established under the wise leadership of the then Permanent Representative of the Republic of Ecuador, Ambassador José Ayala Lasso. That group defined and made recommendations on the legal, conceptual and institutional framework for the work of the High Commissioner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa06">It was with great pleasure and in recognition of the skills of Ambassador José Ayala Lasso of Ecuador that we welcomed his appointment by the Secretary-General to discharge that mandate. Nonetheless, for reasons that are known to all, he did not conclude even the first of the two terms of office that, in accordance with the resolution, it was foreseeable that he would hold.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa07">Moreover, it has to be said that the actual presence of such an important region of the world as Latin America and the Caribbean at the highest levels of the United Nations is not commensurate with the geographical balance that constitutes the very essence of the Organization. Furthermore, on the subject of human rights, our countries have also gone through a difficult and often painful process in their transition to democracy and in the quest for fundamental human rights, a process that resulted in sad and tragic episodes but also taught valuable lessons that can and should be shared with other parts of the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa08">We have also maintained that the fact that Costa Rica was for almost 30 years the proponent and defender of the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights -- until this effort bore fruit in 1993 -- conferred special significance on a candidate from a country that has become the symbol of an institutional life and a foreign policy that are imbued with a commitment to human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa09">That is why we are deeply surprised at the recommendation made by the Secretary-General in the note we have before us. This decision disregards my country's background in this respect. It does not take into account the merits of the Costa Rican candidate; it disregards the principles of rotation and balance in geographical representation; it ignores the endorsement of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States; and it does not take into consideration the well-thought-out position of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Group of 77 and China.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This is of particular concern in the context of the reform of the United Nations, and we would not wish to suppose this to be a sign of a future line of action that would aim to shift the developing countries away from posts of high importance in the system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa11">We recognize that the Secretary-General has the authority to appoint the person that he wishes, and he has proposed Her Excellency Mrs. Mary Robinson, the President of Ireland, as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for a four-year period, not just to complete the term of office of Ambassador Ayala Lasso. The fact that we recognize the merits of the President of the Republic of Ireland does not prevent us from expressing our complete disagreement with the fact that due account was not taken of geographical representation and that an opportunity was denied to a candidate who also has outstanding qualities, which are widely recognized, to continue the mandate of the initial High Commissioner, who came from a Latin American State.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa12">In any event, my country believes that although this is not the best or most appropriate of circumstances, we must thank the fraternal countries of Latin America and the Caribbean for their support, as well as the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and China for their position.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa13">In view of the considerations relating to this nomination, my delegation felt it necessary to put forward these comments so that they could be placed on record for this meeting of the General Assembly on agenda item 110, on the approval of the appointment of the nomination of the High Commissioner for Human Rights proposed by the Secretary-General.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa14">Finally, in these circumstances my delegation will not participate in the decision to be taken in the Assembly on the proposal by the Secretary-General.</div>
