	<div class="p">As was announced at the 59th plenary meeting yesterday, the Assembly will first proceed to a by-election to elect a member of the Economic and Social Council, in accordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure.</div>
	<div class="p">In this connection, I should like to draw the attention of members to document <a href="../pdf/A-58-357.pdf">A/58/357</a>, containing a letter dated 10 September 2003 from the Permanent Representative of Portugal to the United Nations. In his letter, the Permanent Representative of Portugal announces that Portugal would like to relinquish its seat on the Economic and Social Council for the remainder of its term in favour of Turkey.</div>
	<div class="p">As a result, a vacancy will occur and a new member must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired term of office of Portugal, commencing on 1 January 2004 and expiring on 31 December 2005.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account that the vacancy will occur from among the Western European and other States, the new member should therefore be elected from that region.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to inform the Assembly that the candidate which receives a two-thirds majority of members present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote, there will be a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</div>

	<div class="p">Regarding the vacancy, the Chairman of the Group of Western European and other States for the month of November has informed the Secretariat that the Group has endorsed Turkey.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to inform members that, as of 1 January 2004, the following States from the Group of Western European and other States will be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The names of those eight States should therefore not appear on the ballot.</div>
	<div class="p">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</div>

	<div class="p">Ballot papers will now be distributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot papers and to write on them the name of the one State for which they wish to vote.
