	<p id="pg001-bk09-pa01">As was announced at the 59th plenary meeting yesterday, the Assembly will first proceed to a by-election to elect a member of the Economic and Social Council, in accordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk09-pa02">In this connection, I should like to draw the attention of members to <a href="../pdf/A-58-357.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/357</a>, containing a letter dated 10 September 2003 from the Permanent Representative of Portugal to the United Nations. In his letter, the Permanent Representative of Portugal announces that Portugal would like to relinquish its seat on the Economic and Social Council for the remainder of its term in favour of Turkey.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk09-pa03">As a result, a vacancy will occur and a new member must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired term of office of Portugal, commencing on 1 January 2004 and expiring on 31 December 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk09-pa04">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account that the vacancy will occur from among the Western European and other States, the new member should therefore be elected from that region.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk09-pa05">I should like to inform the Assembly that the candidate which receives a two-thirds majority of members present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote, there will be a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>

The names of those eight States should therefore not appear on the ballot.</p>

The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, who receive the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of members present and voting, will be declared elected.
