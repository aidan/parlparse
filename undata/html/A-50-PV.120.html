	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk04-pa01">Members will recall that at its 103rd plenary meeting on 3 April 1996 the Assembly decided to reopen consideration of this agenda item and to consider it directly in plenary meeting.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk04-pa02">In this connection, the Assembly has before it a draft resolution issued as document <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.74.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.74</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk04-pa03">I call on the representative of Ireland to introduce the draft resolution.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Campbell</span><span class="nation">Ireland</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa01">I have the honour to introduce the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.74.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.74</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa02">Under the draft resolution, the General Assembly would increase the number of members of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) by one, to 51 States. The Assembly would also request the Economic and Social Council to elect the additional member at its substantive session of 1996, which begins later this month.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa03">The draft resolution is in conformity with decision 1996/212 of the Economic and Social Council, adopted earlier this year, by which the Council recommended that the Assembly take a decision on this question at its current session.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa04">Both the decision of the Economic and Social Council and the present draft resolution are required to give effect to the request by my Government that Ireland become a member of the UNHCR Programme's Executive Committee. That request was formally conveyed last November in a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland to the Secretary-General, and circulated as a document of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa05">Ireland acceded in 1956 to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. In 1968, Ireland acceded to the 1967 Protocol on the same subject.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa06">Ireland has been supportive of the work of UNHCR over many years. This has been demonstrated most tangibly in its contributions both to UNHCR's general budget and to specific relief operations. In recent years, as an expression of our strong support, our voluntary contributions to UNHCR have been significantly increased. As a result, we are at present the nineteenth largest donor on an absolute basis, and the eleventh largest on a per capita basis.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa07">We have also sought to make a constructive contribution to the operations of UNHCR through participation as an observer in the work of the Executive Committee.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa08">Successive Irish Governments have sought to demonstrate concern for the plight of refugees and solidarity with those countries where there are large number of refugees by serving as a country of asylum, most recently for refugees from countries of the former Yugoslavia. Furthermore, Irish non-governmental relief organizations, with the full support of the Irish Government, have participated in large numbers of UNHCR relief organizations in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Many of these organizations have the highest international reputation.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa09">Taking these factors into consideration, the Irish Government considers that Ireland, through its demonstrated interest in and devotion to the solution of refugee problems, clearly fulfils the requirements for membership of the Executive Committee of the UNHCR Programme, and that it is now appropriate for Ireland to become a member.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg001-bk05-pa10">Accordingly, we trust that the Assembly will adopt this draft resolution by consensus, so that the Economic and Social Council may proceed to the election of Ireland to the Executive Committee at its substantive session later this month.</p>

However, other items, particularly the implementation of the 1996-1997 budget, were also considered.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg002-bk07-pa03">All negotiations on the various items on the agenda took place in informal meetings under the chairmanship -- pursuant to the usual practice of the Committee -- of representatives assigned to the Fifth Committee. It is a pleasure for me now to inform the Assembly that the 28 resolutions and decisions adopted during the second part of the resumed fiftieth session were adopted by consensus, with the exception of the draft resolution on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg002-bk07-pa04">I shall now present a brief report on the work of our Committee.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg002-bk07-pa05">With regard to agenda item 116, "Programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997", the Fifth Committee's report is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-50-842-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/842/Add.3</a>. In paragraph 12 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of four draft resolutions, all of which were adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>

	<p id="docA50PV120-pg002-bk07-pa09">This draft resolution was the subject of lengthy negotiations. At the end of these negotiations, the coordinator reported to the Committee that it had not been possible to reach consensus on that draft resolution. He asked the Chairman of the Committee to consult the Committee on what approach to take. Following a suspension of the meeting, the representative of Lebanon submitted the same draft resolution to the Committee, pursuant to rule 122 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. Following that introduction, the Committee suspended its work in order to consult further on this matter. When the meeting was resumed at the beginning of this week, no agreement had been reached. The Committee was therefore obliged to take a separate vote on paragraph 7 of the draft resolution, which was adopted by 82 votes in favour, 2 against and 2 abstentions. The Committee adopted the draft resolution, as amended, as a whole, by 85 votes in favour, 3 against and 1 abstention.</p>

	<p id="docA50PV120-pg011-bk10-pa01">My delegation would like to state its position with regard to the vote (A/C.5/50/3) presented by the Secretary-General on behalf of the members of the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC). The Syrian Arab Republic would like to confirm its commitment to the provisions relating to respect for the immunities and privileges of officials of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and related organizations.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg011-bk10-pa02">My delegation has been giving its full assistance to United Nations officials under the relevant agreements and conventions. There is no doubt that my country, like any other country that grants these immunities, expects international officials to abide by and not to violate, the terms of the conventions, to respect domestic laws of the host country and to abide by its provisions with regard to national sovereignty. They should refrain from any action that has nothing to do with the nature of their tasks.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV120-pg011-bk10-pa03">My country supports these privileges and immunities, provided that they do not lead to interference in the internal affairs of the countries in which the officials concerned work. <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-47-28.pdf">General Assembly resolution 47/28</a> confirms that all United Nations officials should, in the conduct of their duties, fully observe the laws and regulations of the countries in which they work, in addition to their duties and responsibilities to the Organization.</p>
