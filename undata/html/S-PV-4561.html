<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) has been in operation for nine months now. Over that period, it has focused on reviewing the reports submitted by States on their implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. So far, the CTC has received 160 reports from United Nations Members and from four others. It has completed its review of 127 of these and is working hard to finish reviewing the remainder of the reports received.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">The Committee is also following up with the 29 States that have not yet submitted a report. My letter to the Council on this, which was circulated as <a href="../pdf/S-2002-673.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/673</a>, explained the way in which the CTC planned to do this. Let me reiterate: the CTC and its experts are ready to discuss the submission of a report at any time with States that are having difficulty. I encourage them to make contact with the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">This achievement has been made by a team which has become increasingly experienced by the day. I should like to thank warmly the Vice-Chairmen -- Ambassadors Koonjul, Lavrov and Valdivieso -- for their professional leadership of the subcommittees; and the whole membership of the CTC for their consistent hard work and cooperation. I should like to thank our team of experts, including those who have already completed their tours, for getting to grips with the substance so effectively. I should also like to thank the CTC's secretariat for the support they have given the CTC and its subcommittees.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">The CTC's work programme for the fourth 90-day period was issued as a recent document of the Security Council. The CTC will focus in the coming period on reviewing for a second time the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> in the States that have submitted a further report to the Committee. The States concerned can expect a slightly different letter from the CTC the second time around. We intend to set out more clearly the gaps identified by our experts together with recommendations about the action needed to improve implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>. We will be looking to many States to submit a third report to the Committee setting out their response to these recommendations and including a timetable for action.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">We expect our experts to indicate, where appropriate, how a State might benefit from technical or other assistance. If so, the letter from the CTC will indicate what assistance is a priority -- and what might be required in slower time -- taking account of any request for assistance presented by the State concerned. The letters may make recommendations on which providers could be contacted by the State concerned for help.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">The CTC also intends to be in close contact with potential providers of assistance. Our team of experts will act as a source of encouragement for the provision of assistance in the areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>. We have asked them to inform providers about any trends in the implementation gaps as this information emerges through the review process, with a view to encouraging providers to develop new programmes to meet these needs. They will approach potential providers, with the agreement of the State concerned, to encourage them to react to the particular needs identified by the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">Let me reiterate the Committee's agreed approach: the CTC does not intend to declare any Member State 100 per cent compliant with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>. We believe that there may always be further work to do to meet the objectives of the resolution against a constantly evolving background. We intend to move ahead more intensively with some than with others, but we will want all States to remain in close contact with the Committee and to inform it of any new developments that are relevant to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">In all of that, the CTC will proceed with the transparency and openness that are by now, I hope, a hallmark of our work. I will continue to brief the wider membership of the United Nations on a regular basis on the activities of the Committee. I, the Vice-Chairmen and the experts are available to address the concerns and questions of individual Member States or of regional groups.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa09">The CTC's outreach to international and regional organizations has intensified since my last briefing to the Council. I myself have visited the United Nations Office in Vienna, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to discuss matters covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Bureau met representatives of the Group of Eight in New York earlier this month. The Committee's experts have begun an intensive travel programme -- visiting, for instance, Abu Dhabi, for a conference on hawala; Prague, for an OSCE seminar on terrorist financing; Washington, for contacts with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; Paris, for a meeting with the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering; and other venues. Today one of our experts is in Sofia for a regional meeting of the countries of South-Eastern Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa10">Our message to those regional players is four-fold. They must be determined in dealing with terrorism, and must develop permanent mechanisms for doing so in accordance with their respective mandates. They should use those forums to get together to talk about counter-terrorism on a regional level, because no State is secure from this threat if its neighbour is a backmarker. Many regional organizations are well placed to facilitate the sharing of expertise and best practices within a region, where a common culture and history often makes the transfer of expertise easiest. I would also hope that these organizations will develop their own assistance programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa11">Let me try to set out what the CTC has achieved in its first nine months. Our most important success to date is to have directed very widespread attention to the fact that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> both exists and is a powerful resolution. A broad range of international institutions and regional and subregional organizations are now aware that there is a global structure for countering terrorism, into which they would be well advised to fit their activities. We have also contributed by bringing out the connections between terrorism and other forms of international organized crime. The CTC is not a law-enforcement agency, nor is it working on cases. So, in that sense, we do not have any operational achievements in that sense to report. But we have a strong interest in capacity-building. The fact that the vast majority of Member States are now engaged with us in that exercise and that all States recognize their responsibility to follow up <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is a massive change from the situation that existed when the Committee was formed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa12">There is a further indicator that demonstrates the activity of the international community in this area, and that is the ratifications of the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism. Ratifications have gone up by more than 15 per cent since last July. There are now 14 countries which have ratified all 12 conventions, when on 11 September there were only two, Botswana and my own. The CTC urges all States to continue to bring forward ratification of these instruments. It is a requirement of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, but it also is an indication that States are beginning to build up the network of legislation they need to be able to take effective action.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa13">Let me end with an update of where we are with practical support from the Secretariat. I am most grateful to the Fifth Committee for allowing the Secretariat flexibility in meeting the demands placed by the Committee. I hope this will soon translate into an immediate improvement in the speed of the translation of documents and the servicing of meetings. The United Nations membership as a whole has confirmed time and again the priority it places on action against terrorism and the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. I urge the Secretariat to reflect that priority in the allocation of resources.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa14">My next report to the Council will mark the year-point since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the establishment of the CTC. The Vice-Chairmen, other Committee members and I are determined to ensure that the Committee's story at its first birthday is one of the United Nations translating international determination to deal with a global threat into effective action encompassing all our Governments. The Security Council should at that point have a well-prepared debate about our objectives in this field in the Committee's second year.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his comprehensive briefing.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahbubani</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">This morning my staff had a meeting to discuss what I should say at this morning's session. The instructions they gave to me were that I should give a very short speech based on three Cs. The three Cs are commend, commitment and criteria. But after having a discussion with Ambassador Greenstock on the way in, I thought I would add a question or two after the three Cs.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">First, with regard to commending, I think there is no doubt that we have a lot for which to commend the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and, of course, its Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock. My only concern is that Sir Jeremy might receive so much praise today that he will not know how to handle it in the course of day-to-day events. But, most important, he has shown that United Nations committees  which are often perceived, as we know, to be toothless entities  can actually make a difference. There is no doubt that the CTC has made a significant difference since it was set up. But we also want to commend the rest of the team, including the three Vice-Chairmen  Ambassadors Koonjul, Lavrov and Valdivieso. I know that the three of them have also had to chair very long meetings and go through piles of reports. At the same time, I wish to commend all the experts and the other staff who have been involved in this exercise. So there is a lot of commendation to be provided.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">The second C is commitment. In that regard, we want to declare once again that Singapore is fully committed to the fight against terrorism. As members are aware, we came close to experiencing a terrorist attack ourselves some time ago; so we are committed to doing whatever we can. Also in this regard, I would like to add that we are also committed to sharing our expertise with others, including our colleagues in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). For example, to enhance the capabilities of ASEAN member States in the fight against terrorism, Singapore has offered logistical support for training in various aspects of anti-terrorism skills that will strengthen the national mechanisms of ASEAN member States to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">I believe that my colleague from ASEAN will be speaking later today  and of course Singapore associates itself fully with the statement to be made on behalf of ASEAN members. By the way, I should also mention here that we are looking at other ways and means of sharing our expertise, not just with the ASEAN region but also with the rest of the Asia-Pacific region as well.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Finally, with regard to the third C, which is criteria, I want to refer to a sentence in Sir Jeremy Greenstock's presentation to us. He said that the CTC did not intend to declare any Member State 100 per cent compliant with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We completely agree that that is the right approach to take. But I think that Member States will be asking themselves the question of how to assess themselves with regard to whether or not they have fulfilled the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and all the demands made of them by the CTC. I therefore wonder whether, in the course of the next three months, the CTC can try to work out some kind of criteria. It may be difficult to create formal criteria, but some kind of informal criteria might be desirable, so that Member States can measure themselves against some sort of benchmarks provided to them by the CTC in trying to do some kind of self-assessment of their performance. I am not sure whether that is doable, but I hope Sir Jeremy Greenstock will reflect on it with his colleagues.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Finally, I have a question or two. I turn to a sentence in Sir Jeremy's presentation, where he said: "The CTC is not a law-enforcement agency, nor is it working on cases." (<i>Supra)</i></p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Sometimes, we compare the Security Council to a fire department that is sent to put out fires whenever conflicts break out. What is the best layman's analogy we could find to describe the nature of the work of the CTC so everyone understands the nature of the beast we are dealing with when we deal with the CTC? I wonder whether Sir Jeremy has any suggestions in that direction.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Finally, I am glad Sir Jeremy mentioned there will be a full debate and discussion in three months' time. It will be very important for the one-year review of the accomplishments of the CTC to have a more extensive debate, with wider participation of all Member States. Clearly, if this fight against terrorism is going to succeed it needs the commitment of 189 -- or by then 191 -- Member States. It is important that they participate in that review. But what would the CTC like them to bring to the table when they come for the discussion? If Sir Jeremy has any thoughts on how Member States can prepare themselves for that very important review, it would be helpful if he wants to plant the seeds now. Certainly it would help my delegation and I hope other delegations as well.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diallo</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Nine months have passed since the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). During that period the CTC has made much praiseworthy effort towards the implementation of the recommendations of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Council meetings of 18 January 2002 and 15 April 2002 enabled us to see the determination of Member States to act decisively to combat terrorism. The submission of 164 reports to date -- the majority of which have already been considered by the Committee, as Ambassador Greenstock mentioned -- eloquently illustrates that determination. The experience acquired by the Committee through consideration of these reports is promising for the coordination of future activities.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">There is no doubt that the Committee, through its work, has in many respects highlighted the connection between terrorism and other forms of organized crime and the existence of a world structure to combat it. We are grateful to the Committee, its Chairman and its support staff for the important milestones they have reached.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The tragic events of 11 September 2001 shed new light on the dangers posed by terrorism because of its many ramifications. We welcome the appointment of two experts on the provision of assistance to States, and we encourage them in the accomplishment of their mission. My delegation views coordination of assistance as a priority, beginning with identifying the type of assistance available with a view to better coordinating it with the needs expressed. In that regard, the contacts already established with potential providers of assistance are encouraging. Strengthening cooperation between the Committee and other international community actors including regional organizations is necessary and greatly benefits Member States. We encourage the ongoing work on the composition of the panel of experts, and we reiterate the need for representation of all regions within the panel. My delegation would also like to emphasize the importance the Committee should attach to consideration of the second reports. We are convinced the outcome will enable Member States to adopt, as appropriate, additional measures to strengthen our common fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">In conclusion, my delegation would like to express its support for the new work programme of the Committee, submitted for our consideration.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Negroponte</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">Nine months after the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), the United States would again like to thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his continued vigorous and committed leadership of the CTC. We would also like to thank the Vice-Chairmen for their contribution as well as the Mission of the United Kingdom, which has a dedicated team of professionals who are supporting the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">From the beginning, Sir Jeremy has insisted on serious and energetic implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and on monitoring by the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We believe he has been imaginative and effective both in building and maintaining consensus within the Committee and in informing Member States of the work and the progress of the CTC. As a result of the efforts of CTC members, experts and the Secretariat, the CTC has largely completed its successful review of the initial reports and is now embarked on the second round of reviews.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">With the second stage of the CTC's work now under way, we reiterate the importance of all States abiding by their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, including submission of timely, responsive and complete reports. Only in that way can we have a benchmark of the world's counter-terrorism capacity. The review of the second round of reports will, to a large extent, determine the level of impact the CTC will have in the fight against terrorism and whether it will be anything more than an ongoing world audit of the capacity of Member States to combat terrorism. The Committee must be prepared to be professionally critical and tough-minded but also constructive. Above all, it needs to focus attention on those States which lack the capacity and/or the will to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. To that end, in its second set of responses to Member States the Committee should identify the gaps in implementation, what each State needs to do to bring itself into compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and what should be each State's priorities. Where a particular State needs technical or other assistance with the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> we believe the CTC should undertake efforts to ensure that such State receives the assistance it needs. We are pleased to see that the CTC informally agreed to such procedures earlier this month. Regardless of how successful the CTC is in identifying the States that lack capacity to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, its ultimate success will in large part be determined by whether those States and organizations that have the resources to help are willing to do so.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">To that end, we urge Member States with the capacity to do so to provide assistance to countries that seek help in full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>. A substantial number of countries capable of providing assistance such as training have yet to list themselves in the CTC directory of assistance providers. Perhaps some of the countries with expertise do not usually think of themselves as potential assistance providers. I have in mind sophisticated financial centres in particular. It would be desirable for such States to consider carefully their capacity to provide assistance such as technical training.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">We are pleased to see that the CTC now has two experts to coordinate its efforts to mobilize States and organizations, to provide assistance and to match those willing to help with those in need. We also agree with the importance that Ambassador Greenstock continues to place on the role regional, subregional and functional organizations can play in the fight against terrorism. Those organizations are well placed to undertake collective efforts to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. They can also assist -- and some have already begun assisting -- the CTC in monitoring the efforts taken by countries in their respective regions to implement the resolution. Thus, we welcome the Committee's intention to encourage these organizations to develop action plans to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and to facilitate the sharing of principles, best practices and expertise within their regions and their areas of competence.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">It is important to remember that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the Committee established to monitor it have no time limits. They will continue until the Security Council is satisfied with the implementation of the resolution. The high level of energy and determination that those involved with the Committee have shown to date will need to be maintained.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">Before closing, I am pleased to report that yesterday the United States deposited with the United Nations the instruments of ratification of the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In so doing, the United States expressed its consent to be bound by those two treaties, the last remaining United Nations anti-terrorism conventions to which it had not yet become a party.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">One of the tangible results of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the work of the Committee has been an increase in momentum among Member States towards ratification of all 12 United Nations anti-terrorism conventions. We hope that this momentum will continue, and we urge all States that have yet to do so to take the steps necessary to ratify those instruments.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kolby</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I too would like to thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his excellent work as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). Norway commends him and the three Vice-Chairmen for their dedicated efforts to implement the tasks assigned to the Committee. We fully share the aims and objectives outlined by him for the Committee's next 90-day working period.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Many States are in the process of finalizing their second reports to the CTC. Norway has recently adopted a legislative package designed to combat terrorist acts and the financing of terrorism. Those measures provide the basis for our second report to the CTC. At the same time, the work of the CTC and its experts, as well as that of other international bodies, has to a large extent inspired the legislative process in our country.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">We remain focused on the need to assist States in their efforts to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. This is a priority for the Committee. Norway and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) recently agreed on a cooperation programme to support the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by OAU member States. This year Norway will make available approximately $210,000 for the project. Norway is also funding a project to support and strengthen cooperation between the countries in the Southern African Development Community in the fight against terrorism in the southern African region.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Norwegian efforts to combat terrorism will continue to be broad based, including political, legal, diplomatic and economic measures. We also consider a strong commitment to development cooperation to be a relevant contribution to combating terrorism by improving socially unjustifiable conditions.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Lajous</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">My delegation wishes to align itself with the statement that will be made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Rio Group. I wish also to refer to some matters of particular interest to my country related to the fight against terrorism, and particularly regarding the role of the Committee established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The creation of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) has given vigorous and unprecedented impetus to the efforts of the international community and the United Nations in combating terrorism. Although it is too early to reach conclusions based on preliminary results, we can say today that the Committee has breathed life and dynamism into its mandate, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. As has been stated on other occasions, there is no doubt that one of its specific contributions is that it has encouraged States to conduct an in-depth analysis of their legal and institutional pillars in order to effectively combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Another positive element stemming from the submission of national reports has been the broad dissemination of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> within States through inter-institutional cooperation in the drafting of every report.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">Recognition for these achievements must be directed also to the creativity of the Committee Chairman, Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, and to the staff members who assist him in the United Kingdom Mission. Mexico also expresses its gratitude to the Vice-Chairmen of the Committee for efficient presiding over the subcommittees. We also congratulate the experts on their effective work in their respective areas. The Secretariat too has contributed to the functioning of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">During the debate last April, my delegation stated that five premises should guide the Committee and the United Nations in its work in combating terrorism. Now that we are on the eve of the second phase, we reaffirm that these premises remain valid.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">My country believes it is essential for the Committee to work through transparency and cooperation. We insist that one central element in combating terrorism is respect for human rights, as well as observance of international law, the Charter of the United Nations in particular.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Perhaps the greatest challenge now facing the Committee is technical and financial assistance for full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is becoming increasingly clear that greater cooperation between countries is required in order to combat terrorism effectively. The dimension of this challenge has a number of aspects that need to be considered. One of them is the close relationship of assistance with compliance with paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Committee has succeeded in getting the great majority of Member States to comply by submitting reports. As for the States that have not yet done so, the Committee could cooperate with them through a dialogue aimed at support, which the Committee experts themselves could provide, in order to find the most viable means for each country that has not yet done so to comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We would like to thank the Government of Norway for the support and cooperation it is providing to various regional organizations in Africa to ensure full compliance with the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Another aspect of particular importance to Mexico is the dialogue established between the Committee and the various regional and subregional organizations. We believe it is necessary and appropriate to strengthen cooperation between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and regional organizations on the basis of dialogue, exchange of information and respect for their respective spheres of competence in order to broaden the possibilities for support required by States to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">To the extent allowed by their mandates, regional organizations have been developing an array of activities in order to strengthen the fight against international terrorism. The activities carried out by the Organization of American States (OAS) have been particularly fruitful.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">One of the major achievements in our hemisphere has been the conclusion, under the presidency of Mexico, of the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism. This instrument, which complements the international legal framework in combating this scourge, was adopted and opened for signature in Barbados at the thirty-second General Assembly of the OAS on 3 June. I am pleased to report that 30 of the 34 member States of the organization, Mexico included, have signed this new instrument. Not only does the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism strengthen hemisphere-wide cooperation; it also supports international efforts in this sphere.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">In this new phase of its work, the Committee must continue to comply with its mandate to promote international cooperation to combat international terrorism. Furthermore, we feel that the Committee should assist in identifying additional measures that should be adopted by the international community to combat terrorism, without losing sight of the fact that any measure adopted to combat terrorism should, in addition to criminal focus, have a preventive dimension. The new instruments to be adopted should put greater emphasis on prevention and also be aimed at strengthening the capacity of States to implement the necessary measures.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Levitte</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">France associates itself with the statement that will later be made by the Ambassador of Spain on behalf of the 15 member States of the European Union. But I would like to say a few words in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Last 11 September, we experienced one of the moments that define the development of the world for many years and perhaps decades to come. The question that arose was whether the Security Council would meet the challenge posed to the entire international community. Our meeting today shows once again, I believe, that, yes, the Security Council has been able to cope with its new responsibilities, and it has been able to do so in an exemplary manner.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">This is first and foremost the result of the work of one person, Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, to whom I would like to pay a special and well-deserved tribute. I would also like to include in that tribute a woman, Anna Clunes, who is part of the delegation of the United Kingdom and who has carried out tremendous work. Beyond that, it is in fact the entire Council, first of all through the Vice-Chairmen, that should show the result achieved in a few months time. This result is first a method, I believe, a determination to have total transparency with regard not just to the Member States but also, above and beyond that, all those who have come as partners, especially regional organizations, and therefore an ability to act as a team, not just within the Council and the permanent missions in New York but also with the networks of international organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Sir Jeremy has reminded us of the results. One hundred sixty reports have been received and considered. This shows not just the success but also the importance that all States members of the community of nations attach to the work done by the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Regional and technical organizations are henceforth not just informed but also mobilized, along with the CTC, which seems to be a veritable umbrella that covers all these organizations and thereby ensures a necessary consistency in the work of the entire community of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We shall soon be going on to the second, more targeted phase of the work, which, on the basis of a dialogue with each country, will enable us first of all to identify the areas in which each country should improve its legislation and the administrations involved. Secondly -- and above all, I would say -- this phase will enable us to identify the work of technical cooperation that not the Security Council but the organizations identified by the Council and Member States will make available to States that need such technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">This second phase is crucial. It will be more targeted and concrete. Indeed, it will enable the world, following an unprecedented auditing of the state of the world in combating terrorism, to work to improve the situation, State by State, and the steps to be taken by all.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">France has already indicated the areas in which it was prepared to provide such technical assistance. Beyond that, the French-speaking world, which will hold a summit meeting in October in Beirut, is mobilizing the means at its disposal for States that are part of a culture that goes beyond a single language and a common legal culture.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Once again, I would like to pay tribute to Sir Jeremy and his entire team. Let us continue to work in the good spirit that he himself has inspired in us.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tidjani</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">The representative of Singapore has warned us: Sir Jeremy Greenstock will bend today under the weight of the congratulations extended to him. Allow me at the outset to express our admiration to Sir Jeremy for the tactful and effective way in which he has conducted the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) created by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> over the past nine months. His very detailed, updated and enriching information on the Committee's activity over the past 90 days show, without a doubt, the commitment and determination of the Committee to strengthen the capacity of States to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">In fact, the global nature of terrorism and its clear ties with trans-border crime necessarily require a concerted response on the part of the international community. We believe this is essential. In order to effectively combat this phenomenon, all States without exception must adopt specific measures and must cooperate frankly and constructively to meet this challenge, which is the very denial of the right to life. Today, beyond condemning terrorism, action is needed -- individual and collective action by States against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Beyond the indignation and reprobation expressed at the highest Government level in the wake of the sad events of 11 September 2001, Cameroon, whose legal framework already had a counter-terrorism strategy and provisions to prevent and punish terrorist acts, immediately, at all levels of Government, set about drafting specific legislation integrating the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. On this point, I welcome the cooperation we received within the Committee, as well as the prospects of assistance, the form of which has become ever clearer. Here, we welcome Norway's commitment to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">We urge all States, as well as international, regional and subregional organizations whose activities could be related to counter-terrorism to cooperate fully with the <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> Committee to enable the Committee better to carry out its immense task, the scope and importance of which are growing every day. In fact, in its nine months of existence, the Committee has already considered 127 of the 160 national reports that States have submitted to it, an average of 14 reports per month. That is considerable work, and an unprecedented event in the history of our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">In our view, particular attention should be given to the content of the letters addressed to States following consideration of their national reports because of the importance of the supplementary questions in those letters, which should enable the States concerned more precisely and effectively to target areas where additional legislative, regulatory or administrative efforts need to be made to prevent and suppress terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">It is from this vantage point that we would call upon the 29 States that have not yet submitted their reports in accordance with paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, to take measures to rapidly overcome the difficulties they are facing and cooperate with the Committee. Only then will we be able perhaps to celebrate the first anniversary of the Counter-Terrorism Committee with the adoption of a common platform of recommendations on the prevention and suppression of this scourge that continues to haunt us.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">We are convinced that the dialogue envisaged by the Committee with the 29 States is correct, because it will preserve the transparency and cooperation that have always guided its work. This should be acknowledged and encouraged, and we invite Member States to respond favourably to the appeal made to them.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">We also appreciate the dialogue that has been set up between the Committee and regional and subregional organizations, as well as international organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Maritime Organization, the International Criminal Police Organization and many others. This initiative too must be pursued, because it will enable us further to define and reduce the scope of activities related to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">Cameroon fully endorses the Committee's new work programme for the fourth quarter, from 26 June to 23 September 2002, as well as the present structure of the Committee and its working methods, as outlined by Sir Jeremy Greenstock. The Committee should take advantage of the next three-month period to begin an active phase of progressive assessment, involving the formulation of specific recommendations based on the information provided by each State. It is clear that, at this stage of its work, the Committee may still need additional information from some States. This defining stage requires more transparency and specificity on the part of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">We feel that the regular briefings provided by the Chairman of the Committee are an ideal way to reassure the Member States about working methods, but I am already convinced that there will be broad and useful participation of Member States in the next three months, reflecting the considerable impact made by the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa11">Moreover, we are pleased to note that the question of assistance continues to be of primary concern to the Committee. Undeniably, States are eagerly awaiting a complete and more understandable format for the provision of assistance. We feel that the Committee could speed up the gradual implementation of the directory of assistance in order to provide many States with sufficient information on the nature of the assistance proposed by bilateral and multilateral donors, and in particular on how to gain access to that assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa12">We feel it is important for each subcommittee, when meeting with delegations to consider their national reports, to systematically provide detailed and updated information about assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa13">Finally, my delegation would like to congratulate the Secretariat, the experts and the subcommittees, as well as the colleagues of Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for the quality of their assistance to the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa14">All these efforts would be in vain if together we did not clearly express our unshakable determination to cooperate in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Only international, regional and subregional cooperation will enable us effectively to combat this scourge. Regional and subregional organizations must become the true agents in the fight against terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism Committee must be able to count on them anytime, anywhere.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Yingfan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The Chinese delegation wishes to thank Ambassador Greenstock for his briefing on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). Since its establishment, the CTC has accomplished a great deal of effective work. Its fair, open and transparent working methods have won acclaim by the vast majority of Member States. Coordination and cooperation among the subcommittees are proceeding smoothly. We believe that the Committee's review of the first phase of its work has been fruitful. My delegation agrees with Ambassador Greenstock's summary and assessment of the Committee's work to date. We also appreciate the efforts and the great amount of work done by the experts and the Secretariat. Like other members, China endorses the Committee's work programme for the fourth 90-day period and the procedure for the second-phase review.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">Ambassador Greenstock pointed out in his report that the Committee has a strong interest in capacity-building. My delegation has also noted that, in the second-phase review, the Committee will focus on the question of providing the assistance needed by Member States to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We appeal to potential providers of assistance to respond actively to the Committee's call and to provide timely and effective assistance to countries in need.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">We endorse the Committee's pragmatic working methods, intended to step up the pace of work in the interest of soon completing the review of national reports.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">The fight against terrorism is a new task for the Security Council as it discharges its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. In order to enable the United Nations to play its core role in the international fight against terrorism, the Security Council must focus on the real problems involved and take measures to facilitate their resolution, stepping up international counter-terrorism cooperation so as to make such efforts more effective.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">The work of the CTC to date has laid a good foundation for the counter-terrorism efforts of Member States and for international cooperation to that end. We should note, however, that capacity-building for combating terrorism is a long-term process -- one that is inseparable from the international fight against terrorism. The Security Council should focus on how the counter-terrorism efforts of the United Nations can be integrated into the international fight against terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Corr</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I would like, first of all, to thank you, Mr. President, for arranging today's open meeting of the Council on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). Ireland fully associates itself with the statement to be delivered later in the debate by Spain on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> set in motion the construction of global scaffolding against international terrorism. Clear and defined tasks are required of all States through <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> -- tasks relating to legislative and executive actions against international terrorism. The provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> involve the establishment and maintenance of a global consensus of action. Those who perpetrate acts of international terrorism are the enemies of all States, and they must be the friends of none.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">It is now realistic to assess what has been achieved. At one important level, there has been a dramatic and welcome increase in the number of States that have ratified some or all of the 12 international conventions and protocols against terrorism. At another level, throughout the world legislative measures are being put in place in response to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and executive decisions are being taken. In summary, a strong architectural framework in the fight by the international community against international terrorism is now clearly visible.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">I want to pay special tribute to the Chairman of the CTC, Ambassador Greenstock, and his colleagues in New York and London, for the leadership and support given to the Committee since its establishment. We appreciate this work, which has been well done. My delegation also appreciates the work of the three Vice-Chairmen -- Ambassador Koonjul, Ambassador Lavrov and Ambassador Valdivieso -- and thanks the experts and the Secretariat for their commitment and dedication in the complex and difficult work of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">At this stage in our debate, I would like to make a few general points of importance to my delegation. First, the CTC must continue to avoid at all costs -- as it has done to date -- any simplistic formula, such as "You have succeeded; you have not succeeded", in its approach to States. Many of the detailed requirements -- on banking or finance, for example -- are extremely complex. Many States -- often because their economies are not fully or even partially integrated into the global economy -- never had any need until now to put in place technical legislation in respect of financial flows or regulatory frameworks. All of this will take time and effort. What is noteworthy today is how much has already been achieved. That said, it is important that all States reply to the CTC as required under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Secondly, the CTC must continue to be vigilant in the extreme in not going beyond the letter or the spirit of what is required by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The CTC, and the wider United Nations, must complement the work of other institutions, which have their own specific mandates or roles in the struggle against terrorism. They must not duplicate this work or replace it. The role of the United Nations is to provide global legitimacy, to build a global consensus, to act as the defender and promoter of multilateralism and internationalism against those who are enemies of the international good.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">In so doing, we must continue to be guided by the need to avoid any actions that could undermine this sense of international legitimacy in the struggle against international terrorism, just as we must also progress in our work of protecting that sense of international legitimacy. As we advance in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, it may well be necessary at some stage for the Security Council to strengthen and protect this sense of legitimacy by a renewed mandate in the light of our experiences to date.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">Thirdly, Ireland attaches great importance to generous assistance by the international community in supporting the efforts of developing countries to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. That is what we agreed to do in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1377(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1377 (2001)</a>. Ireland welcomes the work of the CTC to date in this area. We hope the concept of a trust fund will also be kept under review. We understand the problems but hope that they can be solved.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">Ireland, for its part, is in the process of compiling a list of experts who could be included in the CTC's directory of advice and expertise in the areas of legislative and administrative practices, as set out in the relevant provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We are also ready to support capacity-building in relation to the specified areas through existing bilateral aid programmes at country level and the provision of fellowships for participation in relevant courses or seminars in Ireland.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">Ireland will continue to work with our developing country partners to come up with a list of areas in which relevant assistance can be provided, either within the framework of existing programmes or by means of additional mechanisms.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa11">Fourthly, and most important, the fight against international terrorism can never be at the expense of human rights. This is not a point of narrow emphasis: if we in the international community go down that road -- and it is a slippery road -- then we are lost, as are the core values that the United Nations stands for. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, in a speech to the Commonwealth Institute in London on 6 June, spoke of</p>
	<blockquote id="pg011-bk01-pa12">"a subtle change in emphasis in many parts of the world; order and security have become the overriding priorities. In the past, the world has learned that emphasis on national order and security often involved curtailment of democracy and human rights. As a result, a shadow has been cast".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa13">We need to heed those words of wisdom and warning.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa14">Finally, Ireland fully shares the view that regional organizations have a critical role to play in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and we warmly welcome progress in that area to date.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I would like first of all to associate myself with the words of appreciation that have been expressed to the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Greenstock, and to thank him both for the comprehensive account of what has been done by the Committee that he has headed for the past nine months, and for the efforts that he personally has been making in order to guarantee such results.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Thanks to the energetic work being carried out openly by the CTC under the auspices of the United Nations, an unprecedented global system to combat terrorism is being created. We very much appreciate the fact that in carrying out its work, the Committee has knitted together all areas of its activity into one organic whole. First of all, it has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the reports submitted to it on the counter-terrorism measures of various countries, and secondly, it is seeking concrete ways and means to provide advice and technical assistance to those States that need such assistance in order to comply with their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">We welcome the Committee's intention to focus in particular on cooperation with regional and subregional organizations in the fight against terrorism. We believe that cooperation between the CTC and the Commonwealth of Independent States anti-terrorism centre and the regional anti-terrorist structure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization would prove very fruitful.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">We support the programme of work of the CTC for the fourth 90-day period. The Committee, in essence, is entering into a new phase of its work, in which its major task will be to study the additional reports submitted by States in response to requests by the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">Of course, it is important at this stage to define and clarify the ways and means and methods that will guide the Committee in making recommendations, in order to eliminate any gaps or flaws. We are convinced that the success of this work is guaranteed, given the dedication of the Council and the Committee as well as the overall clear understanding that the CTC will not function as a punitive body or overstep the bounds of its mandate. This is especially important with respect to the involvement in the work of the CTC of those States that, for one reason or another, have not yet submitted reports to it pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">In his letter of 13 June addressed to you, Mr. President, the Chairman of the CTC concretely and clearly described the situation and the prospects for the work of the Committee on this question. The work of the Committee promotes the establishment of a solid basis for the comprehensive implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We believe that we in the CTC are providing a clear confirmation of the effective discharge by the Security Council of its major functions as the body that is responsible, under the Charter of the United Nations, for the maintenance of international peace and security. Russia in future will take an active part in the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, I should like to thank the delegations that have warmly commended the work of the Bureau of the CTC.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdivieso</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Let me also begin by expressing my gratitude for the considerable efforts and great dedication of Ambassador Greenstock as Chairman of the Committee. We would like also to thank him for his briefing. I wish also to say that we endorse the statement that will be made by Ambassador Niehaus of Costa Rica on behalf of the Rio Group.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">Colombia recognizes the progress that has been achieved during this first phase of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and supports the programme of work established for the second phase. My country reiterates the CTC's appeal to all States Members of the Organization to review together and to implement effective and appropriate mechanisms in order to stop those who today are instilling fear in humankind through terrorist acts and threats from achieving their goals.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">In this respect, I wish to highlight, as Mexico has done, the very recent adoption in the American continent of the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism, which is an effective instrument in the combat against this scourge. This is a welcome sign of the importance and the effectiveness of efforts carried out in a spirit of solidarity by a regional group acting jointly.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">It is essential for the CTC to continue to strengthen its relations of cooperation and assistance with international, regional and subregional organizations, as they represent a fundamental instrument in combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">In the area of technical and financial assistance, I should like to highlight the importance of the establishment by the CTC of an on-line directory for Member States on the resources and expertise available in the areas covered by the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">This directory has been designed to help, during the second phase -- in which the Committee will analyse the reports -- those Governments that request information and technical assistance as well as other forms of assistance offered by other States and by Committee experts, in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">In the second phase of processing and analyzing State reports, the Committee must focus its activities and programme of work on priority areas such as the identification by its experts and subcommittee members of the shortcomings of some States in the area of counter-terrorism instruments. Thus recommendations should be proposed as to the measures that should be adopted within a particular State, in particular in the legislative and administrative areas, as well as in the field of law enforcement, in order to suppress the financing of terrorism. We deem very useful the suggestion made by the representative of Singapore regarding the criteria for assessing and evaluating such gaps or shortcomings.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">My delegation recognizes the importance and the effectiveness of the measures and actions that have been adopted by the majority of Member States in compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, as well as the activities that have been carried out by some regional organizations to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">However, given present-day events, in particular the serious threats that have been publicly made by terrorist individuals and organizations, such as those relating to actions planned by Al-Qaeda, for example, as well as the numerous terrorist acts being carried out throughout the world, we should reflect on what else can be done in the CTC to prevent terrorism from continuing to sow fear, dread and uncertainty throughout the world, causing countless deaths and the destruction of State infrastructures. For that reason, we must continue to seek out innovative and effective solutions to strengthen national capacities in order to strengthen international cooperation in the area of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">The answers to these questions should therefore constitute the premises that the Committee should consider during the second phase of its work. It should determine whether or not the measures it is taking are sufficient and if it needs to rethink its actions or reformulate the modalities of its work.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">A number of agencies in various countries have warned of the possibility of new and worse operations and attacks by terrorist groups. We must promote actions and create mechanisms in order to address these threats in order to prevent them, or, at least, reduce their severity, and, above all, to avert the serious consequences of such attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa12">For that reason, one objective in the international community's efforts to combat terrorism must be to continue to learn sufficiently about the capacities of, and the methods used by, terrorist organizations, so that we can move from our primarily reactive response -- pursuing and capturing terrorists after they have achieved their objectives -- to a preventive approach, using key indicators to predict terrorist attacks before they happen.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa13">We know that this is not an easy task. The CTC must continue to move forward and cooperate with regional organizations, Member States and other international or private organizations in the quest for adequate and effective solutions.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa14">The next public debate in this Chamber will give us an opportunity to analyse in greater depth the major challenges posed by terrorism, which require greater efforts on the part of the United Nations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Koonjul</span> <span class="nation">Mauritius</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">Let me join other colleagues in heartily congratulating the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for the very good work accomplished by the CTC under his able leadership. His dedication to the work of the Committee, his drive to push forward and to realize to the fullest extent possible the agenda set forth by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, as well as his personal commitment and effort in bringing home to Member States as well as to various regional and subregional organizations the cardinal responsibility of eradicating terrorism -- root and branch -- have been exemplary. It can be said that the outreach programme that he has undertaken has been one of the most successful United Nations in-house programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">The overwhelming response from Member States and their cooperation with the CTC at all levels reflect the serious commitment of each Member State to address the problem of terrorism. Indeed, we have been able to develop a broad, comprehensive and, above all, sustained strategy to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">As a member of the Bureau, I wish to convey my gratitude to all the other members of the CTC, the experts, the staff of the Secretariat and the dedicated staff of the Mission of the United Kingdom responsible for CTC matters. I also wish to thank the representatives of all those countries that responded to the invitation of subcommittee B to discuss the draft letters in the most transparent and even-handed manner. The spirit in which our discussions have taken place has been most cordial and cooperative, and it is our hope that that spirit will continue to guide relations between the CTC and Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The dangers of terrorism and of possible attacks by terrorists are realities that cannot be escaped. Terrorism has no geographical boundaries. It attacks indiscriminately and ruthlessly. A terrorist attack, be it in Kashmir or in the Middle East, does not only have negative effects in the locality in which it takes taken place, it has ripple effects that may result in a conflagration of unprecedented violence throughout the globe. That is why we cannot stand idly by or be passive onlookers.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">The standards set under various international conventions and instruments give us hope that terrorism can be stopped. The far-reaching mandate of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, if fully implemented and respected by each State Member of the international community, will, to a large extent, guarantee international peace and security and rid the world of the scourge of terrorism. In order to ensure that we attain that goal, it is important to address the following issues in a comprehensive manner.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">We will need to look into ways to prevent the proliferation of future terrorists and terrorist organizations. We will also need to address the root causes of terrorism, as well as to explore ways to enforce rigorous rules and laws, at the domestic, regional and international level, on issues such as drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorist financing and traffic in small arms and light weapons. Lastly, perhaps the most important issue -- which is a matter that the CTC is clearly focusing on fully -- is to give the necessary assistance in fully implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> to those countries that need it.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">My delegation supports the appeal made by the Chairman to those States that have not yet submitted a report to open a line of communication with the CTC and to keep the Committee informed of any difficulty they are facing in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Their response is all the more important if we are to keep up the momentum in the international alliance against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">Finally, I would like to reiterate my personal commitment to the work of the CTC, as well as the commitment of my Government to fully implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tafrov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I shall try to be brief, as I am the next to last member of the Council to take the floor, because I agree fully with the analysis made by previous speakers and also because Bulgaria fully endorses the statement to be made shortly by the representative of Spain on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The fact that I am the penultimate speaker among members places me in a somewhat difficult position, because the praise given to the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), and to its Chairman in particular, has been extremely eloquent and it is very difficult to add much more. However, I would like to underscore the fact that, in our opinion, the success achieved by the Committee and by its Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, is not due solely to its working methods, evoked by Jean-David Levitte a few moments ago, but also to a certain style, a style that is on a par with the task at hand and that is characterized by extraordinary intellectual and moral rigour, equality, benevolent discipline and full transparency leading to consensus. I must say that we have rarely seen an individual contribute so much to such a noble cause. Sir Jeremy Greenstock and his colleagues in the United Kingdom Mission are showing that diplomacy serves some purpose.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">I must very briefly highlight the aspects of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee that are of the greatest interest to us. First and foremost, I wish to mention the unprecedented audit of the legislative, administrative and other capacities of States Members of the United Nations. That audit is indeed unprecedented, and it has also been very effective and thorough. Political will is generally present, but further efforts must nevertheless be made. There are still countries that have not yet submitted reports. They must do so.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">In particular, I wish to emphasize the importance that Bulgaria attaches to the ratification of the 12 United Nations counter-terrorism instruments. I will not hide the fact that my country is proud to be among the 14 States to have ratified all 12 conventions.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">It is a strong temptation for me not to conclude on such a specific point, but, as Sir Jeremy mentioned a while ago, a regional political forum of the countries of South-Eastern Europe is being held today in Sofia on the subject of the fight against terrorism. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are all taking part in that meeting. Principal among the major objectives of the forum is to establish permanent regional counter-terrorism structures. Another important objective is to develop a coordinated plan of action among the States of the region and to encourage the creation through parliaments of national structures devoted to combating terrorism and to help accelerate the adoption of counter-terrorism legislation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">I wish to point out, among the more specific objectives, a unified format for travel documents and identity cards for citizens of the States of the region. And also on the agenda are items for training police officers and customs inspectors to combat human trafficking, illegal immigration, and drug trafficking, which very often are the very source of terrorism. My delegation will inform Members of the United Nations of the results of its activities because we firmly believe in the need for a regional approach to the fight against terrorism. From this standpoint the work of the CTC is headed in the right direction.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I will make a statement in my capacity as representative of the Syrian Arab Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">The Syrian delegation expresses it gratitude to the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Sir Jeremy Greenstock, to the Vice-Chairmen, the Committee's members, the experts, the Committee secretariat and the Translation Services for their successful efforts during the previous phases of the Committee's work. We also wish to thank the Secretary-General for facilitating the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">The Committee, in previous phases of its work has been able to meet the requirements of its commitments and mandate primarily through the response of most Member States to the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Specifically, 159 requisite reports have been submitted to the Committee to date, with four more reports to come. We note that a few States have been unable to submit their reports. This in no way is due to unwillingness to abide by the requirements of the resolution but rather is due to difficulties previously raised by the Committee Chairman at previous meetings. Syria welcomes the provision by the CTC of all forms of assistance -- technical, financial and administrative -- to these countries in the preparation of the requisite reports.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">The Chairman of the CTC presented to the Council a clear and precise work plan for the CTC's next phase. While Syria is determined to make every possible effort to ensure the realization of that work plan through its cooperation in meeting the expectations of Member States, we stress that guaranteed success depends primarily on the response from Member States. Success depends also on concerted international efforts to combat all forms and manifestations of terrorism, as well as an analysis of its roots and causes.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">Combating terrorism requires all of us to make genuine and sincere efforts in different fields. It requires of the Security Council members in particular further coordination and concentration of efforts, particularly at the regional level. The Syrian Arab Republic, whose genuine contributions to combating terrorism are known to many States, will continue to do its utmost to achieve our common objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">I now resume my function as President of the Security Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">It is an honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as Iceland, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">The European Union welcomes this new opportunity to review the work of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee. We commend and support the transparency with which it works, and we thank Ambassador Greenstock for his commitment and involvement in this essential task.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">The fight against terrorism remains an absolute priority for the European Union. In this context we acknowledge the central role of the United Nations through the Security Council and the CTC, and we affirm our full commitment. The Committee is now entering the second phase in its consideration of the reports. A great effort has been made by members of the Committee, its experts and the Secretariat to analyse the wealth of information provided by more than one hundred and fifty reports. Member States should provide the CTC with their pending reports, whether initial or subsequent. We urge those countries that have not yet presented their national reports to do so.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">However, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is not complied with through mere presentation of reports. The essential point is to implement the resolution fully, and reports should reflect the reality of legal and practical measures adopted at the national or regional level. The European Union will provide a timely response to the Committee's request for clarifications. Similarly, its member States will do likewise in their national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">International solidarity and cooperation constitute essential instruments to fight the scourge of terrorism. The European Union stands ready to assist third countries to reinforce their capacity to respond effectively to this international threat. The European Commission has further scope to offer assistance in the areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> through existing programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">The European Union expects that the CTC and countries or regions in serious need of assistance will provide specific requests. This would enable the Commission and the European Union member States, together with the international financial institutions and other donors, to enhance coordination to identify and implement concrete actions. An overview of the European Union assistance programmes appears on the CTC's website. The European Union will remain in close consultation with the CTC, since it is an important forum for coordinating requests with offers of assistance in counter-terrorism actions.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">The Chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe organized an important conference in Lisbon in June, at which representatives of various international organizations discussed the need for coordination among regional organizations. The European Union stated there that we must try to avoid overlapping and proliferation of bodies with similar or identical tasks. Time and resources should be used more effectively through identifying the added value each organization can provide. To that end, the CTC is optimally qualified to serve as a clearing house for contacts and information exchange on the activities of the various international bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">The effectiveness of national counter-terrorism efforts can be greatly enhanced through regional organizations. The Union is well prepared for that, as it is not just a cooperation organization; it is geared towards developing common norms and policies. During these past three months, the Union has continued to implement the Common Position and the Action Plan adopted after the events of 11 September. We have revised and substantively enlarged the list of terrorist individuals, entities and groups, which is annexed to the European Common Position of 27 December 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">We recently adopted European Council <i>(regulation 881/2002)</i>, which incorporates the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1390(2002).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1390 (2002)</a>. The most recent development occurred on 13 June 2002, when the competent European ministers approved harmonization of the criminal offence of terrorism through an agreement that entails a common definition of terrorism that carries the most severe penalties of each national legal system.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">The establishment of joint investigation teams and the framework decision on the common European arrest warrant and surrender procedures were also approved. This will result in a procedure that is much simpler than the traditional extradition procedures, which judges will use to detain terrorist suspects and to turn them over to the requesting State member of the Union.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa11">The European Union is convinced that the fight against terrorism must respect human rights and the rule of law, and that individual human rights must be taken into account in the design and implementation of sanctions in the fight against terrorism. The Union believes that States, in fighting terrorism, must not condone acts of indiscriminate violence against civilians or use counter-terrorism as a pretext for political repression. We commend the Committee's contacts with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and its acceptance of parallel monitoring of the observance of human rights obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa12">The European Union is trying to assist in the fight of the international community, urging the speedy signature or ratification of the 12 United Nations instruments against terrorism. We remain committed to finalizing negotiation of the draft comprehensive convention against terrorism. The United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention at Vienna should provide Member States upon request technical assistance for the signature, accession, ratification and effective implementation of those international instruments. The Union awaits the report of the Secretary-General, requested by the General Assembly in its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-253.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 56/253</a>, which will make proposals to strengthen the United Nations Terrorism Prevention Branch to enable it to carry out its mandate, as approved by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, the international fight against terrorism is going to require a long and costly effort on the part of us all. It can succeed only through strong and sustained international cooperation. The United Nations, particularly the Counter-Terrorism Committee, will be crucial to its success. We urge all States and international organizations to offer full assistance.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Costa Rica. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Niehaus</span> <span class="nation">Costa Rica</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">I am pleased to address the Security Council, on behalf of the 19 States members of the Rio Group, during its consideration of the third quarterly report of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. I wish to begin by thanking Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Committee, for his briefing and for his excellent work at the head of that body. I wish also to congratulate the Vice-Chairmen of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">The States members of the Rio Group condemn and reject terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. At the same time, we firmly support all cooperation and coordination measures adopted internationally and regionally and within a framework of strict observance of human rights, the rule of law, international humanitarian law and other norms and principles of international law, with a view to combating terrorism. In that context, as the representatives of  Mexico and Colombia have stated, the 3 June 2002 adoption of the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism by the Organization of American States significantly bolsters regional mechanisms to combat this scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">The Rio Group is particularly pleased to note the submission of more than 160 national reports, in compliance with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We appreciate the vast work of the Committee, which has enabled it, with professionalism and transparency, to consider the vast majority of those reports. We hope that the Committee will soon be able to consider the reports it has not yet been able to examine. However, we note that a small number of States have still not submitted their first reports, in accordance with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and we call on them to submit them as soon as possible. In that regard, we believe that the Committee experts on the provision of assistance could help them resolve any practical difficulties they may face.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">The Rio Group welcomes the opportunity for constructive dialogue between the Security Council and United Nations Member States provided through the submission and consideration of national reports. We believe that the Committee's success depends on its capacity to generate and maintain ongoing communication among the Organization, its Member States and regional organizations, with a view to strengthening intergovernmental and inter-institutional assistance and cooperation to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">In that context, we believe that the Committee must facilitate the provision of technical assistance and financial cooperation to those States requiring it to strengthen their justice systems and their legislative frameworks. Therefore, we welcome the Committee's intention to serve as a contact point between countries and bodies providing assistance and the States requesting assistance. The States members of the Rio Group hope that, in the coming months, in accordance with its programme of work, the Committee will consider the second round of reports and the clarifications requested of States. Similarly, we trust that in the coming months the Committee will pursue dialogue with all countries in order to ensure the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and to strengthen the capacity of States to combat terrorism. That is the Committee's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">We endorse the understanding within the Committee that it need not assume quasi-judicial functions or declare that some States have complied with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> while others have not. We agree with Ambassador Greenstock's assessment that continuous efforts are required to achieve the objectives enshrined in the resolution and that therefore no State can consider its work complete. We trust that during the next phase the Committee will continue to work transparently and to be impartial in its results.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">In the next three months the Committee should also increase contacts with regional organizations in order to coordinate its counter-terrorism efforts. We note that those organizations can act only within their respective mandates and in accordance with their statutes. In this framework, cooperation between those organizations and the Committee must be in strict compliance with those mandates. At the same time, we believe it is necessary for States members of those bodies to consider the role that each of them can play within their respective spheres of competence.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">During the upcoming period the Committee will also have to meet the challenge of its growing practical and financial requirements. The work of that body is consuming significant quantities of the limited resources of the Organization. To date, its needs have been met with resources earmarked for other programmes and mandates. This is not a sustainable solution, given that other programmes are equally necessary for the international community. We therefore consider it essential to allocate resources to the Committee within the Organization's budget.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">We the members of the Rio Group are aware that combating terrorism should lead us to build more open and tolerant societies. As clearly stated by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, combating terrorism requires that the root of the problems that cause insecurity be attacked. In this context, we know that the best protection against terrorism is respect for human rights and democracy in all spheres. Therefore, combating this scourge should lead to the establishment of a true culture of peace, tolerance and solidarity. These are the values that the Counter-Terrorism Committee must promote.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">At this juncture, ASEAN wishes to thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), His Excellency Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the Vice-Chairmen, the other Committee members and all the experts involved for their dedication and hard work.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">We very much welcome these open meetings to hear updates by the Chairman of the CTC on its work. We appreciate the progress made by the Committee and note that it has already issued 127 responses to the reports submitted by Member States in response to paragraph 6 of Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and is ready to review the second round of reports. In that regard, we wish to emphasize that all ASEAN member countries have already submitted their first reports and, at this stage, are progressing towards fulfilling the next requirements of the CTC. We look forward to further efforts by the Committee and others to provide assistance to ASEAN member countries in need of help in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">Allow me to give a further update on ASEAN's ongoing efforts to combat international terrorism. An important ASEAN achievement was the special ministerial meeting on terrorism held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 20 and 21 May 2002. While noting with concern the close links between transnational crime and terrorism, which lend greater urgency to efforts to combat transnational crime, our ministers agreed to endorse a comprehensive work programme on terrorism to implement the ASEAN Plan of Action to Combat Transnational Crime, which included, among other things: exchange of information; the compilation and dissemination of relevant laws and regulations of ASEAN member countries; the compilation and dissemination of bilateral and multilateral agreements and information on relevant international treaties where feasible; the development of multilateral or bilateral legal arrangements to facilitate apprehension, investigation, prosecution, extradition, inquiry and seizure in order to enhance mutual legal and administrative assistance among ASEAN member countries where feasible; the enhancement of cooperation and coordination in law enforcement and intelligence sharing; and the development of regional training programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">Offers were also made at the meeting by Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia with respect to training and capacity-building for all ASEAN member countries. The ministers also agreed to designate principal contact points in all ASEAN member countries on counter-terrorism matters. The progress made in the implementation of these programmes will be reviewed at subsequent meetings of ASEAN ministers responsible for transnational crime issues.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">An ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) workshop on the prevention of terrorism was held in Bangkok on 17 to 19 April, organized by the Governments of Thailand and Australia. It was opened by the Foreign Minister of Thailand. The workshop concluded that greater exchange of information and intelligence and further cooperation among law enforcement and other relevant security agencies were essential tools in the fight against terrorism. Participants agreed that training and exercises among ARF countries could contribute usefully towards the development of national and regional capabilities to prevent terrorism. They further agreed that ARF participating countries be invited to submit to the ARF Chair summaries of measures taken nationally in response to the terrorist threat.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">Earlier, another ARF workshop on financial measures against terrorism was jointly organized in Honolulu by the United States and Malaysia from 24 to 26 March 2002. Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore will also jointly organize the third ARF workshop on counter-terrorism in Tokyo in September or October 2002, which will focus on security arrangements for large-scale events. These workshops are examples of ASEAN-led efforts to promote cooperation between countries within South-East Asia and those outside the region to combat international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">In addition, various projects and initiatives related to combating international terrorism were planned by individual ASEAN members such as the agreement on information exchange and establishment of communication procedures signed by Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines in Kuala Lumpur on 7 May 2002, under which the parties to the agreement will cooperate to combat transnational crime, including terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">These steps reflect our commitment to tackle this enormously challenging task. Countering terrorism remains very high on our agenda, and I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the Council of ASEAN's continued cooperation in preventing, countering and suppressing all terrorist acts in accordance with the Charter, all relevant United Nations resolutions, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and the principles of international law.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to Sir Jeremy Greenstock to respond to questions and comments made.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">I very warmly appreciate the words of support and commendation that the Committee has received. I am particularly pleased that Council members and others have warmly recognized the work of the Vice-Chairmen, because the work of the subcommittees has been absolutely crucial to the progress that we have made on the reports. I really pay tribute to the amount of personal effort and intelligent determination that they have brought to the work of the subcommittees.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">I am also glad that members of the Council have recognized the excellent work of our experts, who have formed a truly united team now, which has given us tremendous help -- and of the Secretariat. Council members have also drawn attention to the contribution of my own delegation, which comes better from you, members of the Council, than from me. I want to underline the debt of gratitude that I owe to Anna Clunes and the rest of my team for maintaining an up-front, initiative approach that has provided a real grip on this subject for the whole Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">Let me go through a number of points that arose in the interventions. Ambassador Mahbubani raised three questions with his typical imagination. I think that the criteria for self-assessment are going to emerge from the work that our experts are doing, from their experience of what they are finding in the reports. And the Chair intends to offer to the Committee, with the help of the experts, a synthesis of ongoing experience, which will begin to amount to benchmarks for what we are looking at and what we are looking for. We discussed this with the experts, and in due course over this next period, we will provide some advice to members of the Committee that will be available to the wider membership about what is coming of the reports and what the emerging criteria are on which we are working. I think it is better that this should come out from experience and from an empirical approach rather than from our trying to lay it down as a matter of principles. We will discuss this within the Committee, but I assure Singapore and others that the Committee will work to produce what Ambassador Mahbubani is working for.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">As to preparing for the major annual review that we will have in October, the United Kingdom delegation will commit itself to putting around a paper before that debate that will set out some issues worth deeper discussion. They will be issues that will not be unfamiliar to Committee members, because we discuss most things, but we will try to set the framework for that debate in late September or early October in coordination with the presidency of the month. We will try to make some suggestions to our colleagues on the Council as to what we should be looking at.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">Ambassador Mahbubani asked a third question. He really set a little trap that is tempting to fall into. So I shall. He asked for a layman's analogy, and what occurred to me in response was that the Committee has in a sense become a fitness trainer. A fitness trainer is, in many respects, your friend, because he is aiming to do you good; and in some respects he is your enemy because he is hurting you. It hurts, but it prolongs your life. The important thing about the Counter-Terrorism Committee is that it is acting on doctor's orders. There is the threat of a life-affecting disease that we are having to attack. We have to raise our capability to deal with this. Nearly all of us need help in doing so.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">The CTC is the catalyst for the provision of the instruments for raising that capacity. The fitter the global system is, without exception, to meet the threat of the disease of terrorism, the longer our global society will remain healthy and will prolong its life. I think this is a fair analogy, but do not forget that it is under doctor's orders. It is your choice, Member States, whether you respond to the programme, but your doctor has laid out the prescription.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">Many of you have referred to non-reporting States, and we are working in cooperation with those States to make sure that they report soon. I would like to underline, please, the role of the regional groups in making sure that their members do respond to the requirement of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We were not going to have a comprehensive debate today, and not all regional groups have decided to contribute, but I note that those regional groups from whom the great majority of non-reporters come have not decided to contribute today. There is a responsibility within the region to make sure that members who have not reported do not let down those members who have reported.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">A number of speakers -- including Mexico, Ireland, the European Union (EU) and the Rio Group -- have commented on the relationship between our work and the requirements of human rights, and on the balance that is needed in this area. I think the Committee has got this balance right in showing a considerable awareness of human rights requirements, but not taking on any responsibility as a function -- because it is not our function -- and in having a good relationship with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, with civil society and non-governmental organizations who, at some point, I would like the Committee to agree, should come in some guise or other to have a discussion within the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">Let me just make one small comment on the quotation from High Commissioner Mary Robinson that came out of the Irish intervention. She says that her shadow is cast by -- and I paraphrase -- by excessive security. Yes, a shadow is cast on human rights by excessive security. But a shadow is cast on human rights and freedom by inadequate security. We have to realize that there is a balance between the two. The action of terrorists is an attack on human rights and individual rights, and the fight against terrorism is itself an extension of human rights. So let us get the balance right.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">I think many speakers have rightly focused on the assistance programme. We are taking time to get it going to a point at which it is of real practical help to individual Member States. The appointment of two experts in that area has accelerated the programme, and the Committee is committed to producing a website that is of real use within the 90-day period coming up. I think that the United States is right to draw attention to the fact that donors must offer more, because there are donors out there -- or potential donors -- who have not come forward. We will be enhancing our contacts with them to accelerate the programme. I warmly welcome the words of the European Union in establishing itself as a major source of donor activity, and we will be in contact with the European Union to chase it up.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">I will continue to have open meetings with United Nations Members, and I have to say that I am extremely grateful to the members of delegations who come along to these meetings -- in quite considerable numbers -- for the spirit with which they enter the conversations and for the care they take to realize the opportunity we give them to ask questions and to look at areas where they are uncertain about the Committee's approach. I think this is a very important aspect of the Committee's work, and I appreciate the response.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa12">Finally, I think that the intervention of the Rio Group made a good point about resources. We do not have, in this area, the resources that the importance of the subject dictates. That is something that we will have to look at -- not just the provision of assistance, but the resources that come from the United Nations family and the Secretariat in making sure that the work of the Committee continues to be of real practical value to all United Nations Members and that the momentum behind the Committee is maintained. That is an area that we will have to look at on the agenda of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa13">I thank you, Mr. President, for your care in having organized and presided over this meeting, which I think has been very useful. We look forward to reporting from the Committee on our next 90-day period.</p>
