	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the eighth report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic, <a href="../pdf/S-1999-1038.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/1038</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">I shall first give the floor to those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Burleigh</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The United States will join consensus to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) for a three-month period.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Since its establishment two years ago, MINURCA has helped create a much improved security situation in the Central African Republic. This, in turn, allowed the Government to conduct a peaceful presidential election on 19 September and to begin implementing much needed reforms. In this regard, we commend the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Ambassador Adeniji, and the men and women of MINURCA for their outstanding efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Much work, however, remains to be done in the Central African Republic -- not by MINURCA, but by the Government and people themselves. MINURCA's job is essentially completed and it is now time for the people of the Central African Republic and their elected representatives to continue the process of military and economic reform. Specifically, we would encourage further military restructuring, demobilization and strict adherence to the International Monetary Fund programme, which includes the regular payment of salaries to soldiers and other Government employees.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">MINURCA will end on 15 February 2000. The need for a smooth transition to non-assessed post-conflict institution-building is paramount, in our view. MINURCA's troops must begin to withdraw immediately. Departure cannot be delayed until the end of this extension. It is also vital that the United Nations take steps as soon as possible to formulate a programme for the United Nations and other international donors to support reform after MINURCA departs. It is similarly important that the Government of the Central African Republic should use the next three months to complete the implementation of stabilizing reforms. The future of the Central African Republic is in the hands of the Government and its people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">My Government has opposed extensions of MINURCA's mandate in the past. We are joining the consensus today, however, because we are committed to promoting peace and security throughout Africa as a means for enhancing development and economic growth. We hope that the President and the people of the Central African Republic can continue to make the necessary changes that will lead to lasting peace and stability.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Shen Guofang</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">Since the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1159(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1159 (1998)</a> last year, which authorized the establishment of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA), the situation in the Central African Republic has remained peaceful and stable. National reconciliation has achieved positive results and work on various fronts has been proceeding in a smooth and orderly manner.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">We have also noticed that various destabilizing factors still exist in the Central African Republic. National economic reconstruction and the restructuring of the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) are yet to begin.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">MINURCA's continued presence in the Central African Republic for a period of time is of course highly necessary. In this regard, the Chinese delegation fully supports the recommendation of the Secretary-General to extend the mission, as well as the draft resolution of the Council based on the Secretary-General's recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">We believe that the extension of the Mission and the future establishment of a United Nations office in Bangui will contribute to national reconciliation and economic reconstruction in the Central African Republic. The Chinese delegation will therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>
