<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Somalia, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council reaffirms all its previous statements and resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular the statement by its President of 15 March 2006 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-11.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/11</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council reiterates its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia and its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia, consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its strong support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. François Fall. The Security Council encourages Ambassador Fall and other United Nations agencies and offices to actively engage in the region to promote peace and stability. It calls upon all Member States to provide him their full support in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council supports the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP) as the internationally recognized authorities to restore peace, stability and governance to Somalia. It notes the importance for stability in Somalia of broad-based and representative institutions and of an inclusive political process, as envisaged in the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the agreement reached in Khartoum on 22 June between the TFG and the Islamic Courts, sent to the presidency of the Security Council on 29 June 2006 (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-442.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/442</a>). The Security Council commends the League of Arab States (LAS) for facilitating the talks. The Security Council condemns the recent fighting in Mogadishu and requests all parties to adhere to the ceasefire agreed on 22 June. In this regard, the Security Council emphasizes the importance of dialogue between the Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs) and the Islamic Courts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council therefore urges all parties involved in this dialogue to engage constructively at the next round of talks, scheduled for 15 July, where it looks forward to further progress in pursuit of a lasting political process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council requests all parties inside and outside of Somalia to refrain from action that could provoke or perpetuate violence and violations of human rights, endanger the ceasefire and political process, or further damage the humanitarian situation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council expresses its grave concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Somalia, and demands that all Somali leaders ensure complete and unhindered humanitarian access, as well as providing guarantees for the safety and security of the humanitarian aid workers in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council commends the African Union (AU) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) for their continuing efforts to promote peace and stability in Somalia and the region. The Council notes their meetings of 19 June and 28-29 June 2006, and welcomes the role of the AU/IGAD/LAS and European Union fact-finding mission to Somalia on 5-7 July 2006 in promoting peace, stability and a political process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council welcomes the meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the AU in Banjul on 5 July 2006, and notes that meeting's request for the Security Council to consider an exemption to the arms embargo imposed on Somalia by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-733(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 733 (1992)</a> of 23 January 1992, to pave way for a possible deployment of a Peace Support Mission (PSM) and to help facilitate the re-establishment of the national security forces of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council states its willingness, if it judges that a PSM would contribute to peace and stability in Somalia, to consider the above request for a PSM, on the basis of a detailed mission plan from IGAD or the AU.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council welcomes the fact that the TFG and the TFP were able to agree on 14 June 2006 to adopt the National Security and Stabilization Plan for Somalia. The Security Council believes that the adoption of a security plan is an important step towards providing a framework for effective security sector reform in Somalia, in order to help deliver peace for all Somalis.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">"The Security Council expresses its readiness to consider a limited modification of the arms embargo to enable the TFIs, on the basis of a sustainable peace process, to develop Somalia's security sector and national institutions capable of responding to security issues.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">"The Security Council emphasizes, however, the continued contribution made to Somalia's peace and security by the arms embargo, and calls on all to comply with it. The Security Council reiterates its intention to consider urgently how to strengthen the effectiveness of the arms embargo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">"The Security Council welcomes the outcome of the first meeting of the International Contact Group on Somalia."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-31.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/31</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa19">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
