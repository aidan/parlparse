	<div class="p"> The General Assembly will proceed to the election of eleven permanent judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for a four-year term of office commencing on 25 May 2003.</div>
	<div class="p">As members are aware, at the 52nd plenary meeting of the fifty-third session, held on 3 November 1998, the General Assembly elected the nine judges of all three Trial Chambers of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Their terms of office are due to expire on 24 May 2003.</div>
	<div class="p">By its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1329(2000)">resolution 1329 (2000)</a>, of 30 November 2000, the Security Council decided to increase the number of judges in the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. In order that the increase in the number of judges in the Appeals Chamber might be made, the Security Council also decided that two additional judges should be elected as soon as possible as judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and that the judges so elected should serve until the expiry of the terms of office of the judges currently serving on the Tribunal.</div>
	<div class="p">At the 99th plenary meeting of the fifty-fifth session, held on 24 April 2001, the General Assembly elected the two additional judges. The terms of office of the two additional judges so elected are also due to expire on 24 May 2003.</div>
	<div class="p">The election of the eleven permanent judges will take place in accordance with the relevant provisions of article 12 and article 12 bis of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended by the Security Council in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1431(2002)">resolution 1431 (2002)</a>, of 14 August 2002.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with article 12 bis, paragraph 1 (d), of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended by the Security Council, the Holy See, being a non-member State that maintains a permanent observer mission at United Nations Headquarters, will participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. I am happy to welcome here the representative of the Holy See.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with subparagraph 1 (c) of article 12 bis of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Security Council, at its 4666th meeting, held on 13 December 2002, established a list of 23 candidates for transmittal to the General Assembly. The list, which was adopted by the Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1449(2002)">resolution 1449 (2002)</a>, of 13 December 2002, was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by a letter dated 13 December 2002 from the President of the Security Council. The letter was issued as document <a href="../pdf/A-57-491">A/57/491</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Assembly to the other documents relating to the election.</div>
	<div class="p">The memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning the election of judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-492">A/57/492</a> and corrigendum 1. The list of candidates can be found in paragraph 11 of document <a href="../pdf/A-57-492">A/57/492</a>. The curricula vitae of the candidates are contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-493">A/57/493</a>. In that connection, I would like to bring to the Assembly's attention article 12 of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended, which stipulates that permanent judges of the Tribunal shall be persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices. According to the same provision, due account shall be taken in the overall composition of the Chambers of the Tribunal of the experience of the judges in criminal law and international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law.</div>
	<div class="p">Also in connection with this election, I would like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly the following. Given the similar nature of the election of judges of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, it was decided at the time of the elections of judges in 1995, 1998 and 2001 to follow similar election procedures in the General Assembly. In his memorandum contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-492">A/57/492</a>, the Secretary-General suggests, in paragraph 12 (b), that those precedents be followed and that rule 151 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly be applied to the election of permanent judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p">Unless I hear any objection, I shall take it that the Assembly agrees to that suggestion.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">In accordance with paragraph 1 (d) of article 12 bis of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended, the candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the non-member State shall be declared elected. The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose, are all 191 Member States, together with the non-member State the Holy See. Accordingly, 97 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of the present election.</div>
	<div class="p">If, in the first ballot, the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than 11, a second ballot will be held, and balloting will continue in the same meeting, if and as necessary, until 11 candidates have obtained an absolute majority. In any second or subsequent ballot, each elector may vote for no more than 11 candidates, less the number of candidates who have already obtained absolute majorities.</div>
	<div class="p">Following the practice in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, the Secretary-General suggests in his memorandum that any second or subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted. Votes may accordingly be cast in any second or subsequent ballot for any eligible candidate who has not yet obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p">It is further suggested that, following the practice in the election of the judges of the International Court of Justice, if more than 11 candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will be held on all candidates, and balloting will continue at the same meeting, if and as necessary, until 11 candidates, and no more, have obtained an absolute majority.</div>

In consideration of its specific nature and its objectives, and in accordance with the recognized practices in similar cases, the Holy See, although invited to participate in the voting process, has decided, as in previous occasions, to abstain from casting its votes on the individual candidates for the office of judge of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>

	<div class="p">As members will undoubtedly recall, at the opening of the 80th plenary meeting of the General Assembly this morning, I informed members that certain Member States had made the necessary payments to reduce their arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter. The General Assembly decided to take note of that information. Pursuant to that decision, the States concerned participated in the three rounds of balloting that have taken place today.</div>
	<div class="p">Unfortunately, I have now been informed that one of those States has not in fact made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter. In view of this situation, I have extensively consulted with the Office of Legal Affairs. I deeply regret to inform representatives that the first ballot, and so, necessarily, the second and third ballots also, are invalid. Consequently, the candidates who were announced as elected can no longer be so considered.</div>
	<div class="p">In view of this -- allow me to say -- highly unfortunate situation, I would propose to the Assembly that the elections should commence anew on Friday, 31 January, at 10 a.m. This will allow delegations to receive instructions from their capitals.</div>
	<div class="p">Since the elections must commence again, it naturally follows that the withdrawals that were announced today are also to be considered as not having been made. The elections will therefore be conducted on the basis of the full list of 23 candidates whose names appear in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-492">A/57/492</a> and corrigendum 1. States may, of course, communicate the withdrawal of candidates to the Secretariat prior to Friday's election.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">As you are all undoubtedly fully aware, we are soon to proceed to a new election of 11 permanent judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. This is the result of my ruling last Wednesday. Since then, I have received six protests from permanent missions of the countries whose judges were elected on Wednesday in the first round and whose elections were later declared invalid.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me stress from the outset that I fully sympathize with the dismay and frustration felt by these and probably many more delegates. For example, I fully agree with the representative of the United Republic of Tanzania that we need to obtain "a full accounting, step by step, of what transpired and who was responsible". I would also like to assure the Permanent Representative of Turkey that I deal with this matter with utmost seriousness.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me summarize what happened on Wednesday, given the information available to me to date. As you are surely aware, at the opening of the 80th plenary meeting of the General Assembly on Wednesday morning, I informed representatives that certain Member States had made the necessary payments to reduce their arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations. The General Assembly took note of information that was not correct. The Assembly then proceeded in good faith to conduct three rounds of balloting on the supposition that the information that had been conveyed to it was correct. Unfortunately, it was not. Most unfortunately, the information that the Secretariat had given to me, and which I had transmitted to representatives, was erroneous. As we are all now aware, one of the States concerned had not, in fact, made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.</div>
	<div class="p">I was informed of this situation while the votes cast in the third round of balloting were being counted. When I received this information, I was astonished, to put it mildly and diplomatically. I immediately sought the advice of the Office of Legal Affairs. Having obtained the advice of that Office, I informed the Assembly that the first ballot, and so necessarily the second and third ballots also, were invalid. In consequence, the candidates who were announced as having obtained absolute majorities could no longer be considered to have obtained those majorities. The Charter had been violated. For the first time in the history of the United Nations, elections took place in which the rules embodied in the United Nations basic document, the Charter of the United Nations, were violated.</div>
	<div class="p">We do not have a precedent that could help us to move on. Let me stress that since we are now establishing the precedent for any future elections, we must proceed in the most responsible and sensitive way, being fully aware of the consequences.</div>
	<div class="p">As I said earlier, yesterday I received communications from six delegations in which representatives expressed their deep concern about the situation. Let me inform you that I have written a letter to Under-Secretary-General Catherine Bertini, the head of the Secretariat's Department of Management, requesting a full and objective investigation that will be reported to Member States. In that letter, I made clear my deep dismay and also the fact that I am aware of the effect that the erroneous information provided by the Secretariat could have on the final outcome of the elections, and also of the political implications, not to mention, of course, financial costs arising from the extra meetings of the General Assembly. I also requested that the investigation report should include a recommendation on measures which should be adopted to prevent such a situation ever recurring in the future.</div>
	<div class="p">However, I am absolutely sure -- and here I would like to refer to the letter sent to me by Mr. Hans Corell, Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs, the Legal Counsel, which I asked to be distributed to all of you -- that we took the right decision as we declared the results of the Wednesday election invalid. The mandates of the judges must be legitimate without any doubt whatsoever. No mandate can be legitimate if the Charter is violated during the election.</div>
	<div class="p">I call upon all the representatives to consider all the aspects of this difficult situation. The dignity of the General Assembly, as well as the dignity of the United Nations, is at risk.</div>
	<div class="p">Regrettably, I have to admit the conditions of this morning's elections are not exactly the same as they were on Wednesday. But let us not forget that the most important criterion for the election is stated in accordance with article 12 of the Statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda as it was adopted by Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-955(1994)">resolution 955 (1994)</a>: "The judges shall be persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity." During a time of crisis, we must stick to the rules that we ourselves have created.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me also say that I understand the sentiment expressed by the Permanent Representative of the Argentine Republic, who, in a letter sent to me, expressed his anxiety that today's new elections might result in an outcome different from that of the first round of elections, which took place on Wednesday. We must all unite in our determination to preserve the legitimacy of United Nations elections, as I have made clear.</div>
	<div class="p">I have absolutely no intention to interfere in any way with the sovereign right of each delegation to vote in the way it sees fit. But allow me to express my personal hope that delegations will vote today in the same way as they did on Wednesday, thus ensuring that the results will be the same. I am sure that that would meet with everyone's approval.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly should continue with the election of 11 permanent judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. First, however, several representatives have requested the floor.</div>

	<div class="p">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States (GRULAC) with reference to the unfortunate decision of 29 January regarding the elections for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. I must state that GRULAC is united in its profound concern about a matter that was not brought to this body before a decision was made, reportedly based on legal expertise. For the General Assembly not to be involved in the solution of any unforeseen circumstance that arises during an election, and for a decision to be taken devoid of any input from this body, sets a dangerous precedent. As such, that decision should be reversed.</div>
	<div class="p">In this instance, with specific regard to the six countries elected on the first ballot, the legal principle by which the outcome of an election is determined is the following. If there is an irregularity in the electoral process, the question to be asked is, could such an irregularity have affected the outcome of the election with respect to a particular candidate? If the answer to that question is no, then the election of that candidate is not affected by such an irregularity and the election of that candidate stands. That is a bedrock principle. Again, I speak on behalf of a solidified and united group of 33 States.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">We took note of the decision that the President just explained to us, and we very much appreciate the fact that, in this very difficult situation, he tried to take a decision truly aimed at upholding the principles of the Charter. On the other hand, we very much understand the reasons that were just set forth by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda.</div>
	<div class="p">The President himself said that there is no precedent for such a situation, and I wonder whether it is truly correct that the only decision that is possible, according to the Secretariat and its legal adviser, would be to return to the first ballot and to repeat the electoral process. I understand that three candidates -- three judges -- have confirmed their decision to withdraw from the elections. Under those circumstances, it cannot be the same electoral process.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition -- I have not verified this yet, but I understand that we do not fulfil the requirement that there must be twice as many candidates as available seats for elections. And I wonder whether it would be possible, under these circumstances, to arrive at a very pragmatic solution that solves this problem and supports our common goal of making the Court as efficient as possible and not hampering it in its future work. I would suggest that the President consult first with the 22 countries that had presented a candidate and find out whether it would be possible for us to continue with the third ballot at the point at which the elections were interrupted.</div>
	<div class="p">So my suggestion would be that we find out whether a pragmatic solution is possible. The General Assembly is the master of its own ceremonies, and I think we can take a decision that takes into account the prerequisites of Article 19 of the Charter by deciding that we can continue with the third ballot, particularly in light of the fact that no candidate on the first two ballots was elected with a slim majority of only one vote.</div>

For the sake of the dignity of this body, and for the sake of your authority, Mr. President, I should like to ask you to reconsider the decision that has been made, because the explanations and descriptions provided by the Secretariat are simplifying the implications of that unfortunate outcome. If we accept such an interpretation, that would mean that we would contravene our sovereign right to vote. That would have more serious implications than to state when the error was made, to locate it and to hold to account those who made such an error, which has such serious political implications for the Assembly.</div>

	<div class="p">At the opening of the plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the morning of 29 January, the President of the Assembly provided information on countries that had made the necessary payments to reduce their arrears, without specifying the amounts, in accordance with Article 19 of the Charter. Consequently, the Assembly decided to take note of that decision, which enabled those Member States to vote in the Assembly. However, after three rounds of voting, which resulted in the election of six of the candidates on the first ballot, we heard the President's declaration that the results of the elections were invalidated, as one of the States concerned had not actually made the required payment. The reasons that led to that invalidation of the election results were not adequately disclosed. It is the right of each Member State to be informed in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p">Belatedly -- in fact, a few minutes ago -- the President provided us with the relevant information. Thus, a re-election is being imposed on the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">It is not that any Member State has scruples about elections, but we are concerned that a dangerous precedent could be established by nullifying a democratically achieved election. Invalidating this result is also tantamount to a distortion of the free will of Member States. Might not that decision inadvertently pave the way for unforeseeable abuses in future elections?</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to the psychological implications of this decision. From now, a shadow of doubt will be cast over every election that takes place in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">I hope that, in view of these concerns and considerations, every possible measure will be taken to prevent a recurrence of such mismanagement.</div>

	Mr. Listre (Argentina)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Allow me at the outset to express to you, in your capacity as President, my sympathy, appreciation and respect, in the context of the unfortunate situation facing the General Assembly, the Member States and you yourself, for reasons beyond your control.</div>
	<div class="p">We are in a situation in which a nullification, invoked during an electoral process, is attempting to annul an entire process in which States had cast their votes in good faith. Three electoral rounds had already been carried out, and voting was suspended. The President of the General Assembly, in my opinion, on bad legal advice, decided to annul a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">With all due respect, I believe that the General Assembly should be the sole judge of its actions. Only the General Assembly itself can arrive at the decision that a vote taken by the Assembly is null and void. No other authority -- neither the President of the General Assembly, nor the opinion of the Secretary-General or the legal opinion of the Secretariat -- can supersede the sovereign will of the General Assembly. Let me stress that point: the Assembly is the sole judge of its own actions.</div>
	<div class="p">But I believe that we have to try to deal with this situation in good faith, in good order, in the spirit of safeguarding the prestige of the General Assembly and of preserving the authority of its President and harmony among its members.</div>
	<div class="p">I believe, therefore, that in this situation we can apply the concepts that have just been pointed out, with good reason and common sense, by the Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda. In the face of an invalid act, the first question we must address is: Would declaring it invalid change the act itself? Would the nature of the act be the same, or could it be corrected? The answer is no: declaring it invalid would not change the validity of the act or its result. Therefore the act can be ratified. Who can ratify it? The General Assembly. No other authority can declare it either null and void, or valid.</div>
	<div class="p">Also, in practical terms, I would suggest to the Assembly that it use the criterion proposed by the representative of Germany -- that is to say, that it declare valid the outcome of the three votes that were held; that the third-round votes be counted; that the Assembly be informed; and that we proceed to a new round of voting with the new members that can vote, excluding those that cannot do so.</div>

	<div class="p">My country, as one of the States affected by the invalidation of the election results announced on 29 January, still believes that the invalidation was wrongly done by the President. Tanzania believes that the President should have first consulted with the General Assembly before adopting that ruling. It is the General Assembly, not the President or the Secretary-General, that is the final judge of any considerations related to the countries that were announced as entitled to vote, and the consequences thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">The decision to invalidate the whole election is causing major harm. To say that it is a procedural effect that is not the responsibility of the Member States, in particular of those that were elected, is a grave and irresponsible attack on the legitimate rights of the elected candidates.</div>
	<div class="p">Once again, my delegation is very anxious to have a full account of what transpired before and after the second ballot which led to the invalidation of the ballot. The nullification of the election results long after they have been certified is unprecedented. It is important, therefore, to have a step-by-step full accounting before a first step is taken lest we fall into the same trap.</div>

	<div class="p">In the same letter, I also noted that, although the intention that underpins it is understandable, that decision does a great disservice to the six judges already elected, including the candidate from Senegal, and could amount to an attack on the sovereignty of the General Assembly itself.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="The President" nation="" language="">

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Let me briefly respond to what has been said.</div>
	<div class="p">I duly note the sentiments expressed by the Permanent Representatives of the countries who sent me the letters which I mentioned in my introductory remarks and which are the countries whose members were elected as judges in the first round on Wednesday morning. I made clear in my introductory remarks that I fully understand their sentiments. I would like to reassure the representative of Saint Kitts and Nevis that it was never my intention to penalize any of the candidates.</div>
	<div class="p">I also said in my introductory remarks that I fully understand the request of the United Republic of Tanzania for a step-by-step full account of what transpired and made clear that I have already asked for such a report to be prepared and made available to Member States.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to assure the Permanent Representative of Turkey that I am fully aware that the situation can lead to a dangerous precedent. I am also aware of the psychological implications, but I am fully determined to ensure that no shadow of any kind will be cast over any future United Nations elections. The fact, however regrettable, is that on Wednesday the elections took place in violation, albeit unwittingly, of Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations. We have to take that into account. As I have said, we should respect the rules we have ourselves created; otherwise, this could cast that shadow over future United Nations elections.</div>
	<div class="p">I listened carefully to what the representative of Germany proposed, which he called a pragmatic decision. Let me share with the General Assembly my personal sentiment that, if a pragmatic decision could be found that would also square with the legal requirements and the legal analysis of what happened, I for one would be extremely happy. However, I have to refer to the legal analysis which was supplied to me by Hans Corell and which I made available to the Assembly -- that is, the elections were correctly to be described as invalid because they took place while the United Nations Charter was violated.</div>
	<div class="p">If I understood correctly the remark made by the representative of Germany, he claimed that no candidate elected was elected by the small majority of one. That is not the case. There was such a small majority. Therefore, there is a possibility that, if the State that voted in violation of the rules had not voted, the outcome could have been different. Unfortunately, the figures are such. Rather than discriminate against that one judge, the legal opinion of the Legal Counsel of the United Nations was that it is regrettable but inevitable, in order to fulfil and respect our rules and not to discriminate against anyone, that we declare those elections invalid and start again.</div>
	<div class="p">I fully agree with the representative of the Argentine Republic that it is the General Assembly that is the sole and only judge and I have no intention of not respecting the decision of the General Assembly. If the General Assembly wishes to overturn my ruling, which was based -- as was acknowledged by many of the speakers -- on the legal analysis of the Legal Counsel of the United Nations, it is the perfect right of the General Assembly to do so and I am obviously prepared fully to respect that. As the representative of the Argentine Republic said, the General Assembly is the sole and only judge and it is up to the General Assembly to make the decision that it deems appropriate.</div>
	<div class="p">From that point of view, I understand from legal advice that, out of the speeches which were made this morning, the contribution of the representative of the Argentine Republic should be interpreted as a challenge to the President's ruling. I would also be very grateful to the representative of Antigua and Barbuda, who spoke first this morning on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, if he could confirm that it was his intention to challenge my ruling under rule 71 of the rules of procedure, so that we can proceed according to the letter of the procedure.</div>

It seems to me, looking at the very unequivocal advice that was received from the Legal Counsel, that you, Mr. President, had very little option but to proceed on the basis of that advice. But I also understand very well the concerns that have been raised by delegations, and you as President have indicated that you understand those concerns very well.</div>
	<div class="p">I think that the proposal by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda is a very sound one. Could I suggest, however, that the meeting, rather than being the representatives of the regional groups, might be a meeting of the Bureau, perhaps with the Legal Counsel, given the difficulty that some of the regional groups have in actually participating in discussions of substance. It also seems to me that if you convened a meeting of the Bureau you would have a very wide range of views and experience to draw upon and indeed that this is appropriately a collective responsibility for the Bureau as a whole to shoulder, rather than you as President to have to shoulder, particularly in light of the advice which you received.</div>

	<div class="p">My delegation does not challenge the President. It is prepared to find a practical solution that, of course, conforms to legality. But fundamentally, it is a political decision, which the Assembly must take. And I consider it very opportune to support the proposal of the representative of New Zealand that we hold consultations with the Bureau of the General Assembly and the chairmen of the regional groups. A decision can be taken, and then the Secretary-General can be consulted for his opinion.</div>

	<div class="p">As I see no other representative asking for the floor, let me make the following decision.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to suspend this meeting until 3 o'clock this afternoon. I would like to ask the members of the Bureau to meet at 12 o'clock in Conference Room 1. I would also like to ask the chairmen of the respective regional groups to attend the meeting of the Bureau, if they wish. The meeting is open to them. I will also ask the Legal Counsel of the United Nations to attend that consultative meeting, at noon in Conference Room 1.</div>
	<div class="p">This meeting of the General Assembly is now suspended until 3 p.m., by which time I hope we will have found a solution that is both pragmatic and legal.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Let me briefly summarize for the Assembly the lengthy discussions we have had in the informal consultations of the Bureau, which were also attended by a number of other representatives.</div>
	<div class="p">A point was stressed by a number of representatives that, however difficult the situation may be, in finding a solution to it we should not put aside rules which do not suit us in any expedient manner. It was stressed that it is highly important for us to follow the rules which we have set for ourselves and agreed upon.</div>
	<div class="p">There was a warning shared by many that a course of action should be avoided by the General Assembly which could lead in some undefined future to a possible contestation of any decision taken by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, when someone who may not like such a decision could contest the legitimacy of the elections. That would be highly, highly unfortunate and it would create a very dangerous precedent.</div>
	<div class="p">It was made clear -- and I would like to reiterate publicly here -- that the problem which has arisen has not been in any way caused by the delegation of the Member State of Mauritania. I would like to assure all members of the General Assembly that the Government of Mauritania acted in complete compliance with the information which was supplied to me by the Secretariat and which I then conveyed to the Assembly on Wednesday morning. The Government of Mauritania therefore acted in good faith and is in no way responsible for the situation that is before us.</div>
	<div class="p">During the debate of the Bureau, one question was formulated and addressed via me to the Legal Counsel of the United Nations. The question was motivated by our shared desire to find an answer to our problem that will be both practical and legal -- a sentiment and approach which I share. The question was whether it would be possible -- whether legally it is in any way possible -- to waive retroactively the application of Article 19 for one Member State -- that is, Mauritania -- and for one election -- that is, the one that took place on Wednesday. The question was then passed to the Legal Counsel, Mr. Hans Corell. After a suspension of our meeting for over an hour, Mr. Corell came with a written response, which will be read out to the Assembly in full by the representative of the Secretariat in a minute. Let me tell the Assembly that the gist of the conclusion is that, unfortunately, from the legal point of view, such a course of action is not really open to us -- or rather, is not recommended by the Legal Counsel.</div>
	<div class="p">The conclusion, which will be read out to you by Mr. Chen, of course cannot be other than that the matter is in front of the General Assembly and it is solely on the General Assembly to make the final decision. I, and others, will fully abide by and respect the Assembly's decision. But before making a decision, the Assembly should be given all the information as it has been made available to the Bureau.</div>
	<div class="p">I was asked to convey to you the feeling of the members of the Bureau after we were acquainted with the legal advice put forward by Mr. Corell. The Bureau agreed that no other course of action was open to me on Wednesday than the one which I regrettably had to take following the legal advice when I made the ruling that that election was invalid.</div>
	<div class="p">I appreciated the support and also regret that we did not have this discussion on Wednesday. On the other hand, the fact that I have postponed the election until today allowed you time to consult among yourselves and with your capitals. It was also possible for us to obtain more information from the lawyers, because we were as surprised as all of you by the situation which suddenly occurred on Wednesday.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me conclude by acknowledging that clearly many delegations quite understandably wished to find a way in which the outcome of the Wednesday elections could be declared valid. But, at the same time, everybody made very clear that we do not want to pay the price of not abiding by the United Nations Charter and the other rules and regulations which the General Assembly had agreed upon. Therefore, my own opinion is the same as I set out here this morning. The best way of accommodating the fully understandable -- and I stress, fully understandable -- political concerns expressed by many of you while abiding by the United Nations Charter and other existing rules is to repeat the elections and vote in the same way as on Wednesday and to ensure that the results will not be different today than they were on Wednesday. You would elect, from among the eleven judges, the six who received an absolute majority on Wednesday. I very much hope that this will be the case.</div>
	<div class="p">I would now like to ask the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management to take the floor on behalf of the Secretariat.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="14-5">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Chen Jian" nation="" language="">
	Mr. Chen Jian
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">My statement will have two parts: to give a brief statement on behalf of the Secretariat, and to convey to you the opinion of the Legal Counsel.</div>
	<div class="p">First of all, on behalf of the Secretariat, I should like to express to you, Mr. President, and to the members of the General Assembly our deepest apologies and most sincere regrets for the unfortunate error made by members of the Secretariat. This mistake has caused a great deal of stress for delegations, in particular for those who were directly involved in the elections. For this we express our deep regret. I would also like to promise you that there will be a thorough investigation into the situation surrounding the error. As a result of this inquiry we will be in a position to propose effective measures to ensure that such mistakes will not occur in the future.</div>
	<div class="p">Now, I will convey the opinion of the Legal Counsel on the question, and I will read from a text provided:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The General Committee has asked that I" -- meaning the Legal Counsel, to be understood as such henceforth -- "review a suggestion to cure the invalidity that currently affects three rounds of balloting for permanent judges of the ICTR that were held on 29 January 2003. That suggestion was motivated by the undeniable fact that the error was the fault of the Secretariat. Accordingly, it was suggested that there was a need for flexibility to respect the sovereignty of Member States, which had voted in good faith.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Let me first note that I stand by the advice that I gave to the President on Wednesday. That advice has been circulated to you all.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The suggestion to retroactively cure the invalidity in the election process is based on a proposal to apply the last sentence of Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations. That sentence reads as follows:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"`The General Assembly may, nevertheless, permit such a Member to vote if it is satisfied that the failure to pay is due to conditions beyond the control of the Member.'</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"From a legal point of view, the difficulty with this suggestion is that the Charter itself permits such a waiver only in one defined circumstance, specifically when `the failure of the Member to pay is due to conditions beyond the control of the Member'.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"If the suggestion made were to be accepted, the General Assembly would have to state, in an explicit decision, that it was acting in accordance with Article 19 and so make it clear that its decision was taken on the grounds that it was satisfied that the failure of the State concerned to make the payment required to bring its arrears below the amount specified in the first sentence of Article 19 was `due to conditions beyond the control of the Member'. The conclusion that this ground applies in the specific case in hand, would, moreover, have to be limited to the specific date in question, since the suggestion, as I understand it, is to retroactively validate only the three ballots that took place on Wednesday, 29 January 2003.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The General Assembly has decided to confer upon the Committee on Contributions the responsibility of advising it on the action to be taken with regard to the application of Article 19 of the Charter. See rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"In the present case, if the suggestion were accepted, the General Assembly would have to retroactively suspend the application of rule 160.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"In the very limited time available, we have made a quick examination of the way in which Article 19 of the Charter and rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly have been applied in practice.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The information set out below indicates that the General Assembly has, on occasion, waived the strict requirement of rule 160 and has permitted a State to vote in advance of, or without, any consideration of its case by the Committee on Contributions.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"`In 1968, Haiti was explicitly authorized, after it had invoked the factual requirements  of  Art.  19,  clause  2,  to participate in voting until the Committee on Contributions had given its opinion. A similar authorization was accorded to Yemen in 1971 when, as indicated by the representative of that country, a remittance in the necessary amount had already been dispatched but had not yet reached the UN. A similar procedure was adopted in 1973 when the GA, in the opening meeting of the 28th session on September 18, 1973, authorized Bolivia, the Central African Republic, Guinea and Paraguay to participate in voting after assurances had been given that the amount due had already been dispatched. Out of these States, Bolivia and later the Central African Republic contended at the same time that the delay was related to circumstances beyond their control.'"</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"The quotation comes from the book <i>The Charter of the United Nations</i>, by Bruno Simma.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"In all these cases, the waiver was granted prospectively, before any voting took place. In no case that we have been able to identify has the General Assembly retroactively made a decision to grant a waiver under Article 19.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"In view of the above, I, as a lawyer and as Legal Counsel of the United Nation, could not advocate the course of action that has been suggested.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"At the same time, I would note that the matter is properly before the General Assembly, which has the power to take a final decision in the matter."</div>
	<div class="blockquote">That ends the note from the Legal Counsel.</div>

	<div class="p">I thank the representative of the Argentine Republic -- in particular, in this difficult situation -- for understanding the position I have taken.</div>
	<div class="p">As I see no other Member State asking for the floor, the General Assembly will continue with the election of 11 permanent judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p">As members are aware, at the 52nd plenary meeting of the fifty-third session, held on 3 November 1998, the General Assembly elected the nine judges of all three Trial Chambers of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Their terms of office are due to expire on 24 May 2003.</div>
	<div class="p">By its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1329(2000)">resolution 1329 (2000)</a>, of 30 November 2000, the Security Council decided to increase the number of judges in the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. In order that the increase in the number of judges in the Appeals Chamber might be made, the Security Council also decided that two additional judges should be elected as soon as possible as judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and that the judges so elected should serve until the expiry of the terms of office of the judges currently serving on the Tribunal.</div>
	<div class="p">At the 99th plenary meeting of the fifty-fifth session, held on 24 April 2001, the General Assembly elected the two additional judges. The terms of office of the two additional judges so elected are also due to expire on 24 May 2003.</div>
	<div class="p">The election of the 11 permanent judges will take place in accordance with the relevant provisions of article 12 and article 12 bis of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended by the Security Council in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1431(2002)">resolution 1431 (2002)</a>, of 14 August 2002.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with article 12 bis, paragraph 1 (d), of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, amended by the Security Council, I had the pleasure on Wednesday, 29 January, of welcoming the Holy See, being a non-Member State which maintains a permanent observer mission at United Nations Headquarters, to participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with subparagraph 1 (c) of article 12 bis of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Security Council, at its 4666th meeting, on 13 December 2002, established a list of 23 candidates for transmittal to the General Assembly. The list, adopted by the Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1449(2002)">resolution 1449 (2002)</a>, of 13 December 2002, was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by a letter dated 13 December 2002 from the President of the Security Council. The letter was issued as document <a href="../pdf/A-57-491">A/57/491</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">The memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning the election of judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-492">A/57/492</a> and Corrigendum 1. The list of candidates can be found in paragraph 11 of document <a href="../pdf/A-57-492">A/57/492</a> and Corrigendum 1.</div>
	<div class="p">At this time, I would like to announce that the Permanent Mission of Ghana and the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Moldova to the United Nations have informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations by notes verbales dated 30 January 2003 that Mr. Emile Francis Short of Ghana and Mr. Xenofon Ulianovschi of the Republic of Moldova no longer wish to be considered as candidates. I have also been informed by the representative of Georgia that Mr. Teimuraz Bakradze of Georgia no longer wishes to be a candidate. Accordingly, those names have been deleted from the ballot paper.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to ask, are there any further withdrawals at this stage? As I see no such indication, let us continue.</div>
	<div class="p">The curricula vitae of the candidates are contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-493">A/57/493</a>. In that connection, may I bring to the Assembly's attention article 12 of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended, which stipulates that permanent judges of the Tribunal shall be persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices. According to the same provision, due account shall be taken in the overall composition of the Chambers of the Tribunal of the experience of the judges in criminal law and international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to recall that, in his memorandum, the Secretary-General suggested that, given the similar nature of the election of judges of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and as was decided at the time of the elections of judges in 1995, 1998 and 2001, similar election procedures should be followed in the Assembly. The General Assembly, on Wednesday, 29 January 2003, decided that those precedents shall be followed and that rule 151 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly shall be applied to the election of permanent judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with paragraph 1 (d) of article 12 bis of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended, the candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the non-member State shall be declared elected. The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose, are all 191 Member States, together with the non-member State, the Holy See. Accordingly, 97 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of the present election.</div>
	<div class="p">If, in the first ballot, the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than 11, a second ballot will be held, and balloting will continue in the same meeting, if and as necessary, until 11 candidates have obtained an absolute majority. In any second or subsequent ballot, each elector may vote for no more than 11 candidates, less the number of candidates who have already obtained absolute majorities.</div>
	<div class="p">I also wish to recall that, on Wednesday, the General Assembly decided that any second or subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted. Votes may accordingly be cast in any second or subsequent ballot for any eligible candidate who has not yet obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, the Assembly further decided that, if more than 11 candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will be held on all candidates, and balloting will continue at the same meeting, if and as necessary, until 11 candidates, and no more, have obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly,</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"After the President has announced the beginning of voting, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order in connection with the actual conduct of the voting."</div>
	<div class="p">Therefore, any announcements such as those concerning withdrawals of candidatures should be made prior to the commencement of the voting process -- that is to say, before the announcement of the beginning of the voting process.</div>
	<div class="p">We shall now begin the voting process. Ballot papers will now be distributed.</div>
	<div class="p">I request representatives to use only those ballot papers that are being distributed. Representatives may vote for no more than 11 candidates. Only those candidates whose names appear on the ballot papers are eligible for election. Representatives will indicate the 11 candidates for whom they wish to vote by placing crosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers. Ballot papers on which more than 11 names are marked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names appear on the ballot papers.</div>
