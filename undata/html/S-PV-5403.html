	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and recalls the right of States parties, in conformity with Articles I and II of that Treaty, to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council notes with serious concern the many reports and resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) related to Iran's nuclear programme, reported to it by the IAEA Director General, including the February resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors <i>(GOV/2006/14)</i>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council also notes with serious concern that the Director General's report of 27 February 2006 <i>(GOV/2006/15)</i> lists a number of outstanding issues and concerns, including topics which could have a military nuclear dimension, and that the IAEA is unable to conclude that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council notes with serious concern Iran's decision to resume enrichment-related activities, including research and development, and to suspend cooperation with the IAEA under the Additional Protocol.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council calls upon Iran to take the steps required by the IAEA Board of Governors, notably in operative paragraph 1 of its resolution <i>(GOV/2006/14)</i>, which are essential to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful purpose of its nuclear programme, and to resolve outstanding questions, and underlines, in this regard, the particular importance of re-establishing full and sustained suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development, to be verified by the IAEA.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council expresses the conviction that such suspension and full, verified Iranian compliance with the requirements set out by the IAEA Board of Governors would contribute to a diplomatic, negotiated solution that guarantees that Iran's nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful purposes, and underlines the willingness of the international community to work positively for such a solution, which will also benefit nuclear non-proliferation elsewhere.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council strongly supports the role of the IAEA Board of Governors, and commends and encourages the Director General of the IAEA and its Secretariat for their ongoing professional and impartial efforts to resolve outstanding issues in Iran, and underlines the necessity of the IAEA continuing its work to clarify all outstanding issues relating to Iran's nuclear programme.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council requests in 30 days a report from the Director General of the IAEA on the process of Iranian compliance with the steps required by the IAEA Board, to the IAEA Board of Governors and in parallel to the Security Council for its consideration."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-15.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/15</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
