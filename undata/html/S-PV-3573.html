	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1009(1995).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1009 (1995)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-1995-730.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/730</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General of 23 August 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-730.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/730</a>) submitted pursuant to its resolution 1009 of 10 August 1995 on Croatia and in particular the humanitarian situation and human rights violations described therein.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the grave situation of refugees and persons displaced during the Croatian offensive and at reports</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">of violations of international humanitarian law as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 23 August 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-730.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/730</a>). The Council shares the view of the Secretary-General that the mass exodus of the local Serb population has created a humanitarian crisis of significant proportions. The Council is also concerned by reports of human rights violations including the burning of houses, looting of property and killings and demands that the Government of Croatia immediately investigate all such reports and take appropriate measures to put an end to such acts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its demand that the Government of the Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the local Serb population including their right to remain or return in safety.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council welcomes efforts made by the Secretary-General in coordination with international humanitarian organizations in response to this acute humanitarian situation. It calls upon all Member States to provide urgent humanitarian relief and assistance to these refugees and displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates that all those who commit violations of international humanitarian law will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts. The Council reiterates in this context that all States shall cooperate fully with the International Tribunal established pursuant to its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-827(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 827 (1993)</a> and its organs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-44.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/44</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
