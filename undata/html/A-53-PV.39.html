	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa01">The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of three judges to an additional Trial Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa02">By its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1166(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1166 (1998)</a> of 13 May 1998, the Security Council decided to establish a third Trial Chamber of the International Tribunal. It also decided that three additional judges should be elected as soon as possible to serve in the additional Trial Chamber and that the judges so elected should serve until the date of expiry of the terms of office of the judges currently serving on the Tribunal, that is, until 16 November 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa03">In connection with the election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa04">First, in accordance with article 13, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the International Tribunal, the three judges of the third Trial Chamber of the International Tribunal shall be elected by the General Assembly from a list of candidates submitted by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa05">At its 3919th meeting, on 27 August 1998, the Security Council, in accordance with article 13, subparagraph 2 (c) of the Statute of the International Tribunal, established in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1191(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1191 (1998)</a> a list of nine candidates, taking due account of the adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the world. The list was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by a letter dated 27 August 1998 from the President of the Security Council. The letter was issued as <a href="../pdf/A-52-1023.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/1023</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa06">Secondly, in accordance with article 13, subparagraph 2 (d), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, the Holy See and Switzerland, being non-member States, shall participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. On this occasion, I am happy to welcome here the representatives of the Holy See and Switzerland.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa07">Finally, I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning the election of judges of the International Tribunal is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-351.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/351</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa08">The list of candidates is to be found in paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/A-53-351.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/351</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa09">The curricula vitae of the candidates are to be found in <a href="../pdf/A-53-352.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/352</a>. In that connection, may I bring to the Assembly's attention article 13, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Tribunal, which reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa10">"The judges shall be persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices. In the overall composition of the Chambers due account shall be taken of the experience of the judges in criminal law, international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law."</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa11">As representatives know, the election of judges will take place in accordance with the relevant provisions of article 13 of the Statute of the International Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa12">In addition, given the similar nature of the election of judge of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the International Tribunal, it was decided at the time of the previous elections of judges, in 1993 and 1997, to follow similar election procedures in the General Assembly. In his memorandum, the Secretary-General suggests that this precedent be applied to the election of judges of the third Trial Chamber of the International Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk10-pa13">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to that suggestion?</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg002-bk01">
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">It was so decided.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Acting President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">In accordance with article 13, subparagraph 2 (d), of the Statute of the International Tribunal, the candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the non-member States maintaining permanent observer missions at United Nations Headquarters shall be declared elected.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose, are all 185 Member States and the two non-member States, namely the Holy See and Switzerland.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">Accordingly, 94 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of electing judges of the International Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa04">If in the first ballot the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than three, a second ballot will be held, and balloting will continue in the same meeting, if and as necessary, until three candidates have obtained an absolute majority. In any second or subsequent ballot, each elector may vote for no more than three candidates less the number of candidates who have already obtained absolute majorities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa05">Following the practice in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, the Secretary-General suggests in his memorandum that subsequent balloting should be unrestricted -- I repeat, that subsequent balloting should be unrestricted. Votes may accordingly be cast in any second or subsequent ballot for an eligible candidate who has not yet obtained an absolute majority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa06">It is further suggested that if in the first ballot more than the required number of candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes, a second ballot will be held on all candidates, and balloting will continue at the same meeting until the required number of candidates, and no more, obtain an absolute majority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa07">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to the procedures I have just outlined?</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tello</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Once again, the delegation of Mexico will not participate in the election of judges of the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Mexico has consistently held that, in establishing that Tribunal, the Security Council acted beyond its sphere of competence, since the Charter of the United Nations contains no explicit provision giving the Council the authority to create jurisdictional organs of this nature.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Mexico remains convinced that, once it is operational, the International Criminal Court, which was indeed established in conformity with the norms of international law, will render the creation of new special tribunals unnecessary.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">This position notwithstanding, Mexico will continue to pay in timely fashion its assessed financial contribution to the Tribunal, strictly abiding by the decisions that the General Assembly has adopted on this matter.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Monsignor Panikulam</span> <span class="non-nation">Holy See</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">The Holy See has closely followed the process leading to the establishment of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">The Holy See, and especially Pope John Paul II, has unceasingly worked for the cessation of hostilities, the reconciliation of the parties and international humanitarian solidarity with all the victims, and has without any distinction condemned in the strongest terms the perpetrators of crimes, holding them responsible not only before the tribunal of God but also in the courts of human justice. From the beginning of the conflict, the Holy See has supported, especially within the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the principle of the personal responsibility of the parties, and it therefore welcomes today the establishment of the International Tribunal as an instrument of the international community to express its condemnation of violations of international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">The Holy See equally welcomes the provisions of the Statute of the International Tribunal, as amended on 13 May 1998, in article 13, subparagraphs 2 (a) and (d), which acknowledge the Holy See's active participation in the establishment of the Tribunal, as a non-member State, maintaining a permanent observer mission at the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa04">However, the Holy See, in consideration of its specific nature and of its objectives as a sovereign international entity, and in accordance with recognized practice in similar cases, has decided to abstain from casting its vote on the individual candidates for the office of judge of the International Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa05">The Holy See expresses its confidence in the choices that will be made by the international community and its sincere best wishes for success to the elected judges in their service to the cause of justice. It is the hope of the Holy See that the persisting culture of impunity will soon be brought to an end and that all responsible for serious crimes in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, including those in Kosovo, will be brought promptly to justice.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa01">The Assembly will now proceed to another unrestricted ballot to fill the remaining vacancy.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa02">I should like to remind members that the representative of Chile announced earlier the withdrawal of his country's candidate, Mr. Húgo Aníbal Llanos Mansilla. Accordingly, the ballot papers to be distributed do not contain that name.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa03">Ballot papers are being distributed. All the candidates whose names appear on the ballot paper are eligible. Once again, I remind delegations that the name of only one candidate should be marked with a cross. Any ballot paper on which more than one name is marked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names appear on the ballot paper.</p>
