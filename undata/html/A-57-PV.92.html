	<div class="p">The General Assembly will proceed to the election of 18 ad litem judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, for a four-year term of office commencing on the day of the completion of this election.</div>
	<div class="p">(<i>spoke in English</i>)</div>
	<div class="p">By its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1431(2002)">resolution 1431 (2002)</a> of 14 August 2002, the Security Council decided to establish a pool of ad litem judges in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. To that end, it decided to amend articles 11, 12 and 13 of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p">In <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1431(2002)">resolution 1431 (2002)</a>, the Security Council further requested the Secretary-General to make practical arrangements for the election as soon as possible of 18 ad litem judges in accordance with article 12 ter of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal, as so amended.</div>
	<div class="p">The election of the 18 ad litem judges will take place in accordance with the relevant provisions of article 12 and article 12 ter of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended by the Security Council in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1431(2002)">resolution 1431 (2002)</a> of 14 August 2002.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with article 12 ter, paragraph 1 (d), of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended by the Security Council, the Holy See, being a non-member State that maintains a permanent observer mission at United Nations Headquarters, will participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. I am happy to welcome here the representative of the Holy See.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with subparagraph 1 (c) of article 12 ter of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Security Council, at its 4745th meeting on 23 April 2003, established a list of 35 candidates for transmittal to the General Assembly. The list, adopted by the Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1477(2003)">resolution 1477 (2003)</a> of 29 April 2003, was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by a letter dated 29 April 2003 from the President of the Security Council. The letter was issued as document <a href="../pdf/A-57-800">A/57/800</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Assembly to the other documents relating to the election.</div>
	<div class="p">The memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning the election of ad litem judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-801">A/57/801</a> and Addenda 1 to 5. The list of candidates can be found in paragraph 7 of document <a href="../pdf/A-57-801">A/57/801</a>. Information regarding the withdrawal of 12 candidates is contained in Addenda 1 to 5.</div>
	<div class="p">The curricula vitae of the candidates are contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-802">A/57/802</a>. In this connection, may I bring to the Assembly's attention article 12 of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended, which stipulates that ad litem judges of the Tribunal shall be persons of high moral character, impartiality and integrity who possess the qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial offices. According to the same provision, due account shall be taken in the overall composition of the Chambers and sections of the Trial Chambers of the Tribunal of the experience of the judges in criminal law, international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law.</div>
	<div class="p">Also in connection with this election, I would like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly the following:</div>
	<div class="p">Given the similar nature of the election of judges of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, it was decided at the time of the previous elections of judges in 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2003 to follow similar election procedures in the General Assembly. In his memorandum contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-57-801">A/57/801</a>, the Secretary-General suggests, in paragraph 8 (b), that these precedents be followed and that rule 151 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly be applied to the election of ad litem judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to that suggestion?</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="2-8">
	It was so decided.

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">In accordance with subparagraph 1 (d) of article 12 ter of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as amended, the candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the non-member State shall be declared elected.</div>
	<div class="p">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose, are all the 191 Member States, together with the non-member State, the Holy See. Accordingly, 97 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of the present election.</div>
	<div class="p">If, in the first ballot, the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than 18, a second ballot will be held and balloting will continue in the same meeting, if and as necessary, until 18 candidates have obtained an absolute majority. In any second or subsequent ballot, each elector may vote for no more than 18 candidates, less the number of candidates who have already obtained absolute majorities.</div>
	<div class="p">Following the practice in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, the Secretary-General suggests in his memorandum that any second or subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted. Votes may accordingly be cast in any second or subsequent ballot for any eligible candidate who has not yet obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p">It is further suggested that, following the practice in the election of the judges of the International Court of Justice, if more than 18 candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will be held on all candidates and balloting will continue at the same meeting, if and as necessary, until 18 candidates, and no more, have obtained an absolute majority.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the Assembly agrees to the procedures I have just outlined?</div>
