<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk04">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Koterec" nation="Slovakia" language="">
	Mr. Koterec (Slovakia)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa01">It gives me great pleasure to introduce to the General Assembly the reports of the First Committee on agenda items 62 to 83, contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-52-591.pdf">A/52/591</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-52-612.pdf">A/52/612</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa02">In response to the Assembly's appeal, the Committee concluded its work at the current session in 24 formal and six informal meetings, within existing resources. The work of the Committee throughout the present session could be characterized as having been constructive, more focused and action-oriented.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The First Committee had before it for consideration 43 draft resolutions, three draft decisions and a number of amendments to draft resolutions, and adopted 43 draft resolutions and two draft decisions, out of which 21, or 45 per cent, were adopted without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa04">The disarmament calendar for 1997 has been very intensive and eventful. During this year, Member States addressed issues which ranged across the full spectrum of security and disarmament items. In this regard, the entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, the establishment of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the establishment of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization and the signing on 3 and 4 December at Ottawa of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction are just a few examples which deserve to be mentioned.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa05">The First Committee's general debate on disarmament and international security items in fact reflected a propitious climate for future progress on a number of issues. The statements made by delegations revealed a readiness on the part of Member States to act with a high degree of cooperation in tackling those issues that they considered should be addressed in the nearest future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa06">As before, the complexity of nuclear issues in general, and non-proliferation in particular, continued to constitute the core of international security concerns during recent years. In that connection, nuclear-weapon-free zones, cut-off issues, nuclear non-proliferation and non-proliferation regimes of other weapons of mass destruction, as well as vehicles for their delivery, and conventional weapons were considered to be by far the most important concerns. This is reflected in the fact that out of the 45 resolutions and decisions adopted, 22 were devoted to those issues.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa07">The majority of delegations spoke of disarmament-related advances which have been achieved over the year. They focused on the efforts made in scaling down nuclear weapons at both the unilateral and bilateral levels. However, a number of delegations noted that the high expectations which prevailed following the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) had become somewhat subdued. Moreover, Member States expressed in particular their disappointment in the inability of the Conference on Disarmament to take up nuclear issues in 1997 and its impact on other subjects. Nevertheless, overwhelming hope was expressed that due process will be carried further in earnest and in time for a multilateral dimension.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa08">The Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the NPT not only reaffirmed the resolve of the international community to effectively prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, but also laid a solid foundation for the strengthening of non-proliferation regimes globally. In this respect, the Committee focused its attention on the problem of nuclear-weapon-free zones as a step towards achieving this goal. While the draft resolution on a Central Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone achieved the support of all Member States, the draft resolutions on a nuclear-weapon-free southern hemisphere and adjacent areas, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, the consolidation of the regime established by the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the African nuclear-weapon-free zone treaty, the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East have all continued to enjoy the wide support of delegations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa09">The Committee was unfortunately not able to adopt one combined resolution on nuclear disarmament. However, delegations duly noted the constructive and interested dialogue between the sponsors of two draft resolutions and called on them to double their efforts with a view to merging both drafts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa10">No less important to the Committee's work were the items concerning the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction. The entry into force on 29 April 1997 of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the ratification by the declared chemical weapon States have been hailed by the international community. A cooperative attitude displayed by the sponsors made it possible for the Committee to adopt, without a vote, one resolution on chemical weapons, which is a carefully crafted balance of interests of different Member States, reflecting a significant advance in this area.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa11">The Committee also welcomed the progress achieved by the Ad Hoc Group of Governmental Experts to Identify and Examine Potential Verification Measures from a Scientific and Technical Standpoint in pursuit of the mandate established by the Special Conference of the States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention in 1994, as part of the ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention. As during the General Assembly's fifty-first session, the resolution on this issue was adopted without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa12">While retaining traditional aspects, regional and conventional disarmament have attained a new dimension which requires urgent and decisive actions, with particular reference to the problem of landmines. Almost every delegation spoke passionately about the human suffering which is inflicted upon innocent civilians by these weapons. Delegations agreed on the necessity of urgent measures at all levels to solve this issue once and for all. In this connection, the Committee welcomed the successful conclusion of the Ottawa process. The fact that more than 100 countries participated in the work aimed at the complete banning of landmines bears witness to the growing humanitarian concern of the public at large, as well as to the importance attached to this issue by Governments and parliaments. The Committee took note of the statements made by those countries which, for some reason, are not in a position to sign the Ottawa convention. Although controversy remains on this issue, it came as no surprise that three resolutions on this subject enjoyed wide support in a balanced manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa13">Furthermore, the Committee adopted a resolution on the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. It is a positive development that the resolution was adopted by consensus. There was hope that through further consultations and intensive work within the framework of the Disarmament Commission next year, it will be possible to narrow the remaining differences and to achieve a consensus on the objectives and agenda of this issue.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa14">As in previous sessions, the issue of conventional weapons attracted considerable attention. The Committee had before it the report prepared by the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms. While commenting on the study and its recommendations, Member States agreed on the importance of continuing to address in various United Nations forums the problem of proliferation of small arms.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa15">The First Committee also considered the report, prepared by a group of governmental experts, on the issues of further improving and expanding the scope of the United Nations reporting instrument, the Register of Conventional Arms. Although it is generally recognized that the Register has already contributed to confidence-building, the divergence of views on specific measures for further development did not allow the group to introduce changes which some Member States were expecting. Despite this fact, Member States took note of the call for fuller participation and greater openness by all States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa16">At this session the First Committee again took up the issue of rationalization of its work. During two meetings, delegations exchanged their views on this item and a number of proposals were put forward. Unfortunately, no consensus could be reached on proposals for the rearrangement of agenda items and the number of meetings. Nevertheless, the Chairman has been entrusted with conducting further consultations in this regard and with reporting to the General Assembly at the beginning of its next session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa17">Finally, let me now briefly turn to the reports of the First Committee and draw the attention of delegations to a few changes in the text of the Rapporteur's reports in the following documents: in the Arabic, Russian and Spanish versions of document <a href="../pdf/A-52-600.pdf">A/52/600</a>, on agenda item 71, in part A of Section II, concerning draft resolution A/C.1/52/L.1, Niger should be deleted from the list of subsequent sponsors.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa18">Also, in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-612.pdf">A/52/612</a>, on agenda item 83, paragraph 7, after the words " d r a f t d e c i s i o n A/C.1/52/L.51/Rev.1", insert:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg001-bk04-pa19">"and stated that further consultations would be conducted by the Chairman, and he would report the outcome of the consultations to the General Assembly at the beginning of its next session".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa20">I would kindly ask delegations to make a note of these corrections.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa21">Before concluding, I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to all the delegations that participated in the work of the Committee for their spirit of cooperation in the common search for a better, safer and more stable world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa22">I should like to express special gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Mothusi Nkgowe who, with his intimate knowledge of disarmament and international security matters, as well as his excellent diplomatic skills, provided the Committee with vision and able leadership.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa23">Let me also thank the Committee's Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Sudjadnan Parnohadiningrat of Indonesia and Mr. Alejandro Guillermo Verdier of Argentina, who were most effective in discharging their duties.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa24">I should also like to express my appreciation to the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, Mr. Jin Yongjian, for the leadership he provided the Secretariat staff assisting the Committee, and to the Director of the Centre for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Prvoslav Davinic, for his valuable contribution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa25">Moreover, special thanks go to the Secretary of the First Committee, Mr. Lin Kuo-Chung, whose vast experience and high degree of competence made a significant contribution to the successful outcome of the Committee's work. I also express my gratitude to Mr. Mohammed Sattar, Mrs. Haiyan Qian, Ms. Cheryl Stoute, Mr. Timur Alasaniya and other officers of the Secretariat for their valuable assistance in the Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa26">With these brief remarks, I present the reports of the First Committee to the General Assembly for consideration, as contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-52-591.pdf">A/52/591</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-52-612.pdf">A/52/612</a>.</div>

However, we wish to stress that Chile will vote in favour of this draft resolution because it contains numerous positive elements with which we fully agree, including the references to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and, of course, the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.</div>

That support was illustrated, in particular, by Morocco's sponsorship of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-45.pdf">resolution 51/45</a> S on anti-personnel mines, adopted at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Morocco participated in the Oslo Conference and in the Ottawa Conference as an observer.

	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk06-pa01">Ukraine would like to explain its vote on draft resolution A, entitled "Convention on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk06-pa02">We support the aspirations of the Ottawa process to overcome the humanitarian crisis arising from the large-scale, indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines. We welcome the overwhelming success represented by last week's signing by 121 States of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. The goal of achieving an effective and legally binding international agreement to ban anti-personnel mines is within the main guidelines of my country's foreign policy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk06-pa03">As its contribution to the international efforts in this field, Ukraine has been strictly abiding by the 1995 international moratorium on the export of anti-personnel mines and is determined to prolong it. In addition, Ukraine has acceded to and is planning to ratify Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), as amended in May 1996.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk06-pa04">Today Ukraine is ready to start partial destruction of its stockpiles of anti-personnel mines. However, our country, which faces serious financial and economic difficulties, cannot cope alone with this monstrous legacy of the former Soviet Union. That is why we believe that to sign the Convention and not be able to implement its provisions in full and in a timely manner because of a lack of resources would contradict the main tenets of our foreign policy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk06-pa05">Ukraine would therefore welcome any assistance from the States parties, in accordance with article 6 of the Convention. When the Convention enters into force, Ukraine will be ready to consider the possibility of starting to report to the depositary of the Convention on its stockpiled anti-personnel mines, in accordance with the transparency measures envisaged in article 7 of the Convention.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk06-pa06">Ukraine fully supports the noble spirit of the Convention. We hope that in the foreseeable future, our country will be in a position to sign this important document. With this in mind, my delegation did not hesitate to vote in favour of draft resolution A.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk07-pa02">During the fiftieth session, in the First Committee, Argentina was a sponsor of draft resolution A/C.1/50/L.58/Rev.1, introduced by Japan on this same item, but was unable to support the fifth preambular paragraph of that text, because we felt that to some extent it ran counter to the aim of limiting the circulation of small arms. In fact, we consider that apart from self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter there should be no exceptions to the limitation of the circulation of these weapons. In the vote on that paragraph, which was similar to the fifth preambular paragraph of draft resolution J, on which the Assembly has just taken action, there were 88 abstentions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk07-pa03">It was for those same reasons that the Argentine Republic abstained today in the vote on the fifth preambular paragraph of draft resolution J. That abstention should not be interpreted as opposition to the principle of the self-determination of peoples, which my country has always supported in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I would like to refer to draft resolution A in document <a href="../pdf/A-52-600.pdf">A/52/600</a>, entitled "Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction". As a result of serious consideration of our position and as proof of the constructive nature of our approach to this subject, Belarus has modified its initial position of abstention in respect of that draft resolution, and has just voted in favour of it. As a sign of goodwill and of adherence by Belarus to the humanitarian objectives of the anti-personnel mines Convention, President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, in view of the forthcoming expiration of the previous moratorium, signed on 2 September 1997 a decree prolonging until the end of 1999 the national moratorium on the export of this type of weapon. Belarus does not intend to manufacture anti-personnel mines; nor does it use landmines for the protection of its borders or for any other purpose.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg024-bk01-pa02">It also gives me special pleasure to inform the General Assembly that the Parliament of Belarus has ratified the amended Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects. The instrument of ratification will shortly be deposited with the Secretary-General.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg024-bk01-pa03">Measures taken at the national level testify that the Republic of Belarus will never be a source of mine proliferation. Belarus shares the aims of the Convention: to stop human suffering and to protect civilians from the twentieth-century plague of mines. The people of Belarus have gone through the sufferings wrought by these weapons during two world wars. The mines and other munitions left on our territory in a treacherous legacy continue to mutilate the civilian population today, in spite of intensive demining efforts undertaken nationally on a permanent basis.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg024-bk01-pa04">Yet I have to underscore that close analysis of the Convention's provisions and of the international obligations arising out of them shows that Belarus would need tens of millions of dollars to destroy its stockpiles of anti-personnel mines. The hard truth is that at a time when we are living through economic reforms, with 25 per cent of the national budget channelled annually to mitigating the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, economic and financial considerations do not allow the Republic of Belarus -- which is aware of the binding obligations stipulated by the Convention -- to put its signature on that document today.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg024-bk01-pa05">Belarus expects that its position -- the reasoning behind which is compelling -- will not be misinterpreted, because we consider that signing an international document is a responsible step. We also have to take into consideration our experience in the destruction of conventional weapons under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, when Belarus, bound by its international commitments and despite all the complexities of its economic situation, had to eliminate by its own means a disproportionate quantity of weapons, amounting to 10 per cent of all European arsenals earmarked for destruction. Our appeals for international financial assistance went without response, although for a number of years we had proposed the establishment of an international fund to assist countries faced with a similar disproportionate burden on their economies as a result of complying with their commitments. For this reason, the economic aspect of our international obligations is crucial for us.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg024-bk01-pa06">In view of what I have said, the Republic of Belarus welcomes the fact that the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons foresees mechanisms for international cooperation and financial and technical assistance for the clearance and destruction of stockpiles of anti-personnel mines. We believe that, should those mechanisms prove to be effective, the Convention would soon be signed by those nations which entirely share its humanitarian objectives but which, owing to a number of objective reasons, are in no position to sign it now. Then, among those signatures would be that of Belarus.</div>
