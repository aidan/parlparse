	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council recalls and reaffirms its presidential statement of 16 November 2006 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-45.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/45</a>) on talks between the Government of the Republic of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council stresses its support for a negotiated settlement, commends the Government of southern Sudan and others for their efforts to further a long-term and peaceful solution to the conflict, reiterates that those responsible for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law must be brought to justice and urges that the peace process be concluded expeditiously.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council urges the LRA to immediately release all women, children and other non-combatants, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1612(2005).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1612 (2005)</a> on children and armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the appointment of, and the efforts undertaken so far by, His Excellency Mr. Joaquim Chissano, former President of Mozambique, as the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the LRA-affected areas, as set out in the Secretary-General's letter of 30 November 2006 to the President of the Security Council (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-930.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/930</a>), welcomes his briefing to the Security Council on 22 March 2007 and looks forward to his continued engagement on the issue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the meeting between the Government of Uganda and the LRA on 11 March 2007, with community representatives present, and the progress made towards a resumption of talks. The Security Council looks forward to further progress in the talks and the renewal of the cessation of hostilities agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council commends the support provided to the talks by States in the region, welcomes contributions to the United Nations Juba Initiative Project and urges the United Nations Secretariat and the countries and regional actors involved to provide further support, where possible, to Special Envoy Chissano and the mediation team.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council notes the improved security and humanitarian situation in northern Uganda but looks forward to further progress on improving the living conditions for civilians there and urges the international community and the Government of Uganda to sustain and improve humanitarian and development support, including through Uganda's Emergency Action Plan as overseen by the Joint Monitoring Committee."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-6.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/6</a>.</p>
