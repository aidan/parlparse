<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01"> The Security Council will now proceed to the consideration of its annual report to the General Assembly, the draft of which has been prepared by the Secretariat. Members of the Council have before them the draft report of the Security Council to the General Assembly for the period from 16 June 1999 to 15 June 2000, as circulated by the Officer-in-Charge of the Department of Political Affairs on 21 August 2000, and a corrigendum thereto.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">I should like to express appreciation to the Secretariat for the work it has undertaken in preparing this factual report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I shall now call on the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs to make an explanatory statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fall</span> <span class="non-nation">Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">The draft report before the Council has been prepared and presented both in conformity with Articles 15 and 24 of the United Nations Charter and in line with the revised format agreed upon by the Security Council in 1974 and further revised in 1985, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">The draft report presents the activities of the Council in a concise manner. It should be noted that, in addition to the extensive coverage provided in part V on the work of the subsidiary organs of the Council, the annual reports of the sanctions Committees are to be found in appendix XII of the report, in accordance with the note by the President of the Security Council of 30 October 1998. Further, pursuant to the understanding reached in the Council's consultations of the whole on 30 November 1998, the statements to the press made by the President following consultations of the whole of the Council have also been included in an annex.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">Finally, as the President has pointed out, the draft report before the Council was distributed by the Department of Political Affairs on 21 August 2000. Subsequently, the Secretariat took note of a number of proposed changes, which have been transmitted to the members of the Council as a corrigendum.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">That concludes my very brief introduction of the draft report to the Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk07">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01"> May I take it that the draft report, as corrected, is adopted by the Council?</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">This decision will be reflected in a note by the President of the Security Council, to be issued as <a href="../pdf/S-2000-839.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/839</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">The Security Council has thus concluded its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
