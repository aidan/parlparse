	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Albania, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Belarus, Canada, Colombia, Croatia, Cuba, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Greece, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Myanmar, Peru, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and Yemen, in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations and in the absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to His Excellency Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I invite Sir Jeremy Greenstock to take a seat at the Council table.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2003-191.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2003/191</a>, which contains the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">In view of the long list of speakers before us, I would kindly request all speakers to limit their statements to no more than seven minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. We have 27 speakers on the list. So, every minute that participants add to their seven minutes of speaking time adds half an hour to the deliberations of the Council. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate their text in writing and to deliver the condensed versions in the Chamber.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">In another measure to optimize the use of our time in order to allow as many delegations to take the floor as possible, I will not individually invite speakers to take seats at the table or invite them to resume their seats at the side of the Chamber. When a speaker is taking the floor, the Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the list at the table. I think that that is a procedure that served us well yesterday, and we would like to continue this procedure, if the Council agrees.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">I thank representatives for their understanding and their cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">I shall first give the floor to the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council, Sir Jeremy Greenstock.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Mr. President, I very much appreciate the time that you have allocated for this important subject today to hear the views of Members of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">On 20 January, we heard the views of our ministers on the Security Council's work on counter-terrorism, including the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). I welcome the support that they expressed for the work of the CTC and their commitment to achieving the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and to further developing the CTC's role.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The CTC has discussed the challenge which ministers set for us all in the declaration adopted by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>. We have agreed on a set of actions for the CTC to take forward the points in the declaration. This set of actions is being circulated to delegations with my speaking notes. The CTC will keep the Council and the wider membership fully informed of progress.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The Committee continues to work with the vigour, focus and transparency which the fight against terrorism demands. Our expert team is back up to strength and is continually gaining in experience and effectiveness. In the current period, as our published work programme shows, we are concentrating on three areas: first, working with Member States to raise their capacity to defeat terrorism in each of their countries; secondly, promoting assistance programmes to accelerate the capacity-building process; and thirdly, creating a global network of international and regional organizations to maximize the efficiency of each of them in dealing with terrorism and to share experience and best practice. The special meeting of the CTC which I have called for 7 March will help in taking forward this global effort.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the CTC will continue to encourage States to become party as soon as possible to the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, as the matter of urgency demanded by the ministerial declaration. The CTC will remain aware of the links between its work and Member States' obligations under international law, including international human rights and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The CTC welcomes this opportunity to hear the views of Member States on the work of the United Nations in the field of counter-terrorism. I thank them for their engagement with the CTC in its work so far. The Committee will continue to be effective only if it has the confidence and support of the United Nations membership, and it would be most helpful to hear their views on the way ahead, as set out for the Council in my report on behalf of the CTC on 20 January, and in the ministerial declaration.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">I should like to request speakers not to address kind words to the presidency. Let us use our valuable time only on the subject.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Japan, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haraguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting to follow up the ministerial-level meeting held on 20 January on combating international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">In a democracy, people express their views freely, and differences of views are resolved peacefully through the ballot. Terrorists, on the other hand, seek to realize their objectives violently, through bullets. Terrorists try to justify themselves by insisting that they are denied democratic means and have no other recourse but terror to realize their goals. But acts of terrorism cannot be justified under any circumstances. All too often, it is the innocent who are the victims of terrorist acts. Such acts must be strongly rejected and condemned.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">But simple condemnation is not sufficient to protect democratic systems and ensure security. Efforts must be urgently made in order to implement ongoing counter-terrorism measures even more effectively. At the same time, I would like to add that it is also important to make honest efforts to analyse the root causes of terrorism and to try to redress them.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">In the past, terrorist activities generally targeted certain regions, but, with the spread of globalization and with advances in science and technology, terrorists now have a more global reach, with greater destructive and lethal capacities, as we witnessed in the 11 September attacks and in the bombing incident in Bali. The situation would become even more dangerous if terrorists were to have access to weapons of mass destruction. Traditional means of deterrence cannot adequately address the threat of international terrorism. International terrorism is thus a new and grave threat to international peace and security in the twenty-first century and demands resolute and concerted action by the international community. The existing global cooperative mechanism and international rules must be strengthened.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">In the global fight against terrorism, Japan considers the following three objectives to be of particular importance: first, denying terrorist groups safe haven; secondly, denying terrorist groups the means to conduct terrorism; and thirdly, eliminating vulnerability to terrorism. In order to achieve these objectives, cooperative relations and networks among countries must be built in a wide range of areas, including not only military organizations but also law-enforcement agencies and intelligence organizations. Capacity-building efforts in developing countries to strengthen their counter-terrorism measures are also vital.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">We appreciate very much the work done by the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) to that end. Japan, for its part, attaches particular importance to such efforts in the Asian region and has been holding seminars and training courses for developing countries, mainly in Asia, in the following six areas: immigration, aviation security, customs cooperation, export control, law-enforcement cooperation and anti-terrorist financing. It received 220 officials in fiscal year 2001, and approximately 250 in fiscal year 2002, for training in these six areas. In addition, my country is planning to receive 30 trainees each year for the next five years, for a total of 150 trainees, with a view to enhancing the crisis- and consequence-management capacity of their respective countries in the event of a chemical, biological, radioactive or nuclear terrorist attack. Japan is also planning to hold a seminar to encourage accession to counter-terrorism-related international conventions, to which it will invite officials from Asian countries.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">Every member of the international community must actively take part in the global combat against terrorism. We have to mobilize the resources available, including the expertise of all relevant international, regional and subregional organizations. From this viewpoint, Japan strongly endorses the sixth work programme of the CTC and its intention to expand and deepen its contacts with these organizations. It goes without saying that global efforts must be well coordinated to avoid any duplication of work. We believe that the dialogue between the CTC and these organizations, which has already begun, will greatly contribute to such coordination.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">The special meeting with representatives of international, regional and subregional organizations, to be held next month, will be an important occasion for both the CTC and other relevant international organizations to assess their respective contributions to combat terrorism and explore ways of improving coordination.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">In its 17 months of work, the CTC has made remarkable progress in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. For that, I would like to reiterate our appreciation to Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the CTC, and other members of the Bureau. But the fight against terrorism, especially international terrorism, is by no means complete. Much more needs to be done. I trust that, under the new leadership of Ambassador Inocencio Arias, the Committee will continue its highly effective efforts to combat terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I call now on the representative of Belarus.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ivanou</span> <span class="nation">Belarus</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">In the year following the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, one of the major achievements of the international campaign to combat terrorism launched after 11 September 2001, important results were achieved in strengthening the anti-terrorism potential of the United Nations and in the establishment, under its auspices, of a broad international coalition to counteract terrorism as a serious threat to peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">Belarus is firmly committed to a policy of expanding international cooperation to combat international terrorism and to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It considers itself an integral part of the international anti-terrorism coalition. We value highly the efforts of the Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), which is charged with overseeing the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The CTC has become a key link in the United Nations anti-terrorism system and has received needed support from national and regional institutions involved in the struggle against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Belarus has submitted two timely reports for consideration by the CTC on progress in its implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It has also submitted the questionnaire on the provision of technical assistance to ensure more effective border control to combat terrorism, illegal migration and related criminal activity. Work is now under way on the next report on the implementation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The dual political position of Belarus, which is a kind of corridor between Europe and the States members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), makes it particularly important to ensure tight border and customs controls to prevent the illegal transportation of weapons and munitions and to halt illegal migration, drug trade and other actions linked to terrorist activity. Those measures require significant material and financial resources.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Belarus has done much to improve border and customs controls within the context of combating terrorism and related criminal activity. Nevertheless, to resolve that problem our State is counting on the future assistance of the CTC, international organizations and donor countries. In our view, the Security Council meeting held at the ministerial level on issues related to combating international terrorism, which took place on 20 January 2003, was very significant in terms of determining the future strategy for the activities of the CTC and of the Security Council as a whole. We support the provisions of the declaration annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>, and we are ready to contribute to the attainment of its objectives. Moreover, we hope that, in the light of the approach set down in the declaration, the process of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> will continue to be as open as possible and will encourage a constructive dialogue between the CTC and States regarding measures needed to help States to fully carry out their obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Continuing and giving fresh impetus to the present dynamic of cooperation between the CTC and Member States within the framework of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> will be impossible without the further consolidation of an atmosphere of mutual trust regarding issues related to combating international terrorism and respect for the positions of all members of the international community on anti-terrorist activity. Only thus will it be possible to foresee a successful campaign against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Belarus welcomes the intention of the CTC to hold a special meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations on 7 March 2003 at the United Nations. The CTC initiative to merge the efforts of international, regional and subregional organizations to combat international terrorism will undoubtedly promote closer coordination of action among those organizations regarding the problem and will have a positive impact on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Regarding the CIS, Belarus, together with other States, is taking measures to strengthen the potential of the CIS Anti-Terrorism Centre and is considering ways to involve that international body in the process of promoting implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> at the regional level, as a promising area for its future work.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">In conclusion, we wish to note that the practice of holding open Security Council meetings at which all Member States have the opportunity to state their positions on the Council's anti-terrorism efforts is a valuable way to assess the effects of measures undertaken to overcome this global problem of our time -- namely, international terrorism -- which is currently having a significant impact on international security policy. We hope that that practice will be continued and that it will make it possible in the near future to achieve a greater degree of unity among the participants of the campaign to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and to avoid the use of double standards in the approaches taken by members of the anti-terrorism coalition.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I call now on the representative of Australia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dauth</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">Australia welcomes this opportunity to again address the Security Council on an issue of fundamental importance to the international community. As members know, on 12 October 2002 a terrorist attack on the Indonesian island of Bali took the lives of more than 200 innocent civilians from some 21 countries; 88 Australians were killed in that brutal attack, which, together with the attacks in Mombasa, Moscow and Bogota, demonstrated all too clearly terrorism's global reach and the threat it poses to peace and security. Those heinous attacks have only strengthened the Australian Government's resolve to protect Australian citizens and to confront the threat posed by international terrorism in our region and internationally. That was underlined, I should say, in our recently released foreign policy white paper. If anyone is short of bedtime reading, I will be happy to share a copy with him or her.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Australia's approach to combating terrorism is comprehensive, covering bilateral, regional and multilateral activities, as well as political, economic, diplomatic, legal and, where appropriate, military initiatives. Bilaterally, we have concluded formal counter-terrorism arrangements with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. We are close to finalizing similar arrangements with other friends in our region, including the Philippines and Fiji. Those arrangements promote stronger cooperation in the fight against terrorism in key areas such as intelligence exchange, law enforcement, anti-terrorist financing and border controls. The excellent cooperation between Australian and Indonesian police in investigating the Bali bombings has been facilitated by our arrangements with Indonesia, which have also served as a foundation for counter-terrorism capacity-building activities.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">At a regional level, Australia has been active in supporting counter-terrorism initiatives and programmes. Australia is strengthening its own and the Asia-Pacific region's defences against terrorism, working with our Asian and Pacific-island neighbours, and also with the United States and the United Kingdom and others. In cooperation with New Zealand and the United States, we are assisting Pacific island countries to implement their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In December, Australia and Indonesia co-hosted a regional conference on combating money-laundering and terrorist financing in Bali. The conference raised awareness of the problem of terrorist financing and encouraged action to cut off funding of terrorist groups. Within the Regional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), planning is well advanced for a workshop that Australia will be co-hosting with Singapore on managing the consequences of a terrorist attack. In the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) association, we are exploring options to help countries in the region implement their commitments under APEC's Secure Trade in the APEC Region initiative, which will help secure the flow of goods and people.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">Globally, the United Nations must continue to play a key role in denying terrorists the opportunity to commit their appalling crimes. That is especially the case in relation to efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There is no greater danger for the international community than that of weapons of mass destruction finding their way into the hands of terrorists, who, with such weapons, would have the capacity to kill tens or hundreds of thousands of innocent people.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">Against that background, we welcome and endorse the ministerial declaration on terrorism annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>, which highlighted the importance of tight controls over the use of and access to nuclear, chemical, biological and other deadly materials. The declaration also emphasized the need for full compliance with existing legal obligations in the field of disarmament, arms limitation and non-proliferation. In that context, we would recall that, as we stated in the Council on Tuesday, 18 February, Australia considers that this body should act decisively and resolutely to deal with Iraq's disarmament.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">Australia remains a strong proponent of the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism. We have made substantial efforts to achieve consensus on the convention, leading informal negotiations to resolve outstanding issues in relation to its scope. We welcome the encouragement in the ministerial declaration for the conclusion of the convention.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">It would be entirely remiss of me not to mention the valuable work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) under the really quite exemplary, transparent and consultative leadership of Ambassador Greenstock, who in this area has demonstrated the great skill in this area that he brings to all the work that he does at the United Nations. In that context, I am pleased also to note that he is to be succeeded by another extremely able colleague of ours, the Permanent Representative of Spain. The CTC has played, and continues to play, a crucial role in global efforts to fight terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">We also commend the excellent work of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, whose consolidated list is a key counter-terrorism tool. We encourage more proactive listing of terrorists and terrorist entities under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. Australia welcomes the steps being taken by the CTC and the 1267 sanctions Committee to better coordinate their activities and to improve the exchange of information.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">Australia is acutely aware that winning the fight against terrorism will take long-term commitment. For its part, Australia will continue to shoulder its counter-terrorism responsibilities and can be counted on to support the efforts of the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">Memories of the recent wave of worldwide terrorist attacks make us painfully aware of how vulnerable all our societies are when faced with the threat of international terrorism. The continuing high terror alert, which is becoming a daily reality for many of us, reminds us that this new global scourge, which is indiscriminate in its attacks, does not recognize borders, nationalities, religion, race or age.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">Although anti-terrorism is not a new item on the United Nations agenda, it took the horrors of 11 September 2001 to galvanize the international community and to step up the global fight against terrorism. Those acts, which shook the foundations of the world order, have redefined our understanding of the notion of a threat to international peace and security. The Security Council responded to that threat appropriately and promptly by adopting <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and by subsequently creating the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). The almost universal response of Member States to the CTC's requests is a telling example of how efficient the United Nations can be in mobilizing the international community in this fight.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">We believe that the CTC's work thus far has been a success. By prompting Member States to consolidate and improve their legislative and law-enforcement measures and to identify possible weak spots in countering terrorism at the national level, the CTC reporting system has proved to be more than purely a stock-taking exercise. I would like to use this opportunity to express my Government's thanks and appreciation to the Committee's Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for his dedication, efficiency and transparency in guiding the work of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">This meeting comes at an opportune time for discussing how to enhance and intensify the Committee's work. As last month's ministerial meeting indicated, the CTC is ready to enter a new phase, which should be more action-oriented. We were particularly encouraged by proposals aimed at the establishment of a special cooperation and assistance fund, under United Nations auspices, that would cooperate closely with international financial institutions. For many countries, including mine, the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> could be significantly upgraded through technical and financial assistance. For its part, Croatia has already elaborated several projects that could benefit from such assistance -- ranging from enhancing border controls to the training of law enforcement and anti-terrorist experts to protection against attacks involving radiation and weapons of mass destruction -- as described in its earlier submissions to the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">The United Nations has proved to be indispensable at the global level as a focal point for integrated action and as the architect of an extensive body of international anti-terrorist legislation. The universal criminalization of terrorist-related acts is the first step towards their eradication. However, relevant international instruments have no value without universal participation and full implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">In addition to a number of regional and sectoral agreements, Croatia is party to six key United Nations conventions on suppressing terrorism and is taking steps to expeditiously become party to the remaining legal instruments. In view of next month's meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/210</a> of 17 December 1996, charged with the elaboration of a draft comprehensive convention on combating international terrorism and a draft convention on the suppression of nuclear terrorism, my delegation hopes that Member States will find the critical political will to finalize these negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">Regional and subregional cooperation complements and enhances our global efforts. We therefore welcome the forthcoming meeting between the CTC and representatives of the relevant international and regional organizations, hoping that it will deepen that synergy.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">Croatia plays an active part in various regional counter-terrorism initiatives. As a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Croatia has implemented obligations set out in the Bucharest Plan of Action for Combating Terrorism as well as those stipulated by five anti-terrorism conventions of the Council of Europe. The Plan of Action for Combating Terrorism, adopted at the Warsaw Conference of the Presidents of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, has initiated further measures aimed at strengthening cooperation within the region.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">Within that framework, in September 2002 Croatia hosted an international symposium on "Terrorism and security in the twenty-first century: South-Eastern Europe and the world". A number of additional projects are being realized within the framework of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, the Central European Initiative, the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative, the Budapest process and the South-Eastern European Cooperation Initiative Regional Centre for Combating Transborder Crime, or in direct collaboration with neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">At the bilateral level, Croatia has concluded agreements on cooperation in the fight against terrorism, organized crime and drug abuse with 18 countries, while 32 additional agreements are under way. By focusing on controlling migration and borders, harmonizing legislation, sharing information and fighting organized crime and money-laundering, those initiatives are important in preventing and eliminating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">Ultimately, it is implementation at the national level that remains crucial for eradicating terrorism. Following the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the Croatian Government established an inter-agency working group charged specifically with its implementation and mandated all relevant governmental agencies to examine the implementing legislation and to initiate possible amendments. Subsequently, the criminal code was amended in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, while the law on foreign currency transactions, the anti-money-laundering law, the law on legal assistance and the asylum law are currently being revised. The ratification of several anti-terrorism treaties is under way. Croatia has also implemented 98 per cent of the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, which have been incorporated into national legislation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">The fight against international terrorism is multilevel and multifaceted and has many fronts, which were addressed in the declaration that the Council adopted on 20 January as an annex to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>. We find it encouraging that development issues and conflict prevention have been integrated into the Council's campaign against terrorism. The interdependence of socio-economic, security and peace-building issues was itself the focus of the Croatian presidency of the Economic and Social Council in 2002. The need for a holistic approach calls, in turn, for tight cooperation between the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. We believe that collaboration between those two bodies should be given due consideration in our efforts to eradicate international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa13">Success in combating international terrorism ultimately depends on the ability of our Governments to work together through international cooperation mechanisms. By virtue of its worldwide membership, the United Nations provides a unique institutional framework to do this. We therefore welcome the sustained comprehensive approach outlined in the ministerial declaration and consider it our common responsibility to cooperate fully with the Council in this fight.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Israel, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gillerman</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">At the outset, please allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency for the month of February. I would also like to congratulate your predecessor, the Ambassador of France, for his handling of that very difficult position.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">I must tell the Council that I find it very symbolic that my first statement to the Council should be on an issue that has particular resonance for the people and Government of Israel. Since the very moment of its establishment, Israel has been the target of terrorism, perpetrated with the support and sponsorship of extremist elements and regimes operating in various countries in our region. Even after 54 years of independence, the threat of terrorism has hardly abated. On the contrary, terrorism continues to be a daily fact of life for Israelis. The Palestinian campaign of terror persists. It has so far included literally hundreds of attacks and suicide bombings, including the Passover massacre in Netanya and the bombings of a discotheque in Tel Aviv, public buses and shopping centres.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Let me be personal for just one moment and tell the Council about my little grandchild, Ron, who is four years old and attends a kindergarten in the heart of Tel Aviv. Being a very devoted and crazy grandfather, I sometimes chuck everything aside and go to pick him up. Every time I do that, my heart breaks at the sight of the armed guard who stands outside my innocent little four-year-old grandchild's school to protect him and his fellow children. Israel is the only democracy in the world whose kindergartens, schools, universities, cafes and restaurants have to be protected by armed guards. I take the liberty to say that I am probably the only Ambassador in this room today who confronts an armed guard when he goes to pick up his little grandchild from kindergarten.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">For countries blessed to have terrorism remain an abstraction, my country today offers a glimpse into what might be in store if terrorism is not confronted resolutely, with a united front and without fear. In the face of all this, the people of Israel have demonstrated their strength and their resilience by continuing to live their lives and by refusing to succumb to fear. Our real heroes are the bus drivers, students, shoppers and commuters who, while taking all necessary precautions, continue to lead full and vibrant lives.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">It is as a result, unfortunately, of Israel's long experience confronting terrorism that we consider ourselves a natural partner in the intensified campaign to rid the world of the scourge of terrorism undertaken by this Council in the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001. In this connection, I am pleased to inform the Council that the Israeli Government has recently ratified two important anti-terrorism treaties: the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings of 1997 and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism of 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">Israel supports the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), and I would like to commend Ambassador Greenstock for the wonderful and very devoted work he is doing. We believe that intensive international cooperation is a critical weapon in the counter-terrorist arsenal. Israel stands ready and willing to share its knowledge and expertise -- and is already doing so with many countries in the world -- and to collaborate in joint efforts aimed at coordinating and strengthening our collective response.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">At the same time, we would like to see the CTC take a more proactive role beyond the technical work of collecting and analysing country reports. We would like to see the CTC organize discussions on particular issues related to the counter-terrorism effort, including aviation security and the threat of non-conventional weapons. We would further like to see more transparency in the work of the CTC. We believe that more comprehensive information should be made available to the international community to ensure that every Member State has the ability to make a contribution.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">We must battle terrorism on all fronts. This means more than using the full range of economic, military, legal and diplomatic tools at our disposal. It also means making no distinctions between so-called bad terrorism and good terrorism. Terror is terror is terror. Despite the seeming universality of this fight, there remain those who persist in drawing distinctions between varieties of violence deliberately targeted against civilians. The international community must stand firmly by the principle that the use of violence against civilians for political means is completely and utterly unacceptable, regardless of cause or motive.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">This position was made explicit once again last month when the Security Council, meeting at the level of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, affirmed in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a> that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg008-bk02-pa10">"any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, whenever and by whomsoever committed and are to be unequivocally condemned". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1456 (2003)</a>, annex</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">Israel believes that such a declaration and a matching commitment to action are essential to our fight against terrorism. Concessions in the face of terrorism anywhere are an invitation to terror everywhere.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa12">We can never allow the apologists for terrorism to invoke the mantra of root causes to justify murder while laying the moral foundation for future attacks. Terrorism is not the product of poverty or despair, as certain representatives, cynically motivated by their own narrow political interests, would like us to believe. To draw on an example from close to home, Palestinian prosperity and political aspirations have only ever been advanced through negotiations and the rejection of terrorism and violence. The resort to terrorism is what has brought despair. Let me make this very, very clear: It is not poverty that breeds terror; it is terror that breeds poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa13">If the battle against terror is to succeed, groups that use it cannot be allowed to reap political gains and be honoured with central roles on the world stage. Those who kill themselves in order to kill others are murderers, not martyrs, and we cannot permit their crimes to be sanitized with such terms as "martyrdom" and "resistance". Terrorism should harm the political ambitions of those who engage in it, not invite appeasement and concessions from those too frightened to confront it. Political advances won through terrorism are the surest guarantee of more terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa14">I therefore call on the Security Council to implement a policy of zero tolerance for terrorism. The time has come to stop talking and to start acting. Terrorism is evil and evil cannot be appeased, it cannot be assuaged; it must be fought and defeated.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa15">The fight against terrorism must begin at home. Our efforts will be successful only if every single State undertakes a sincere and irrevocable commitment to eradicating terrorism from its soil. In the past 18 months, Israel has updated and improved its already expansive body of domestic legislation, counter-terrorist measures and cooperative partnerships.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa16">If the events of 11 September have taught us anything, it is that even one State continuing to support and provide safe harbour to terrorists constitutes a threat of unimaginable proportions. It is therefore essential that all States make ironclad commitments that are manifest in real practical measures, including intense cooperation with the international community and the Counter-Terrorism Committee. The problem in this area may be less with those States that lack the capacity to fight terrorism than with those rogue regimes that lack the will to do so, or worse, actively use and support terrorism to further their subversive agenda. Of highest concern are those rogue regimes with biological, chemical and nuclear weapons that can be transferred to terrorists who have no compunctions regarding their use.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa17">In this connection, we note the irony of the remarks made on Friday in this Council by the Foreign Minister of Syria, the representative of a State that is among the world's foremost sponsors of terrorism. The Syrian delegation rarely foregoes an opportunity to launch one of its ritual diatribes against Israel, regardless of the issue on the Council's agenda. I need hardly point out the appalling contradiction between Syria's membership on this Council and its continued, extensive and unapologetic support for no fewer than 10 separate terrorist organizations. In flagrant violation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and basic norms of international law, the Government of Syria continues to provide financial and logistical support and safe harbour to known terrorist groups that operate freely and openly in Syrian-controlled territory.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa18">The international community must not allow Syria to abuse its position on the Council, as it has done repeatedly, to divert attention from its failure to comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Of what use is the campaign against terrorism if others see that States that manifestly fail to live up to their obligations escape condemnation and are even elevated to positions of prominence at the United Nations?</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa19">As the body charged with monitoring the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the CTC can make a vital contribution to our efforts, provided that it is focused and substantive and is prepared, in addition to its other activities, to identify and exert pressure on those States that are failing to fulfil their responsibilities. The CTC must have the courage to name and shame those States that continue to support terrorism even as the world unites to confront it. Yes, the time has come to name them and shame them.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa20">We also must acknowledge the role of incitement in encouraging and legitimizing acts of terrorism. No child, anywhere, is born wanting to be a suicide terrorist, and in our region we are faced with constant reminders of how these children and these suicide bombers are created. The mass media, educational institutions and religious and political figures of the Palestinian Authority inculcate and glorify hatred and offer the moral sanction of both man and God for acts of mass murder. Terrorists must hear not just from this Council, but also from their own people, from their own societies and from their own spiritual and political leaders that the indiscriminate murder of innocents is always wrong and unjustifiable.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa21">We must confront the poisonous well of incitement from which future terrorists are nourished and sustained. Resolutions adopted by the Council in the future should clearly refer to the role of incitement in glorifying and promoting terrorism. We further hope that the CTC will place the fight against incitement at the forefront of its efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa22">Finally, the fight against terrorism is not for the faint of heart. We cannot afford to tire or grow complacent. Those seeking to murder innocent civilians, precisely because they are innocent, and to give up their own lives in the process, are not easily deterred or dissuaded. We are locked in a battle of endurance, one that requires sustained political will to see it through to its conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa23">The world is now engaged in a harsh battle against the forces of terrorism. We face a difficult road ahead, but great struggles have always yielded great rewards. The defeat of terrorism will be the defeat of those who wish to turn history backwards, to stop the march of human progress. Defeating terrorism will throw open the door to a bold new future and to an era of peace and prosperity, not only in the Middle East but also around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa24">Even in these dark days, the people of Israel have never lost their hope and their desire for peace. Even with the threat of terrorism a constant and pervasive presence, we continue to believe that the day will come when children like my grandchild Ron will no longer need armed guards to protect them at school. It is precisely the belief that a peaceful future must ultimately arrive that gives us the strength to endure.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa25">The day will yet arrive when discussions like these will seem anachronistic, a relic of a past that has been supplanted by a peaceful present and a limitless future. It is my belief that with proper leadership and sufficient resolve that day may not be far off.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Cuba, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">In order to save time I will read a condensed version, and I wish to place on record the full version of my statement.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">The series of terrorist attacks in the most diverse parts of the world that followed the criminal acts of 11 September, the State terrorism against the Palestinian people and the spiral of violence that this generates, and the terrorism against Cuba, inter alia, demonstrate that a comprehensive and collective solution can be found to this ancient and terrible scourge only through harmonious cooperation and consensus, and not by means of war.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">Hegemonic unilateralism and double standards have prevented the United Nations from recovering its prerogatives and discharging its peace functions. Unilateral acts or pre-emptive war by a State or a group of States however powerful they may be, on the pretext of combating terrorism are totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">For several decades Cuba has struggled in an exemplary fashion and taken effective measures against international terrorism. It has never carried out, financed, tolerated or permitted a terrorist act, not even in legitimate defence against the direct perpetrators or the masterminds of heinous crimes committed against our people. It has never allowed its territory to be used for terrorist acts against any State, without exception, and it has declared that it will do everything in its power to prevent this in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">I categorically reject the slander by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director, Mr. Robert Mueller, before the Senate Intelligence Committee on 11 February 2003, which sought to present Cuba as a threat to the United States, and I challenge him to present the slightest evidence in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">On the contrary, on 29 November 2001 Cuba proposed to the United States Government, without any condition and in keeping with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of 28 September 2001, three draft bilateral agreements. The first is a programme of bilateral cooperation to combat terrorism, with measures to prevent and suppress the planning, organization, execution, support for or collaboration in, and financing of any terrorist act against the other party; and proposals concerning exchange of information and investigative and judicial cooperation. The second is a cooperation agreement to combat illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The third is an agreement on illegal trafficking in persons. Although the United States, on the slightest pretext, has refused even to consider them, Cuba still hopes that there will be a change in that policy.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">In the midst of the anthrax crisis, in October 2001, the United States Government was offered 100 million tablets of ciprofloxacin, and in November it was offered a supply of equipment for rapid low-cost typing of strains and spores. In August 2002, Cuba proposed joint investigation and research into the West Nile virus.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">It is impossible to eliminate terrorism if some terrorist acts are condemned while others are concealed, tolerated or justified. For ethical reasons, the use of the veto to block international action to protect the Palestinian people from Israeli State terrorism must end. There must also be an end to the American supplies of aircraft, helicopters and other means whereby that terrorism is carried out.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">Terrorism against Cuba continues to be carried out with absolute impunity from United States territory. In Havana on 16 June 1998, Cuba officially handed over to two high-ranking FBI officers incontestable, abundant and detailed evidence of those activities, which included 331 pages, record sheets of 64 known terrorists, 4 hours and 38 minutes of secret filming and 21 telephone interceptions. On 12 August, in Havana, <i>The New York Times</i> was exclusively provided, at its request, essentially the same information provided to the FBI two months earlier. Interviews with detained terrorists were allowed, and access was given to a Cuban agent who had infiltrated the Cuban American National Foundation and was living under cover.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">The only response from the FBI was to detain, on 12 September 1998, Gerardo Hernández, Ramón Labañino, Fernando González, René Gonzalez and Antonio Guerrero. As has been clearly shown, they were, with lofty altruism and courage, trying only to obtain information about terrorist groups based in Miami with a view to preventing their violent acts and saving the lives of Cuban and United States citizens.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa11">A civil court in Miami sentenced them to the maximum penalty, without the safeguards of due process, on false charges -- including charges that the District Attorney asked to be withdrawn due to lack of evidence -- and with a jury that was subjected to threats by terrorist groups and exposed to the intolerance of radical organizations and the anti-Cuban press. A number of known terrorists, called by the defence to testify, were protected by the Fifth Amendment.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa12">At the request of the United States Attorney General, the sentences of two of those men, who are United States citizens, include the following unusual paragraph, which insults the memory of the victims of 11 September, only three months after that crime was committed. It states:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg011-bk02-pa13">"As a further special condition of supervised release the defendant is prohibited from associating with or visiting specific places where individuals or groups such as terrorists, members of organizations advocating violence and organized crime figures are known to be or to frequent".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa14">The President of the United States has emphatically stated:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg011-bk02-pa15">"Justice demands that those who helped or harboured the terrorists be punished -- and punished severely. ... One of the things we will do is enforce the doctrine, part of the doctrine that says, 'If you harbour a terrorist, you're just as guilty as a terrorist'."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa16">And he launched a war on that premise.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa17">On 20 May 2002, President Bush made an offensive anti-Cuban speech in Miami. A photograph taken by United States television on that occasion shows the presence, on the podium a few feet away from the President, of Sixto Aquit Manrique, who was convicted in 1995 of carrying out an act of terrorism in Miami. In 1992 he took part in a plot to assassinate the President of Cuba. In 1993, he attacked the Maltese vessel  <i>Mykonos</i>. He is associated with an armed infiltration of Cuba on 17 October 1996. In 1998, the FBI was given a great deal of evidence relating to that individual.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa18">In another photograph taken at the same ceremony, Orlando Bosch Ávila can be seen in the front row. On 23 January 1989, the Acting Associate Attorney General of the United States, Joe Whitley, wrote, in a confidential decision to deny asylum to and deport Orlando Bosch after his illegal entry into the United States and his imprisonment in 1988, that the United States Government had confidential information confirming that "the bombing of a Cuban airlines aeroplane on 6 October 1976 was a CORU operation under the direction of Bosch". However, the order to deport Bosch, was cancelled, despite the fact that a court had endorsed the Department of Justice decision. He was pardoned by President George Bush in 1990 and granted residency in the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa19">In a radio broadcast, on 6 June 2002, and then on 16 June in <i>Diario de las Americas</i>, Orlando Bosch reiterated his call for the use of terrorism against Cuba. On 5 December 2002, the <i>Miami New Times</i> quoted Bosch, stating "All the people on the aeroplane were henchmen", in reference to the Cuban aeroplane that was bombed.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa20">Roberto Martín Pérez also appears in photographs of the 20 May ceremony. He is the head of the paramilitary group of the Cuban American National Foundation and one of the organizers of the plan to assassinate the Cuban President during the Ibero-American Summit on Margarita Island in November 1997. He was also an organizer of another, aborted, assassination attempt that was to take place during the CARIFORUM Summit in the Dominican Republic in August 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa21">The terrorist Rodolfo Frómeta Caballero, head of F-4 Commandos, issued a statement on 9 January 2003 in a Miami newspaper called <i>La Verdad</i>, declaring, "In 2003 we are still at war". Earlier, on 31 December 2002, the <i>El Nuevo Herald </i>had confirmed that his group had participated in an attack allegedly undertaken in Cuba. As if that were not enough, on 29 January 2003, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> referred to the alliance of that organization with Venezuelan groups resident in Miami, which organize and carry out military training with a view to confronting the constitutional Government of Venezuela. Information on that terrorist was likewise provided to the FBI.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa22">Posada Carriles, one of the perpetrators of the Cuban aeroplane bombing, was a CIA agent for many years. He escaped from a Venezuelan prison in an operation organized and financed by the Cuban American National Foundation. According to United States Senate records, he reappeared as one of the "Contra-gate" operators, receiving a salary from both the CIA and the United States Department of State. He travelled freely to Miami in 1997 and 1998. He was responsible for the bombing campaign against Havana hotels in 1997 that killed an Italian tourist and injured 12 Cubans. He also organized an assassination attempt against the Cuban President on the occasion of the Ibero-American Summit in Margarita Island. Now he is in prison in Panama, awaiting a trial on charges of trying to blow up, using 20 kilogrammes of C-4 and 50 packets of Semtex, a university auditorium during a speech by President Fidel Castro on 16 November 2000, in the presence of thousands of professors and students from Panama, on the occasion of another Ibero-American Summit.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa23">Dionisio Suárez was one of the most eloquent speakers to take part in a ceremony in Miami on 15 November 2002 to pay tribute to the terrorists detained in Panama. He served a 12-year prison sentence for the murder of a Chilean diplomat, Orlando Letelier, and the American citizen Ronnie Moffit. Referring to the acts that those terrorists had planned to carry out in Panama, Dionisio Suárez said, "They deserve respect; they deserve applause". Suárez, too, was invited to the presidential ceremony that took place on 20 May 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa24">On 11 November 2002, a Cuban AN-2 aircraft was hijacked and taken to United States territory. Instead of being put on trial, the eight hijackers were given asylum. Instead of being returned, the aircraft was auctioned off.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa25">Two weeks ago, on 7 February, during the "orange" antiterrorist alert in the United States, a military vessel from the Cuban coastguard service arrived at Key West without being intercepted and docked there. The vessel was carrying four armed men wearing camouflage fatigues. Although the vessel was returned, the hijackers have not been returned to Cuba and have not been charged.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa26">With complete impunity and with the complicity of United States authorities, funds are being collected in Miami for the purpose of financing terrorist acts. Bank accounts that finance terrorism are operating openly and normally; terrorists are being recruited; weapons supplies are being produced; safe haven is being provided. The territory is being use by those who finance, plan and carry out terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa27">Cuba expects the Security Council and the Counter-Terrorism Committee to take action. Does <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> not apply to the terrorism that, on an ongoing basis and with manifest impunity, is being undertaken from United States territory against Cuba?</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I again appeal to speakers not to exceed the agreed time of seven minutes for a statement. The matter is one of fairness to the speakers who follow. If we stick to our timetable, everybody will have a chance to make a statement to the Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Almansoor</span> <span class="nation">Bahrain</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">I should like at the outset to place on record my delegation's appreciation to you, Sir, for having convened this open meeting on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. We believe that the convening of these open meetings, with the participation of non-members of the Council, serves to support efforts to increase transparency in the work of the Council by engaging non-members in the deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">The subject under discussion today is a priority item in our work. Terrorism is a dangerous phenomenon that we must combat collectively. This phenomenon has recently intensified, and now commands the attention of the international community -- which has made strenuous efforts to fight it and to limit its catastrophic consequences, particularly the grave loss of life and property it causes.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">In that respect, we note that efforts at the United Nations to arrive at a definition of terrorism have yet to yield any results. We believe the time has come to step up international efforts to overcome the differences preventing us from arriving at a definition of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">The events of 11 September 2001 in the United States of America represented a dramatic turning point that shed light on the phenomenon of terrorism, which directly threatens the stability and security of States and international economic stability. The tragic events in Bali and Moscow, and Israel's acts of terror in the occupied Palestinian territories, are but links in the continuous chain of the acts of international terror that the international community must step up its efforts to combat.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">Bahrain, which is eager to see the international community engaged in combating this dangerous international phenomenon threatening peace and security and the stability of States, has extended its cooperation to the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) since it was established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We have provided the Committee with the reports required under paragraph 6 of that resolution. Bahrain submitted its national report on time and was among the first States to do so, because we believe that cooperating with the Committee will enhance international efforts to combat this phenomenon, which threatens the world and kills innocent people worldwide. The Kingdom of Bahrain also recently submitted the supplementary report required by the Committee. My country has taken every measure necessary to combat and stop the phenomenon of international terrorism. It has also ratified most of the international conventions pertaining to the fight against international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">The most important component of international terrorism is State terrorism, which we have witnessed in the Balkans, in particular in Kosovo and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. State terrorism continues in the occupied Arab territories. Such terrorism includes the Israeli Government's deliberate demolition of Palestinian homes, its displacement of Palestinians, its usurpation of their lands and the looting of their property. In that regard, my country calls on the international community to firmly and resolutely address this dangerous phenomenon, put an end to those inhumane practices and bring the perpetrators to international justice so that they may be duly punished.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">Israel continues to defy United Nations resolutions and to reject every peace initiative that would bring an end to its occupation of territory, which is, after all, a form of international terrorism. Israel has also rejected the peace initiative that was recently put forth by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz and adopted at the Arab Summit held in Beirut last March. Israel has also continued its policy of settler colonialism and population transfer, its terrorism against defenceless Palestinians, who are armed only with the determination to defy and resist Israeli terror. My country is gravely concerned about the policies being pursued by the Government of Israel against the Palestinian people in defiance of international humanitarian law, human rights law and international law and norms.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">There are many obstacles that stand in the way of international efforts to combat international terrorism, the most significant being the absence of a standard legal definition of this phenomenon. There are numerous differences on this matter, which are also blocking the adoption of a comprehensive international convention to combat international terrorism. We would like to stress the need to arrive at an accurate and comprehensive definition of terrorism. We also wish to highlight the need to distinguish between terrorism, which we condemn and oppose in all its forms and manifestations, and a people's legitimate struggle for independence and freedom. Short of that, our efforts will be incomplete, and our task extremely difficult. We would also like to stress that the phenomenon of terrorism is not linked to a given religion, culture or race. It is a global phenomenon that has recently taken on many forms and dimensions.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">In conclusion, I would like to express my delegation's appreciation for the efforts made by Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock as Chairman of the CTC, as well as for his unique and outstanding ability to reconcile his chairmanship with the duties entrusted to him as the Permanent Representative of his country to the United Nations. While stressing the need to discuss and address the root causes of terrorism, we would also like to reiterate our keen interest in cooperating positively with the Committee in order to bring about effective coordination among its members and adopt the measures necessary to put an end to this phenomenon.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Myanmar.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Swe</span> <span class="nation">Myanmar</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">I have the honour of speaking on behalf of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), namely, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and my own country, Myanmar.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">I am grateful to you, Mr. President, for taking the initiative to convene this public meeting on the important topic of terrorism. My appreciation also goes to France for having convened, on 20 January 2003, a high-level meeting of the Security Council on the subject of combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">On 4 October 2002, to mark first anniversary of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), we met in an open meeting of the Security Council. Barely a week after we met, on 12 October, another dastardly terrorist attack took place, in Bali, killing almost 200 persons, tourists and Indonesians alike. That struck at the heart of the ASEAN region, and we are particularly devastated by that cowardly attack.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">The tragic loss of life in Bali, as well as in Moscow and Mombassa, is a reminder that although we have made great efforts to combat terrorism through the adoption and implementation of far-reaching resolutions, success in combating international terrorism is still not fully ensured. Greater efforts are needed at the international, regional and country levels to intensify our fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">Allow me to give a further update on ASEAN's ongoing efforts to combat international terrorism. The devastating Bali attack came just one month before the ASEAN Summit that took place last year in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Combating terrorism remains high on the agenda of ASEAN members, both individually and collectively. The Phnom Penh Summit adopted a declaration on terrorism, in which ASEAN leaders expressed the determination of the Association to build on measures announced last year at its Summit in Brunei Darussalam to intensify its efforts to prevent, counter and suppress terrorist activities in the region. At the summit, ASEAN called on the international community to avoid indiscriminately advising their citizens not to visit or otherwise deal with ASEAN countries in the absence of established evidence to substantiate rumours of possible terrorist attacks, as such measures could help achieve the objectives of the terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">Cooperation among members of ASEAN to counter terrorism was further strengthened last year through increased intelligence sharing, as well as through workshops related to countering terrorism and other transnational crimes. ASEAN members had already planned on expanding their individual and collective efforts. Following the summit, ASEAN countries undertook the following activities. The International Conference on Anti-Terrorism and Tourism Recovery was held in Manila, the Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counter-Terrorism was established in November 2002 in Kuala Lumpur, and the regional conference on combating money laundering and terrorist financing took place in Bali in December. In January 2003 a workshop on terrorism was held in Jakarta, and Singapore hosted a workshop on counter-terrorism financing.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">Cooperation in countering terrorism has also been extended through the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which has continued to be an important mechanism in considering security-related issues in the region. Last year, ARF participants discussed measures against terrorism, as well as its financing. In March this year, an ARF intersessional meeting on counter-terrorism and transnational crime will be held in Malaysia. The ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime, with ministerial counterparts from China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, is to be held in Bangkok in October 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">On 1 August 2002, ASEAN and the United States signed the Joint Declaration on Cooperation to Combat International Terrorism. It provides a framework for cooperation in the prevention, disruption and combating of international terrorism through the exchange and flow of information, intelligence and capacity-building. The Declaration also provides for cooperation to enhance efficacy in the efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">Recently, at the ASEAN-European Union ministerial meeting in Brussels, the Joint Declaration on Cooperation to Combat Terrorism was adopted. The ministers agreed to enhance cooperation in areas including the exchange of information, strengthening links between law enforcement agencies of the European Union and ASEAN, and capacity-building to assist ASEAN members in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and to address the impact of terrorist activities.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">Evidently, countering terrorism remains high on the agenda of ASEAN, both individually and collectively. At this juncture, I would like to reassure the Council of ASEAN's commitment to the global fight against terrorism and specifically to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1456 (2003)</a>. I wish to inform the Council of ASEAN's intention to participate in the forthcoming special meeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee with international, regional and subregional organizations, scheduled for 7 March 2003. ASEAN takes note of the various proposals that were put forward at the last high-level meeting of the Council, including the French proposal to establish a cooperation and assistance fund.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa11">We find the open meetings of the Security Council, including this one, extremely valuable. Member States can learn what works in one particular country or region and have the option of adapting it to suit their unique environments and situations. It has helped us to identify and address inadequacies, including in terms of national legislation.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa12">We are also pleased with the latest efforts of the CTC, including the directory of assistance that is currently published on the web. The cooperation that the CTC is promoting is one of the many valuable ways in which it has helped to further the cause of our fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa13">Finally, I pay tribute to the Chairman of the CTC, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, and the CTC as a whole for their tireless efforts and their commendable achievements. The work of the CTC has been, indeed, a great contribution to efforts in countering terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Egypt.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aboul Gheit</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">There is no doubt that today's meeting of the Council to follow up on the ministerial meeting of 20 January on combating terrorism is an affirmation of the increased importance the Council gives to international efforts to combat international terrorism. It is a question that imposes itself forcefully on the international agenda. We are convinced that stepping up and coordinating these efforts within the framework of the United Nations is the only guarantee of their success. Terrorism cannot be eradicated nor can terrorists be controlled except through coordinated efforts by all countries of the world to achieve effective and concrete results.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">Given that, we were keen to participate in today's meeting to enrich the dialogue on this very important question. This meeting also affirms our belief in the importance and centrality of the role of the United Nations in the war against terrorism. We are convinced that the greater the international participation in this war, the closer we will be to achieving its objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">This war must be viewed as a process that would unify the countries of the world and preserve the security and safety of their citizens -- not the opposite. It must be collective, coordinated and balanced. It should avoid taking unilateral measures or antagonizing cultures, civilizations or religions merely because they are different. We should not be lacking in our enthusiasm to recall that the objective of all terrorism is to sow panic, terrorize people, destabilize countries and spread enmity. It is imperative that we not fall into the trap laid by terrorist elements by creating tension and disagreement in the international community. Therefore, we have to pay close attention soon to the importance of solidarity at this very delicate juncture. It is very important not to confuse terrorism with other political questions.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">Terrorism, as with all diseases faced by humankind throughout history, requires of us the following for its defeat: to define terrorism, distinguishing it from other phenomenon; to identify its causes and how to deal with them; and to choose the best means to combat terrorism. The best guarantee of that outcome is to carry out those tasks within a framework that affirms the primacy of international law and our commitment to the provisions of international law and international legality, foremost among which are the relevant United Nations resolutions and the provisions of international humanitarian law and human rights -- and, at the national level, to show commitment to national laws, legislation and the decisions of national courts.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">Allow me to comment briefly on some of the proposals contained in the report of the Secretary-General of 18 February (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-191.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/191</a>). Let me start with one proposal of special importance, which, if we agree to it, will have a positive impact on the international war against terrorism: the international community must develop interaction and dialogue among civilizations and religions. The United Nations must take an effective, leading role in such a dialogue, as it is the mother organization with the greatest ways and means to achieve concrete results in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">Among the proposals from the international community, we note that more than one member proposed that an international conference be convened under the auspices of the United Nations to define terrorism and to determine the common response of the international community to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Another member proposed the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to adopt new measures in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">Perhaps we should recall here that Egypt was the one that years ago called for the convening of an international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, to discuss terrorism-related issues. In this context, we would like to renew this call, and we hope that we can make progress and convene such a conference as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">Egypt also proposed that an international conference be convened to declare the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction. Egypt deems this extremely important and believes that it must be achieved as soon as possible, as a key element of international peace and security and a factor in promoting the stability of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">The CTC proves daily and undoubtedly that it is a vital and effective mechanism in the war against terrorism. It affirms the role of the United Nations as a successful instrument for the coordination of international efforts in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">Egypt maintains close and continuous cooperation and coordination with the Committee. To date Egypt has submitted three full reports to the Committee. The most recent one was submitted on 20 January and contained clarifications relating to Egyptian anti-terrorism legislation.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa11">On this occasion, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks and appreciation for the invaluable efforts made by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who is working tirelessly, objectively and in a balanced manner. We have full confidence in him and in his work as the head of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa12">Egypt is confident that this international Organization, as an effective mechanism representing international will and legitimacy, can assume a leading role in the combat against terrorism. Hence we look forward to the assumption by the United Nations of its responsibilities in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa13">Egypt will continue to support the efforts of the Organization and to cooperate with it, with a view to successfully combating international terrorism and eradicating its evils.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yauvoli</span> <span class="nation">Fiji</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">It is my honour to address the Security Council on behalf of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum group of countries which are members of the United Nations, namely Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country, Fiji.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">This meeting provides a useful opportunity to reflect on the efforts made to combat terrorism and associated transnational crime since the Security Council adopted the now-landmark <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> 16 months ago. That resolution brought a new element to the existing multilateral counter-terrorism framework and reflected a recognition of terrorism as a global problem which, if it is to be eliminated, requires cooperative action at the national, regional and international levels.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">The declaration adopted by Security Council Ministers of Foreign Affairs on 20 January 2003, under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>, further highlights the steps to be taken by States and organizations to strengthen international efforts to combat terrorism. It helpfully highlights those areas which require particular focus since the commencement of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). We welcome also the way in which the declaration recognizes the many threads that will contribute to effective action against international terrorism - including the implementation of Security Council resolutions and other legal obligations; cooperation with the CTC; mutual assistance and capacity- building; and the role of international and regional organizations. We also support the recognition given to ensuring that measures to combat terrorism comply with international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Member States, including the members of the Pacific Islands Forum, have worked -- despite many constraints -- to give effect to the obligations of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Counter-Terrorism Committee has played an important part in those efforts. The role of the CTC in monitoring implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> has undoubtedly assisted in prompting and focusing Government action. It has assisted States in identifying and defining the standards for action. The CTC's efforts in placing States in contact with available sources of assistance have contributed to the critical task of enhancing the capacity of States to take such action.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">We commend the Chairman of the CTC, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for his continuing leadership in the establishment of an open dialogue between Member States and the CTC. We also strongly support the CTC's initiative to meet with relevant regional and international organizations as a constructive way of establishing the dialogue necessary to "connect the dots". Our region will be contributing to that special session.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">We are grateful also to the team of experts assisting the CTC, and we appreciate in particular the CTC's decision to appoint Ambassador Ward as a special expert to facilitate the provision of assistance as required. As the work of the CTC continues to evolve, we look forward to its continuing efforts to engage directly with States on the basis of their identified needs.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">Much work has also been done at the regional level to give effect to the objectives of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The leaders of the Pacific expressed their political commitment to global counter-terrorism efforts through the adoption of the Nasonini Declaration on Regional Security in August last year. The Nasonini Declaration was not simply an expression of political intent. It also recognized the need for the Group to take concrete, practical measures to give effect to that intent, through law-enforcement cooperation and national strategies, to combat serious transnational crime, backed by a strong legislative base.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">In the six months since the Nasonini Declaration was issued, our members have continued to work to ensure that those practical measures are put in place. Using the <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> reporting requirements as a starting point, the Forum secretariat has now completed a regional review of national counter-terrorism, transnational crime and law-enforcement legislation and institutional frameworks. Model laws will now be prepared with the assistance of a regional expert working group, which will hold its first meeting next week, from 24 to 28 February, at the Forum secretariat in Suva, Fiji. Teams of expert drafters will make in-country visits to assist with adapting those model laws as required. Once completed, this project will see a robust and consistent framework of anti-terrorism legislation in place across the region.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">The Pacific Islands Forum is part of the Pacific Financial Intelligence Unit project. In that connection, the Forum secretariat, assisted by the International Monetary Fund and the secretariat of the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering, hosted a seminar on "Legislative Drafting for Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism Measures" in Fiji last month, from 27 to 31 January. Representatives from the 13 participating countries that attended the seminar included legislative drafters, prosecutors, financial intelligence unit officials, police officers and financial regulators. The seminar covered international standards and legislative drafting issues in the following areas: confiscation and provisional measures such as freezing and seizing property; international cooperation and mutual assistance; customer due diligence; financial intelligence units; suspicious-transactions reporting; and combating the financing of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">Such regional cooperation is critical in regions such as ours, where capacity limitations present a major challenge to many of our members. The reality experienced by small island developing States, particularly those scattered across such a large geographic expanse as ours, is something that we must work around. Several of our members are in dialogue with the CTC, and with Ambassador Ward in particular, but we are also looking at what more can be done regionally and bilaterally. We are conscious that there are some areas, such as vulnerability of banking and financial systems and transport infrastructure, particularly international airports, which require more work. Forum Island countries with a capacity to assist others recognize their special responsibilities in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">We in the Pacific recognize that there can be no standing still in the fight against terrorism. As recent events all too sadly show, no region is truly pacific when it comes to the threat of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">As we face the evolving challenge of terrorism, and as we work to implement the letter and the spirit of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the Security Council can be assured of the fullest support of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum group.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I call next on the representative of Liechtenstein.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wenaweser</span> <span class="nation">Liechtenstein</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">We became aware only this morning of your seven-minute time limit, Mr. President, but we have made every effort to shorten our speech; a fuller version will be distributed to members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">We view this meeting in conjunction with the high-level meeting of the members of the Council of one month ago and, of course, against the background of the declaration adopted on that occasion, annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>. That declaration calls on all States to take urgent action to prevent and suppress all active and passive support for terrorism, and to comply fully with the relevant resolutions of the Council, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We agree with the Council that efforts at the national level have to be redoubled. We also believe that such efforts have to build on global leadership, as provided by the Security Council and especially by the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">The declaration annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a> also states that the CTC must intensify its efforts to promote the implementation by Member States of all aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. After almost a year and a half of effective and transparent work under the most able guidance of Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the CTC today finds itself at a crucial juncture. The vast majority of States have cooperated with the Committee in its endeavour to monitor the adoption of legislation covering all aspects of the resolution, and to monitor national efforts in preventing and suppressing the financing of terrorist acts. Liechtenstein, by way of example, has already submitted its third written report to the Committee, thereby proving its commitment to a serious dialogue with the CTC and its experts. As a further expression of its willingness to contribute to the international fight against terrorism, the Government has submitted to Parliament a legislation package on countering terrorism, which will be discussed shortly. That package includes important amendments to the criminal code and will lead to the ratification of the last outstanding relevant international convention, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">It is clear that the CTC has been very successful in helping States identify gaps and shortcomings in their national legislation, thereby contributing to the visibility and acceptance of global standards on combating terrorism. The further the CTC goes in that way, however, the more pressing the question of the actual implementation of those standards becomes. Combating terrorism does not end, of course, with the universal ratification of all relevant conventions. Legislation is a necessary tool, but it can never be sufficient in itself. Therefore, the CTC must address the issue of compliance enhancement, in order to ensure a lowest common denominator of application, and, to that end, it must identify benchmarks that all States must meet.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">Transparency has been an important feature of the work of the CTC in the past and a crucial element of its success. Consistent with that approach, the Committee should therefore establish guidelines based on the principle of equal treatment of all Member States, which provide for a gradual and phased approach in ensuring compliance. Such guidelines should also draw from the experience of other international and regional bodies active in the area. The forthcoming special CTC meeting, on 7 March, with representatives of international, regional and subregional organizations will be an ideal occasion to exchange ideas and benefit from the experience of others with regard to best practices.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">Liechtenstein stands ready to make its contribution to such compliance-enhancement efforts with our expertise in relevant areas. We would be pleased to see the CTC further strengthen its role in the United Nations system through the innovative and dedicated work which thus far has granted the CTC such an outstanding position in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">The Security Council has declared that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism must comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular human rights and humanitarian law. The relationship between the fight against terrorism and the observance of human rights standards remains a high priority for us, and I wish to reiterate our conviction that human rights must never fall victim to the fight against terrorism. Since the Council last met in an open format in October, the General Assembly has pronounced itself on this very matter by unanimously adopting its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-219.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 57/219</a>, on protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">That text was drafted under the able leadership of the Mexican delegation, and we were very happy to sponsor that important resolution. The resolution recalls that certain human rights are recognized as non-derogable under any circumstances and that measures derogating from other rights must be exceptional and temporary in nature. It also gives an important role to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who has already made a very important contribution in his presentation to the CTC and also through his strong overall commitment to this cause.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">The balance that needs to be struck between the enjoyment of human rights and security concerns is certainly difficult to assess in each individual case and is all the more delicate when it comes to dangers of unprecedented magnitude. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that there are existing legal standards that address this dilemma and that there is even extensive legal practice on questions of the protection of human rights in times of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">As the recent past has made very clear, the United Nations plays a unique role in upholding the rule of law and in providing legitimacy to action taken with regard to situations that threaten international peace and security. Given the potential and actual dangers the fight against terrorism poses to established human rights, this Organization is called upon once again to live up to its role in upholding the rule of law in this common fight.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Rivero</span> <span class="nation">Peru</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">In my capacity as Coordinator of the Rio Group, I am making this statement on behalf of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, countries members of the main political coordination mechanism in Latin America.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">We thank Ambassador Greenstock for his briefing. The Rio Group wishes to convey to him our appreciation for the relevant work done at the head of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). The Committee's achievements, reflected in the high level of cooperation among States, the submission of information concerning national implementation of measures to combat terrorism and the strengthening of technical cooperation in that regard, attest to the very sound leadership of Ambassador Greenstock.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">Scarcely two weeks ago, on 7 February, a terrorist attack perpetrated in a social club in the centre of Bogotá again reminded us of terrorism's criminal and aberrant nature and of the serious threat that it poses to the peace and security of our countries. The Rio Group communiqué of 8 February, as well as resolution <i>(837 (1354/03))</i> of the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States (OAS) of 12 February, expressed their most vehement rejection and condemnation of that act and reaffirmed the intention to continue to cooperate to eradicate terrorism. We also endorse <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1465(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1465 (2003)</a>, which expresses condolences to the people and the Government of Colombia with regard to that that terrorist act.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">We must put an end to this scourge through all the means provided for in the Charter of the United Nations and in international treaties and norms, including those specified in the legal structure of the Organization of American States itself. The international community must act firmly, respecting the rule of law, international law and, in particular, human rights and humanitarian law. There is no other solution. The integrity, stability, democracy and freedom of our countries are at stake.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">Mindful of that reality, the countries members of the Rio Group have shown a prompt concern to work together to develop policies and actions to defeat terrorism. Evidence of that was seen in the Specialized Inter-American Conferences on Terrorism, held in Lima in 1996 and in Mar del Plata in 1998, which led to the creation of the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism within the framework of the Organization of American States. The Committee is carrying out intensive cooperation activities aimed at preventing, combating and eliminating terrorist acts and activities in accordance with work plans that are agreed upon periodically.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">Recently, the third regular session of the OAS Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism, held in January 2003, adopted the Declaration of San Salvador on Strengthening Cooperation in the Fight against Terrorism. Moreover, in June 2002, we adopted the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism. The Convention obligates all States of the Americas to prevent, combat and eradicate the financing of terrorism and to engage in effective cooperation to combat it.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">The Rio Group supports the declaration annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>, adopted by the Security Council meeting at the level of Ministers for Foreign Affairs on 20 January, as well as the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. All the members of the Rio Group have complied by submitting initial reports and supplementary reports to the Counter-Terrorism Committee. The gravity of the terrorist threat requires constant dialogue as well as intensified international cooperation and assistance in order to enable us to adopt effective measures to prevent, combat and eliminate this evil.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">As pointed out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1377(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1377 (2001)</a>, in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a> and in other relevant resolutions, the fight against terrorism demands resolute cooperation, not only of States but also of regional and subregional organizations and of the relevant agencies of the United Nations system. In that regard, the Rio Group, which has welcomed the significant regional progress made with regard to combating terrorism, looks forward with interest to the convening of the 7 March meeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, aimed at improving the flow of information about experiences, standards and practices and at coordinating the activities under way. We trust that that exercise will contribute to a joint plan of action in which each body will exploit its special characteristics to the utmost in the quest for a comprehensive measure to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">It is obvious that terrorism is not limited to the criminal activities of one particular organization or region. In that context, the Security Council -- which has affirmed that acts of terrorism are unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation and of who commits them -- must bear that consideration in mind in its efforts to identify, deter and punish those responsible for terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">In addition, the Rio Group believes that the draft comprehensive convention against terrorism cannot be further delayed. The difficulty we have encountered in finding a comprehensive and precise definition of terrorism does not justify its postponement. Rather, it is a challenge facing the international community, which must respond to that challenge in a responsible and timely way. Therefore, we remain hopeful that dialogue and understanding will enable us to conclude the work on the draft convention in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">The new demands of international cooperation require all Member States to maintain a constant attitude of vigilance and prevention, identifying and punishing activities that promote and defend violence within their jurisdictions as early signs of the knitting together of terrorist networks and of possible preparations for terrorist attacks. We cannot remain indifferent to the activities of persons or groups who obviously support terrorist organizations or who use the openness of free societies to support terrorist activities financially, politically or publicly. For that reason, we in the Rio Group welcome the legislation adopted by various countries that applies strict monitoring, tracking and punishment measures against those responsible for terrorist acts, as well as against those committing any act, of collaboration or fund-raising on their behalf.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa12">We must adopt a zero tolerance policy against terrorism and redouble international cooperation in all fields in order to counter terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Ukraine.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">I should like first of all to thank the German presidency for organizing today's meeting. I wish to extend our gratitude to the delegation of France for its important initiative of holding the ministerial meeting on this issue last month, which in fact gave new impetus to our common endeavours.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">Despite the fact that the world's attention is focused today on the Iraqi issue, the question of combating terrorism remains a top priority on the international agenda. Moreover, under the present circumstances, it is of critical importance to take further steps towards achieving the unity and coherence of the global anti-terrorism coalition.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Terrorism continues to be a major threat to international peace and security. After the events of 11 September 2001, the outbursts of terror in Moscow, Bali, Mombasa and Bogota reminded us that the problem of terrorism requires sustained, long-term and global action. In our view, the Security Council should continue to play a central role in promoting cooperation between Governments in the fight against terrorism, as was reiterated in the recently adopted ministerial declaration of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for its part, is making an extremely important practical contribution to the strengthening of anti-terrorism capabilities at the national, regional and global levels. We are pleased that the CTC has established constructive dialogue with Member States, first of all, in the spheres of strengthening national legislations and of combating terrorism financing. I should like also to express the full support of Ukraine for the efforts of the Committee to help countries to improve their counter-terrorism capabilities, specifically by developing the directory of sources of advice and expertise in the areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">However, this is only one part of the complex task confronting the Organization in its multifaceted undertaking. Others include addressing such global afflictions as arms smuggling, drug production and trafficking, and money-laundering. Every effort should be exerted to eliminate hatred and ethnic and religious intolerance, which continue to constitute a breeding ground for numerous conflicts. Recent developments in the world have underlined the importance of strengthening the regime of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery and related technologies. The delegation of Ukraine welcomes the fact that these issues were underlined in the recently adopted ministerial declaration of the Security Council. We consider it to be an important step towards ensuring the universality of all our endeavours in these directions.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">As terrorism is a threat of a complex character, the issue of combating the legalization of proceeds from crime -- which constitute one of the major sources of terrorism financing -- has become especially vital. In this regard, the high requirements of the Financial Action Task Force, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund represent a strong contribution to the consolidation of the efforts of the world community to prevent and rebuff these socially dangerous phenomena.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">The Government of Ukraine fully supports the international measures in this sphere, demonstrating its openness and readiness for cooperation. Paramount attention is being paid to the establishment of a comprehensive national system of combating money-laundering and terrorism financing. Most recently, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted a set of laws on the prevention of and counteraction to the legalization of the proceeds from crime. The Government has approved a programme of counteraction to the legalization of proceeds from crime for 2003. Today, the main task for Ukraine is to implement effectively its new anti-money-laundering legislation in order to eradicate any kind of possible support for terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">In our view, the exchange of information and sustained interaction between States, first of all on the regional level, has great potential for strengthening the global anti-terrorism coalition. In this context, various international conferences, forums and symposia greatly help to facilitate inter-State cooperation. One such international conference, of the Central and Eastern European States' experts on illegal immigration, was recently held in Kiev. It worked out a set of proposals for an international strategy to limit the spread of terrorism by strengthening immigration regimes. We believe that the conclusion of this and many other conferences will further deepen and contribute to our struggle against terrorism and deepen regional interaction aimed at combating terrorism, organized crime, illegal immigration and other threats.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">I will not focus on our national reports, which were submitted to the Committee, but let me stress one point. With the entry into force for Ukraine of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism in January this year, my country has become a party to all universal conventions and protocols on international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">Finally, I should like to express our gratitude to the Committee and to Ambassador Greenstock for his outstanding contribution to its work. I also wish that important body and its new Bureau every success in their future work. Let me reiterate Ukraine's readiness to continue closely cooperating with the CTC for the benefit of our common cause.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Colombia, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Giraldo</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Colombia welcomes and fully subscribes to the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Peru on behalf of the Rio Group. However, the Government of Colombia has decided to make a statement in this open debate of the Security Council in connection with the item "Threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts" because the terrorists acts that my country has suffered in recent months demonstrate the international dimension of the Colombian internal conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">In the name of the people and the Government of Colombia, allow me to extend our gratitude to this Council for the adoption last Thursday of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1465(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1465 (2003)</a> condemning the terrorist attack in Bogota on 7 February, in which 35 persons, a number of children among them, were killed and close to 200 were injured.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">Unfortunately, last Friday, the day following the adoption of that resolution, we had to lament not another car-bomb attack, but this time a house-bomb attack in the city of Neiva, in southern Colombia, that left 15 dead, several children among them, and more than 50 wounded and destroyed more than 70 homes belonging to poor people. Our country has undergone a surge in terrorism owing largely to the guerrillas of the so-called Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who have announced that there will be more terrorist acts of this kind.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">The Government of Colombia wishes to offer a few thoughts in this open meeting of the Security Council on terrorism. In our already protracted conflict, there are nowadays two inseparable aspects: the internal and the external. Generally speaking, only the first is considered: killings, attacks, terrorism, bombs, anti-personnel mines, kidnappings, extortion and illicit drug trafficking are all committed by armed illegal perpetrators and are carried out within our territory.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">With regard to this aspect, the Government of Colombia recognizes the obligations incumbent upon it. Taking as a paradigm respect for the constitution, the law, international treaties, human rights and international humanitarian law, my Government is stepping up the State's presence with larger numbers of better-trained soldiers and police officers with the mission to protect all Colombians. We seek to provide democratic security for civilians, unionists, human rights defenders, businesspeople and workers. This aspect, the internal one, is a variable that we Colombians must tackle and control.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">But there is another aspect of which little is spoken, namely the external aspect. The attacks to which I have referred were made possible by the deadly alliance between drug traffickers and the guerrillas, who finance themselves through that activity. The death-dealing explosives were negotiated for and acquired abroad and were paid for through external bank accounts fed by the drug trafficking. The chemical precursors that are essential to produce the illicit drugs reach Colombia through similar procedures. Generally speaking, the same process is used for the weapons that fuel our conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">That is why Colombia cannot stand alone in its fight against terrorism and its inseparable ally within and outside of the country: the worldwide problem of illicit drugs. Without the cooperation of the international community, not only in terms of money, but also in terms of legal and police activities such as those required by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, we shall not be able to combat this terrorism and its sponsor: drug trafficking.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">For this reason we turn to the United Nations so that, in keeping with its role in difficult times, as far as the international aspects of the Colombian internal conflict are concerned, it may indicate a course to follow and induce the international community to support peoples and States that are striving to preserve the lofty principles of the Organization and that daily struggle to protect the dignity of individual human beings.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">In reaffirming the support we expressed as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the work of the Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), under the wise leadership of Ambassador Greenstock, to combat this universal scourge, I wish to state our certainty that the Security Council will be able to meet the expectations of our peoples concerning its historic role in countering terrorism in all regions of the world.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Turkey, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cengizer</span> <span class="nation">Turkey</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">Only two days before the convening of this Security Council meeting, which deals with the international implications of modern forms of terrorism, a gruesome terrorist attack took place in the Republic of Korea. At the outset, therefore, I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the victims and convey the deepest sympathies of the Turkish people to the bereaved people of that friendly nation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">I also wish to congratulate our close friend Germany on successfully guiding the work of the Security Council during a very critical period, when diplomacy must show itself to be the art of conciliation that it in fact is and when we must all bring to the fore our best traditions.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">Unfortunately, acts of cowardice like the most recent one that took the lives of more than 120 innocent people resonate throughout the world, and, in a much undesired and equally twisted way, increase our awareness that, regardless of the many shapes that it cleverly assumes, terrorism in our time has indeed become a burning global issue that urgently requires greater and more effective international cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">In this last incident, for instance, we witnessed how easy it has become to acquire lethal weaponry and carry it into the midst of hundreds of people. While the Korean authorities were not able to readily connect the motivations of the terrorist to yet another "higher cause", what he achieved laid bare the deadly degree of sophistication that terrorists have reached today, whether they act individually or as part of a group.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">I am sure that every sane person in the world is wondering what ominous developments can possibly be taking place right now in many a clandestine quarter at a time when modern technological devices could end up in the hands of individuals or groups with terrorist intentions.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">Let me say at this juncture that Turkey has aligned itself with the European Union statement to be made shortly by the representative of Greece. Yet, given the relevance of the Turkish experience, and also the imminent bearing that this matter has on current events, I am taking the floor with a view to further stressing a number of points.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">I have already stressed one, namely that we urgently require greater and more effective international cooperation in combating terrorism. Indeed, we are dismayed to see that there are those who still equivocate when it comes to fully and completely denouncing terrorism. Whatever the merits of the need to address the so-called root causes of terrorism, it should be amply clear beforehand that we cannot start to grade and arrange in some neat order the forms of terrorism; nor can we rightfully grasp the motivations behind terrorism. We cannot come up with degrees of leniency towards terrorism. We cannot sensibly talk about "better terrorisms", because terrorism presumes violence, and terrorists are prepared to do everything in their power to achieve it. We have been saying that all along.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">Today, Turkey does not doubt that the nature of the threat faced by the world remains unchanged. The terrorist attacks in Bali, Mombassa and Bogotá confirm that sustained long-term action, solidarity among nations and concerted international action are only a few of the basic ingredients that we continue to require today in our fight against this scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">Ultimately, let us not temper our resolve with grief and regret. Let us not allow endless theorizing to hijack the practicalities of our common defence against this enemy of mankind and civilization. We have been saying that all along. Let us now see the need for strengthened mutual respect so that we can in all sincerity pool the timeless wisdom of the East and of the West. Let us understand, and help everyone comprehend, that no higher cause can benefit from acts of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">No longer does terrorism only strike at the very core of democracy and civil society; no longer does terrorism only hamper social and economic development. It does more than that. It has started to kill the very essence of civilization. It has started to repudiate the fundamental tenets and founding principles of civilizations the world over. Terrorists, in fact, disown the causes for which they purport to speak and act. In effect, they make their so-called higher causes ignominious causes.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa11">The world has had more than enough. The world has also had enough shoddy intellectualism. The world has had enough swayers, false prophets and spin doctors, all condoning, in one way or another, the inducement of fear and revulsion in masses of innocent people as a viable and genuine political method -- and more often than not influencing States in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa12">When we look into the history of terrorism, we clearly see that whenever political considerations exalt the idea of righteous murder, the basic truth of cold-blooded murder is immediately adulterated. Such was the case yesterday; it still is today. There is no way of getting around that basic fact -- especially when confronted by a slain body.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa13">That is why States should refrain from encouraging, assisting, facilitating and tolerating terrorist activities in their territory. Given the technical prowess of modern-day terrorists, and the capabilities of modern technology, as well as the relative ease of communications, transportation and border crossings, abetting terrorist groups has now become tantamount to knowingly organizing terrorist groups.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa14">In a world where terrorists can plan and operate on a global scale, establishing institutionalized cooperation among States and ensuring the smooth working of the relevant international conventions are stark priorities. Likewise, States should reinstate mechanisms to follow the flow of funds that are often coercively generated and controlled by suspected or overtly radical groups. Indeed, the nexus of money-laundering, arms trafficking and drug trafficking, which we so often encounter whenever we delve into the intricacies of worldwide networking among criminal and terrorist groups, cannot be allowed to fester so as to form part of yet another culture of impunity.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa15">There is every reason for strengthened international cooperation, and we should take forthwith the necessary steps in that direction. No longer should terrorists groups be able to have such easy access to logistical means and instruments.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa16">Last but not least, Turkey attaches the utmost importance to current work at the United Nations and supports the full and complete implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1368(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> and others, which together constitute a solid framework for our Organization to play a role befitting its ideals and its unique universality. They should be recognized in their totality as an important breakthrough in our common struggle against terrorism. We also welcome the declaration annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1456 (2003)</a> of 20 January, reaffirming the seriousness of the threat posed by terrorist acts and calling for further cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa17">We highly commend the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and welcome its initiative to hold a special meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations on 7 March. We are grateful to its Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa18">Turkey, a party to all 12 international United Nations conventions on this subject, looks forward to further progress in the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly with regard to a draft comprehensive convention against international terrorism and on a draft international convention on the suppression of nuclear terrorism. They will complement the legal infrastructure that is in the making today.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa19">I wish to conclude by calling upon all States to fully implement the bilateral, regional and multilateral anti-terrorist conventions to which they are parties. I also call upon those States that have not yet done so to become parties to the anti-terrorist conventions adopted under the auspices of this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa20">Indeed, we must ensure that there is no safe haven for terrorists and resist all tendencies to entertain any remaining temptation in that regard.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Yemen, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Alsaidi</span> <span class="nation">Yemen</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">I would like to take this opportunity once again to express our admiration to you, Mr. President, for the way in which you have been guiding the work of the Council. We would also like to thank your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of France.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">When we review the actions of the Council in implementing its resolutions to combat international terrorism, we feel a sense of optimism with regard to the consensus within the Council and the United Nations as a whole in opposing that serious phenomenon. The declaration annexed to the recent Council resolution on this subject -- <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a> -- provides for specific procedures and measures whose implementation is designed to provide significant impetus for concerted action in that sphere.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">The position of the Republic of Yemen on international terrorism is well known; we have made it clear on many occasions. However, it is always important to reaffirm that the phenomenon of international terrorism remains one of the most serious issues facing the international community. Terrorism is a criminal act that is not directed at a specific culture, religion or race. It does not stop at the borders of States. It is a scourge that can strike all of us. It thus requires the coordination of efforts with a view to providing guidance based on a clear analysis of the causes of the phenomenon and an understanding of its underlying roots and of the remedies needed to combat those symptoms.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">The Republic of Yemen is gratified that the international community is aware of the seriousness of the problem. We welcome the international consensus on the need to combat the scourge of terrorism with a view to its elimination. The Republic of Yemen was among the first States to draw attention to this phenomenon for one simple reason: the State of Yemen suffered from that scourge two years after its establishment. Terrorism is increasing in my country; 17 acts of terrorism have taken place there to date. There is no doubt that those acts were designed to destabilize the State, endanger peace and political security and hamper development efforts. We estimate that the material damage resulting from that phenomenon is costing us $1.8 billion annually.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">Aware of the seriousness of such destructive acts, the Government of the Republic of Yemen attaches priority to combating terrorism. We have adopted measures and procedures aimed at containing and eliminating terrorism. We will not list all of them here, but some of the measures have been described in the national report submitted to the Counter-Terrorism Committee in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-240.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/240</a>, following the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001. The measures have also been described in the answers and clarifications provided to the Committee. The Government of the Republic of Yemen is working at the national level, in coordination with other States, including the United States, to implement further measures for the future. We will also be describing those to the Committee in future reports. We have also notified most regional and international conventions on terrorism. We are currently working on enacting further legislation on this subject.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">With regard to the recent Council resolution in this area, we feel that international efforts lack the legal framework that should underlie policies and practices undertaken by States alone or collectively. We would like to reaffirm that the delegation of Yemen will spare no effort to achieve agreement on draft international convention, and we would like to thank India for its work on the draft text.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">In this context, we associate ourselves with the view expressed by a number of delegations that an international convention must give equal emphasis to all terrorist acts, whether waged by individuals, groups or States. As a matter of principle, we will not be able to accept language that deprives peoples of their legitimate right to resist occupation, and we are committed to the principle that a distinction must be made between terrorism and legitimate resistance.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">The international positions on the need to fight terrorism after the 11 September 2001 attacks give us cause for optimism. Specific and coordinated measures have been adopted, and affected and interested States have begun to implement those measures to bring an end to this scourge. However, certain practices do not in fact serve the cause that they are designed to serve and threaten international consensus on this issue. We have noticed that there is a ferocious campaign under way to falsely identify Islam with terrorism. This is slander intended to achieve insidious goals alien to our joint campaign against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">Many of us have warned of the danger of selectivity and double standards in the implementation of international resolutions, in particular those pertaining to the Middle East. We do not believe that Palestinians can be deprived of their legitimate right to resist occupation and settler colonialism. There are those who in effect endorse the crimes of the Israeli settlers and Israel's colonization policies.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">In conclusion, I wish to express our gratitude for and acknowledgement of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the efforts and wise leadership of its Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock. I also wish to reaffirm our readiness to do everything we can to strengthen international cooperation and further develop the efforts to eliminate the scourge and evil of terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Greece.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vassilakis</span> <span class="nation">Greece</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding countries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, the associated countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, and the European Free Trade Association member of the European Economic Area Norway have aligned themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">The European Union welcomes this new opportunity to hold an open debate on the issue of terrorism and to review the important task undertaken by the Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">The crime of terrorism is one of the most serious common challenges facing the international community today. Terrorism constitutes an acute threat to internal and external security, to peaceful relations between States and to the development and functioning of democratic institutions and principles. The European Union categorically condemns all acts of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, irrespective of their motivation, form and manifestation, and firmly believes that those who perpetrate, organize and sponsor terrorist acts must be brought to justice and duly punished.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">The horrific terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 made it clear that terrorism is a global challenge and that the fight against it requires concerted global action. The fight against terrorism has been, and continues to be, a top priority for the European Union and its member States. The Union believes, however, that the fight against this scourge must be carried out in accordance with the rule of law and international law, including human rights law and, in the case of an armed conflict, humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">The European Union recognizes the central role of the United Nations in this respect and remains committed to support the Organization in its endeavours in this field. Universal implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and other Security Council resolutions on counter-terrorism is a matter of continuing priority and urgency to the Union and to its member States.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">The European Union wishes to congratulate the CTC on carrying out its work with determination, dedication and transparency, and to offer to it its full support and cooperation. The Committee represents a milestone in the fight against terrorism, as it provides the Security Council with an effective follow-up mechanism to thoroughly monitor the universal implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We would also like to pay tribute to the Chairman of the CTC, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for the excellent job he has done. Under his guidance and advice the Committee has found its way to successfully deal with the many challenges it has faced and to chart a sure course for the future.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">The European Union supports the confidential dialogue that the Committee has established with interested States, as well as the advice and guidance that it offers them with a view to implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. That dialogue also allows the Committee to identify the need for technical assistance to those States and to communicate to donor States the needs for such assistance. As Sir Jeremy Greenstock pointed out at the Security Council ministerial meeting of 20 January, the majority of Member States throughout the world have begun to respond to the challenge laid down in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The European Union would like to urge Member States that have not yet submitted a report to the CTC to fulfil their obligation within the allocated time frame.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">In that connection, the European Union welcomes the declaration annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>, which was adopted by the Security Council at its ministerial meeting of 20 January and which reaffirms the severity of the threat posed by terrorist acts and calls on all States to take urgent action to prevent and suppress such acts. The declaration also calls upon the Counter-Terrorism Committee to intensify its efforts to promote the implementation by Member States of all aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa09">The European Union also recognizes the role of the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the Centre for International Crime Prevention to strengthen the capabilities of the United Nations in the prevention of terrorism and to offer advice on the implementation of both the pertinent Security Council resolutions and United Nations legal instruments against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa10">The European Union, for its part, is playing an important role in providing assistance to third countries in their efforts to better implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In that respect, it has identified a number of pilot countries for the purpose of launching new assistance projects in the field of counter-terrorism. The criteria applied in the identification of those countries are relevance to the fight against terrorism, significance to European Union foreign policy, technical assistance needs, readiness to cooperate and the existence of European Union comparative advantages.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa11">The European Union and its member States are fully committed to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Union has already submitted three reports to the CTC, the first two of which are contained in documents <a href="../pdf/S-2001-1297.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/1297</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2002-928.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/928</a>. The latest one was submitted last month with a view to the upcoming special meeting scheduled for 7 March 2003. Those reports detail specific action undertaken to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The latest report lists the recent legislation adopted by the Union in the areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, as well as the regulatory measures that provide for the freezing of the funds, financial assets and economic resources of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorism and for the prohibition of the provision of financial services to them.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa12">The European Union has also established an executive mechanism to prevent and suppress terrorist financing, through which it develops and reviews, on a regular basis, a common list of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist acts. In addition, plans are being developed to improve police cooperation and enhance judicial cooperation in member States. The European arrest warrant, which provides for simplified surrender procedures between judicial authorities of member States based upon the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions, also covers terrorist offences.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa13">The European Union has also developed close cooperation with third countries in the field of counter-terrorism, particularly through an expanded structured dialogue. In that respect, anti-terrorism clauses have been included in the Union's contractual relations with third countries. Close cooperation on these issues has also been established between the European Union and regional bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa14">The European Union is of the view that the 12 United Nations conventions and protocols and their implementation play a pivotal role in the fight against terrorism, and its member States are committed to the ratification and rapid implementation of all those conventions through the adoption of Common Position 930 of the Council of the European Union, of 27 December 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa15">The European Union also supports the early conclusion by consensus of negotiations on the draft comprehensive convention on terrorism and the adoption of the draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism, in particular in view of the risk posed by certain terrorist groups that have gained access to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa16">The European Union wishes to express its full support for the statement made by the President of the Security Council (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-38.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/38</a>) on behalf of the Council on 17 December 2002, in which the Security Council notes the key role played by international, regional and subregional organizations in supporting Government capacity-strengthening on counter-terrorism and in furthering the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In the same statement, the Security Council encourages the CTC to build a dialogue with international, regional and subregional organizations in areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Council also requests the CTC, with a view to improving the flow of information on experiences, standards and best practices and to coordinating ongoing activity, to invite all relevant international, regional and subregional organizations to a special meeting on 7 March 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa17">The European Union is also of the view that regional, international and subregional organizations play an important role in the fight against terrorism and that closer cooperation with the CTC would enhance their efforts and would contribute to a better implementation by their member States of their obligations in this field. The European Union welcomes the convening of the special meeting of the CTC and believes that the meeting will provide a good opportunity for those participating in it to explore the matters that are covered by the declaration of the Security Council of 20 January 2003 (<a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>, annex), as was also requested by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa18">The European Union also noted that some proposals were made during the Security Council's ministerial-level meeting dedicated to counter-terrorism held on 20 January in order to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the fight against terrorism. It is the wish of the European Union that follow-up be given to those proposals in the competent organs of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa19">With respect to the latter aspect, on 10 December 2001 the European Union launched a targeted initiative aimed at reducing the risk of non-State actors gaining access to weapons of mass destruction, radioactive materials and means of delivery. That initiative, which was supplemented by a list of concrete implementation measures adopted by European Union foreign ministers on 15 April 2002, encompasses the following four main elements: strengthening the relevant multilateral instruments in the field of disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation; improving export controls; strengthening disarmament cooperation; and enhancing political dialogue with third States.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Argentina.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cappagli</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">The Argentine Republic associates itself with the statement made by Peru on behalf of the Rio Group. We are grateful for this opportunity to continue the debate on international terrorism, which the foreign ministers of countries members of the Security Council began on 20 January. In Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya and Russia, among other places, there have recently been terrible attacks of horrifying brutality, which make this debate all the more relevant.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">In 1992, international terrorism attacked the Argentine Republic, destroying the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. In 1994, the attack on Argentina was repeated with the destruction of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina, the most important organization of the Jewish community in Argentina. Those two attacks left more than 100 dead. The organization that carried out those attacks was mistaken if it thought it was attacking only the Jewish community in my country. They were an attack on the entire community of Argentina, and Argentina understood them as such.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">More than a decade ago, referring to the 17 March 1992 attack, the Foreign Minister of the Argentine Republic, Guido di Tella, stated in the General Assembly that,</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">"As for terrorism, there can be no questions, only an answer in the form of the strongest, most determined and implacable commitment of each State to struggle against it until it is eradicated." (<i><a href="../pdf/A-47-PV.5.pdf" class="nolink">A/47/PV.5</a>, p. 77</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">On 27 July 1994, after the second terrorist attack to which I referred, my country sent a letter urging the Security Council to step up cooperation to counter such crimes (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-890.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/890</a>). The Council echoed that request in its presidential statement of 29 July of that year (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-40.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/40</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa06">Argentina has always maintained, and repeated during its recent term on the Security Council, that it regards all terrorist acts without exception to be criminal and unjustifiable. The criminal character of terrorism is independent of whatever motivation or justification is invoked. Nothing excuses it. Terrorism is a grave threat to international peace and security. My country condemns unreservedly all acts of terrorism and reaffirms the need to step up international cooperation to prevent and combat them. In the view of the Argentine Republic, this struggle should be legally legitimate and grounded in respect for international law, human rights and the United Nations Charter, as is stated, inter alia, in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-122.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 48/122</a> on human rights and terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa07">In order to maximize its strength, terrorism joins forces with transnational crime, uses new technologies, obtains weapons of mass destruction and exploits loopholes in the world financial system. That trend can be seen, for example, in the case of Colombia, where terrorism has allied itself with drug trafficking.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa08">Just as this crime transcends the borders of a given country, the response to it must necessarily also transcend borders. As the Secretary-General affirmed, the United Nations enjoys a unique position for building a universal coalition to guarantee global legitimacy in the long-term response to terrorism. Its role is therefore essential, and Argentina supports it unreservedly.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa09">Terrorism is an assault on human life and seeks to destroy principles, rules of civilization and values that are common to all humanity. It is a murderous, pitiless, inhuman and ferocious phenomenon that disrupts the coexistence of human beings. For that reason, it is one of the most serious and certain threats to the peace of the planet. The Security Council, the General Assembly, the specialized United Nations agencies and regional organizations have long recognized that.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa10">Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Security Council set up the Counter-Terrorism Committee, which has demonstrated its effectiveness under the intelligent leadership of the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, to whom we pay tribute for his work.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa11">Argentina has supported all provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and from the outset it has cooperated with the Committee, which is a vital tool for coordinating counter-terrorism activities. My country has submitted the report required under paragraph 6 of the resolution and a second, supplementary report.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa12">We feel that, in addition to help States improve their legislation, the Committee should cooperate in monitoring their practical implementation. Cooperation with regional organizations is also important, in our view, and should be expanded. We therefore welcome the initiative of increasing such contacts and of holding a meeting with those organizations on 7 March.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa13">Successful global cooperation to counter terrorism must be based on a universally valid legal framework. For that reason, we urge States to ratify existing conventions. We agree that there is a need to redouble efforts to reach consensus on the draft comprehensive convention and the convention on nuclear terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa14">There is another aspect of the combat against terrorism that we should not overlook. The Secretary-General, on 20 January, reminded us that, just as terrorism cannot be justified, neither we ignore the injustices that criminals use as a pretext for it -- injustices such as extreme poverty, for example.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa15">Underlying all these problems of insecurity are the tremendous injustices and inequities besetting the international community at this time. Only two years ago, we adopted the Millennium Declaration, a text that now has more force and validity than ever. Its purposes and goals should have assisted us in taking broader approaches to defeating groups that feel themselves to be marginalized and desperate and that use those root causes as an excuse for terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa16">However, since the Millennium Declaration, much has happened, and many new factors have emerged that are causing fear, mistrust, poverty and despair. We must understand that the concept of security is now broader than it was traditionally.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa17">We note with gratification that the Security Council has begin to consider these problems expressly. The declaration on combating terrorism of 12 November 2001 affirms that development-related issues must be addressed in order to wage a broader war against that scourge. Extreme poverty and the internal and external causes that contribute to causing it are not, therefore, irrelevant to the agenda of the Council, in that they serve as a pretext for serious threats to security.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa18">The countries of the Group of Seven -- a number of which are represented here on the Council -- will understand that this is something they must see and that they can do something in the effort to resolve these problems, which, to a large extent, stem from unjust trade barriers and the failure to meet targets for official development assistance, technology transfer and investment.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa19">We should not overlook the climate of despair that generates insecurity and terrorism. The industrialized countries and the developing ones will one day have to form a coalition for prosperity and justice, the two most effective instruments to free the world of insecurity, thereby depriving of their arguments those who so perversely exploit the needs and the despair of the peoples of the developing countries.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of South Africa, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Ndhlovu</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, I would like to convey my delegation's appreciation to you for convening this important follow-up discussion to the 20 January ministerial-level debate on combating terrorism. I would like also to thank Ambassador Greenstock of the United Kingdom for the exemplary manner in which he has chaired the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). Under Ambassador Greenstock's chairmanship, the Counter-Terrorism Committee has set new standards of transparency for the Security Council and has established effective dialogue with States Members of the United Nations on how best to enhance our collective capacity to combat the scourge of international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa02">South Africa and other African countries have fully engaged in the process of self-assessment of our legislative and executive machinery, initiated by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. With the assistance of the CTC's counter-terrorism experts, we have identified areas that need to be strengthened in our legislative framework for combating terrorism, and we are taking the necessary corrective actions. South Africa has submitted three comprehensive national reports pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and will continue to work closely with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Security Council in order further to refine and improve national and regional counter-terrorism capabilities. South Africa has also seconded one of its experts in drafting counter-terrorism legislation to serve in the CTC's core group of experts.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa03">The ministerial-level debate in the Security Council on 20 January highlighted the importance of preserving the remarkable and unprecedented level of international cooperation that has existed in fighting terrorism since the tragic events of 11 September 2001 and the recent terrorist attacks carried out in Indonesia, Colombia, the Russian Federation and Kenya. Some speakers rightly stressed the fact that we should not allow ourselves to become divided by new and controversial military campaigns that would only distract our focus from the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa04">The message that clearly emanated from the ministerial debate is that no individual Government can hope to unilaterally defeat non-State terrorist actors that operate with sophisticated technologies, communications and resources on a global scale, virtually oblivious to State boundaries. It is equally apparent that multilateral cooperation and respect for international law, human rights and global norms regarding the protection of civil liberties should constitute the bedrock of our collective effort to eradicate the scourge of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa05">As the Council correctly stated in the declaration annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg030-bk02-pa06">"terrorism can only be defeated, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, by a sustained comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States, international and regional organizations, and by redoubled efforts at the national level."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa07">Such a comprehensive approach necessitates addressing the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty, human rights abuses and foreign occupation. Terrorists take advantage of the sense of despair and frustration that breeds wherever people are forced to live without hope and without freedom. No legislative measures and no amount of police action, intelligence-gathering or military force can ever guarantee our safety as long as the basic needs of millions of disaffected and marginalized people across the world continue to be overlooked.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa08">Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Middle East, where the Palestinian people have been subjected to the devastating impact of more than 30 years of illegal occupation and the daily humiliations and sufferings associated with Israel's violent policy of settlement expansionism. The success or failure of the Security Council's counter-terrorism efforts largely depends on how it addresses crises such as those in Palestine and other occupied territories.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa09">Terrorism is but one of a number of often interrelated threats to our security. In southern Africa, as in many other parts of the world, millions of people are still threatened by starvation and poverty. State resources that are already stretched to breaking point in some countries to address the issue of food security are ill-equipped to handle the complexities of counter-terrorism. It is therefore important that the Security Council harbour realistic expectations of Member States and intensify its efforts to make counter-terrorism assistance available to those in need. I make this point because the CTC will soon expect States to take more substantive measures to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa10">One specific issue South Africa would like the Security Council and the CTC to consider relates to public perceptions with regard to terrorism. Many countries, particularly in the developed North, issue vague, non-specific and unsubstantiated statements or advisories warning their citizens of the potential threat of terrorist attacks abroad. Such unsubstantiated and selective statements have a negative impact not only on a country's standing, but also on its security situation. Furthermore, such advisories could cause immense damage to the economies of the developing nations of the South by adversely affecting foreign investment and tourism.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa11">The reality, however, is that the threat of terrorism is as great, if not greater, in the cities and tourist resorts of the North. It is my Government's view that, in instances where credible intelligence concerning potential terrorist attacks is obtained, that information should be handed over the to the relevant foreign authorities so that preventive action may be taken.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa12">South Africa and other African countries remain firmly committed to the fight against terrorism and look forward to increased interaction and ongoing cooperation with other States, the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Security Council on this issue.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa01">I call on the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg031-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zarif</span> <span class="nation">Iran</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa01">Allow me to begin by expressing my appreciation to you, Mr. President, for having convening this meeting, to the Secretary-General for his thoughtful remarks on 20 January and to Ambassador Greenstock for his able leadership and his briefing to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa02">The Islamic Republic of Iran, as a country that has suffered immensely from acts of terrorism, has a strong interest in the subject and is determined to leave no stone unturned in achieving the objectives set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In this process, we have thus far submitted our initial and supplementary reports to the Committee. With a view to implementing the resolution, my Government has established a National Coordination Committee to facilitate the implementation of the resolution. As a result, while many existing laws make terrorist acts punishable, two pieces of comprehensive draft legislation, namely the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Anti-Money-Laundering Act, are under consideration in the Cabinet and the Parliament. The latter, in accordance with Security Council resolutions, aims at setting out a legal and practical mechanism to effectively halt financial and other support to terrorist organizations and groups, while the former addresses the issue in all its other aspects. Pending their adoption, and in conformity with existing laws, practical arrangements have also been made to increase security in sensitive areas and to enhance the anti-money-laundering mechanisms of the banking system.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa03">Special measures adopted along Iran's long and porous eastern border, right after the tragedy of 11 September 2001, with a view to interdicting Al Qaeda infiltration, continue consistently. Iranian law enforcement agencies are also engaged in extensive operations to arrest any suspected terrorists that might have entered Iranian territory from neighbouring countries. As a result of such activities, thus far several hundred foreign nationals suspected of being involved in terrorist activities have been arrested and then handed over to the Governments of their countries of origin.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa04">Terrorism is a persistent menace that requires a continued global response. The tragic loss of life in terrorist attacks such as those committed in the past several months clearly demonstrates that success in countering the threat remains elusive. It underlines the need for continued and more extensive cooperation at the international level, which can be possible and effective only if the United Nations plays a central and coordinating role by setting effective international norms and issuing a clear message about the unacceptability of acts of violence targeting civilians.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa05">Undoubtedly, more cooperation on combating terrorism requires more understanding among nations and less tension and conflict. As the Secretary-General emphasized in the Council on 20 January 2003,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg031-bk02-pa06">"we must never lose sight of the fact that any sacrifice of freedom or the rule of law within States -- or any generation of new tensions between States in the name of anti-terrorism -- will hand the terrorists a victory that no act of theirs alone could possibly bring". (<i><a href="../html/S-PV-4688.html">S/PV.4688</a>, p. 3</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa07">I should also caution against some attempts aimed at seeking to misuse the campaign against terror by denigrating and suppressing the legitimate rights of peoples, particularly the people of Palestine, to self-determination. Undoubtedly, such misuse does not help advance the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa08">Before concluding, I would like to underline the necessity of addressing more seriously and in an institutionalized framework the strong links among terrorism, drug trafficking and transnational organized crime. The Islamic Republic of Iran has suffered tremendously in combating drug trafficking emanating from Afghanistan. Today, in spite of the efforts of the Afghan Government, drug trafficking continues to provide the financial backbone of terrorists and forces of instability in Afghanistan, threatening the impressive achievement of the international community and the Afghan people.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa09">Given the fact that drug trafficking is inseparable from terrorism and is being carried out by well-organized and well-equipped international gangs that enjoy connections in various continents, there should be no doubt that combating it goes beyond the resources of individual countries. In that context, we view as welcome developments the reference, in paragraph 4 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, to "the close connection between international terrorism and transnational organized crime, illicit drugs..." and other things, and the emphasis in the same paragraph on</p>
	<blockquote id="pg031-bk02-pa10">"the need to enhance coordination of efforts on national, subregional, regional and international levels in order to strengthen a global response to this serious challenge and threat to international security".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa11">We note that the CTC has yet to take action with a view to implementing that paragraph of the resolution. It is our hope and expectation that the Committee will consider measures to address that important aspect of global terrorism as well.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk01-pa01">I call next on the representative of Albania.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg032-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dilja</span> <span class="nation">Albania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa01">Let me state at the very beginning how appropriate my delegation finds this open debate on the very important issue of combating terrorism. We thank you for this, Mr. President, and feel deeply motivated to make our contribution here.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa02">Let me also pay tribute to the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and to its Chairman, Ambassador Greenstock, for the excellent stewardship and excellent work in ensuring implementation by all Member States of an effective counter-terrorism strategy. The CTC has really become an important and respected agent for international consensus on counter-terrorism. I would like to reiterate that my delegation shares the determination of the Security Council to keep up the momentum of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and fully supports the ministerial declaration recently adopted by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>. We consider it to set the agenda for a further thrust in the fight against terrorism, and we agree with its messages and recommendations, and intend to comply with them.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa03">Terrorism is global. We have all agreed to simply translate that as global responsibility for fighting it -- as the responsibility of any one of the members of the global community. Our delegation is aware of that responsibility and, with precisely that awareness, comes here today to reconfirm its active membership in the international coalition against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa04">The memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 and of the victims of subsequent attacks in Moscow, Karachi, Bali, and other places forever inspires us to fight terrorism with the utmost determination. It also reminds us that terrorism threatens all countries and all peoples. From that sad history, we all draw the lesson that in the face of terrorism, we are duty-bound to mobilize collectively and to undertake constant vigorous action -- all of us together and each of us separately -- in order to fight it with clear goals and positive results. The Government of Albania commends all that has already been done at the United Nations in the fight against terrorism. We appreciate the vital role played by the Security Council, and we acknowledge, in particular, the activity of the indispensable CTC. Albania fully recognizes its obligations as a Member of this international body and firmly declares that it will remain an active participant and collaborator in the global coalition against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa05">We are fully aware that much more remains to be done, and that we need to do better. We should mobilize greater resources and should be vigilant and committed, not be tolerant, not content to rest on our laurels. We should be more imaginative. We are fully aware that we should, in particular, redouble our efforts at the national level in any area that is directly or indirectly related to terrorism or that facilitates a terrorist environment and terrorist activity, such as organized crime, illicit drugs, drug trafficking or money-laundering, among other things.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa06">Our awareness is also being translated into action -- affirmative action -- supported and assisted by any international sources of assistance and guidance available to us. The Albanian Government and Albanian institutions have made counter-terrorism a major priority on their agendas. The implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is a daily endeavour for us. We have focused on the areas that need to be tackled first. We have worked to adopt legislation covering various aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and we shall continue to do so. We are constantly working to establish an effective executive mechanism for the prevention of terrorist financing. We have ratified or are in the process of ratifying various international conventions and protocols related to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa07">Our delegation urges this international body, the Security Council, and the Counter-Terrorism Committee to continue to keep this issue at the top of their agendas, to continue to recognize and shoulder this special responsibility and to continue to call on any Member State -- including my country -- for responsible action. We should all help to ensure that the CTC remains -- as Ambassador Greenstock nicely and correctly put it -- a committee with a continued sense of purpose, direction and momentum. Albania will provide its modest contribution. We shall take our place and shall remain in the front seats aboard the anti-terrorist vehicle that the Committee is driving.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, let me reiterate that terrorism is a universal evil and that it calls for a universal fight. We should win that fight; our fate is in our hands. A famous philosopher defined history as the sum total of things that could have been avoided. My delegation's firm conviction is that, together, we shall write the history of this global endeavour against terrorism as the sum total of the good things that did happen: as a history of success.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg033-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Heinbecker</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa01">Canada wishes to express its gratitude to the Security Council for having organized this public debate on threats to international peace and security. We note that this is, in fact, the continuation of a debate begun a month ago at a meeting that resulted in the creation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>. We should like to take this opportunity to express our opinion on that resolution, as well as on the larger United Nations framework devoted to the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa02">Canada believes that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a> makes an important contribution to the foundation laid by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and to the existing international legal counter-terrorism framework.</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline-spokein" id="pg034-bk01">

<div class="spoken" id="pg034-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Heinbecker</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa01">An important thread woven throughout this most recent resolution is cooperation. We have all come to understand the interdependence of our current security environment. Where one of our partners is vulnerable to terrorist exploitation, we are all put at risk.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa02">It is in our mutual interest to enhance our cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Canada views the creation of an international framework of linked mutual legal assistance treaties as an important step in the fight against international terrorism and transnational crime. Such treaties allow our respective judicial and law-enforcement agencies access to witnesses and alleged suspects of crime. Other agreements, such as memorandums of understanding, are valuable tools that allow the exchange of security, intelligence and information related to law enforcement between individual agencies.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa03">Canada also supports the Security Council's call for States to assist one another to improve their capacity to prevent and fight terrorism. Canadian federal departments and agencies have provided training, funding and expertise to more than 40 States worldwide to help combat terrorism and fight against transnational crime. We will do more.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa04">As with official development assistance, donor States need to avoid duplication and to ensure that gaps are filled in the provision of counter-terrorism capacity-building assistance. It is important to avoid increasing the administrative burden on recipient States. Canada is working with some donors to this end, but we would encourage other interested donors to join with us in exchanging information.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa05">We have always looked to the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) as a focal point for the coordination of counter-terrorism capacity-building assistance, and we hope that that will remain a priority focus for the CTC under the Spanish chairmanship. If anything, we are looking for more guidance from the CTC on priorities and on ways that Canada, as a donor and non-Council-member State, can help. The Counter-Terrorism Committee has, in our view, capably fulfilled its mandate to date, and we wish to congratulate Ambassador Greenstock on his leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa06">As <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a> notes, there is a need to strengthen controls on nuclear, chemical, biological and other potentially deadly materials. International treaties, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, are key mechanisms to help strengthen disarmament objectives and curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa07">Canada is actively participating in the negotiations on an amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. We look forward to a successful conclusion of negotiations next month. To support the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to strengthen the physical protection of nuclear facilities worldwide, the Government of Canada will be making an additional extrabudgetary voluntary contribution of $100,000 to the IAEA's nuclear security action plan. Canada believes that the IAEA has a pivotal role to play in providing assistance to those Member States that may have inappropriate or insufficient levels of physical security at nuclear facilities. We remain committed to supporting the Agency's work in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa08">Export control supplier regimes -- such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Australia Group, in which Canada is very active -- also help to ensure that materials and technology that can contribute to the spread of weapons of mass destruction do not end up in unwanted hands. In this area, an ounce of prevention has become a ton of cure.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa09">In <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>, we note the Security Council's emphasis on creating a climate of mutual tolerance and respect as an important component in a holistic approach to combating terrorism. In Canada's multicultural context, it would be impossible to talk about counter-terrorism measures without being intimately aware of the potential implications for minorities. These potential implications were in the forefront of our reflections at the time we drafted Canada's Anti-Terrorism Act. That Act also sends a clear message not just on terrorism, but also against acts of hatred and discrimination.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa10">Canada subscribes to this holistic approach, which seeks to address situations of conflict and violence as a part of the broader fight against terrorism. We believe that just and equitable societies are best equipped to prevent terrorism. Their populations are less likely to be vulnerable to terrorist exploitation. Canadians have long promoted human rights, good governance and democratic development as essential to the development of stable and secure societies. The Government of Canada is resolved to enhance cooperation with our international partners to combat terrorism.</p>

	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa01"> The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of El Salvador, on whom I now call.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg035-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lagos Pizzati</span> <span class="nation">El Salvador</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa01">I wish to begin my statement by congratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation for the way in which you are presiding over this very important United Nations organ this month, at a momentous time for the future of international relations and, in particular, for the Organization, the highest expression of multilateralism.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa02">We also congratulate Ambassador Greenstock on his presentation in his capacity as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We commend him for all that he has achieved.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa03">While we reaffirm our full support for the statement made by the representative of Peru on behalf of the Rio Group, of which we are a member, we wish to take this opportunity to offer some additional comments on an issue of great interest to each and every member of the international community by virtue of its implications and grave consequences for stability, democratic institutionality and development, as well as for our peoples' effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa04">Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations represents a global threat, the characteristics of which are so unique that they can be only addressed jointly by means of concerted and united efforts and close cooperation, which we believe should continue to be principally coordinated by the Counter-Terrorism Committee, pursuant to the mandate embodied in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa05">We wish to reaffirm that, since the adoption of that resolution, along with those subsequently adopted by the Security Council on this issue, the Government of El Salvador has taken the necessary provisions and steps at the national and subregional levels to fulfil its obligations and responsibilities under those resolutions, offering its cooperation and support at all times to the Counter-Terrorism Committee in the execution of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa06">In this respect, on 20 December 2001, the Government of El Salvador, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, presented its first report on measures adopted or to be adopted to combat international terrorism. The report was followed by the submission of two supplementary reports, one presented in June 2002 and another to be sent today to the Chairman of the Committee. Each contains responses to the comments of the Counter-Terrorism Committee regarding the first reports.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa07">Accordingly, we reaffirm once again the readiness of the Government of El Salvador to make the necessary efforts to cooperate with the Counter-Terrorism Committee in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. I would note that, in order to achieve better results to that end, we are awaiting an opportunity to meet with a member of the Committee to determine the kind of assistance that El Salvador requires to supplement and increase its capacity to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa08">El Salvador has demonstrated its commitment to the struggle against terrorism at the regional level by serving as the Chairman of the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism, which held its third regular session in San Salvador from 22 to 24 January 2003. On that occasion, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of El Salvador, Ms. María Eugenia Brizuela de Ávila, reaffirmed that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg035-bk02-pa09">"El Salvador is absolutely ready to continue to join in efforts aimed at the common objective of preventing terrorism from afflicting our civilization and way of life".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa10">At that meeting, the Committee adopted the Declaration of San Salvador on strengthening cooperation in the fight against terrorism. The Declaration urges the States of the inter-American system that have not yet done so to accede to the United Nations conventions and protocols on terrorism and other related international instruments. It also reaffirmed our commitment to bolstering cooperation among States and regional and world organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa11">I wish to inform the Council that the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador last week ratified the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism, the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the International Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, together with the additional protocols. The corresponding instruments of ratification will be deposited in the next few days. Our accession to these important instruments has closed gaps in our legislation, providing us with a legal framework that will further advance national endeavours to combat that scourge to all mankind.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa12">In conclusion, I express our appreciation to the Counter-Terrorism Committee for its work and to the Security Council for convening this open debate, which has enabled us to exchange views on the issue of combating international terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg036-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg036-bk01-pa01"> I now call on the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee to address some of the problems and questions that have been raised in the debate.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg036-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa01">I will not take long. I wish first to thank Member States for their interventions this morning, which have been interesting and very positive, and to express appreciation to them also for the tremendous amount of hard work that is going into the whole process of the interaction between the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and Member States. What they are doing in their capitals and what they are doing in their delegations matters a tremendous amount to them, and it is nearly all being done very well.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa02">I think there is a sense from this morning of overall support and momentum from Member States, which is extremely important to the CTC. Members of that Committee are very conscious that we have to continue to earn it in the future, but it is vital to us.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa03">I think it was the representative of Fiji who talked about the many threads of our activity in this very complex operation against a nasty threat. In the Committee, we have become increasingly conscious that we have to create a global network. It has to be pervasive and comprehensive, and that, increasingly, is what we are trying to do. I think it is reflected very well in the declaration contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>. I think it is reflected in the CTC's response to that, which -- although it looks quite bureaucratic in the follow-up paper that we have put round behind my remarks this morning -- is very comprehensive and becoming increasingly operational. I think Member States are appreciating that.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa04">I want to assure Members of the United Nations that, in that follow-up -- I think it was the representatives of Egypt and South Africa who referred to this point -- we will take Member States on their merits. There are different capacities and different speeds of work that are possible. So long as every Member State is working to its own full capacity, then it has a willing partner in the Counter-Terrorism Committee. There was an enormous amount of comment -- a very encouraging amount of comment -- on the regional activity that is going on. Paragraph 5 of the declaration annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a> says, "States should assist each other to improve their capacity", and States are beginning to do that.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa05">I want to be invidious for a moment and say that, in my personal view, the Organization of American States is still, in the lead amongst regional organizations for its cohesiveness and for the detail that it is putting into its programmes. But all the regional organizations are way ahead of where they were 18 months ago. I think that that is a very encouraging development. They realize as organizations and as individual States that it is in their interest to keep terrorism out. There are deep economic, social and political disadvantages in allowing terrorism to take place or to grow on one' s territory.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa06">I think that it was South Africa, again, that brought out very clearly the importance of the collective in achieving the interests of each Member State. The fact that that is realized is very valuable. There is a growth of machinery in these organizations. There is a growth of bilateral and multilateral exchange activity and operational coordination. There is a growth of seminaring and conferencing. There is a growth of the exchange of best practice. All of this is tremendously valuable.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa07">I think that it was Fiji that talked also about the areas of vulnerability. There is a growing realization in all States that there are gaps in their performance and in their makeup against terrorism about which they are learning from participation in the collective activity. I hope that our conference on 7 March will be not just a collection of written and oral information handouts but also an exchange on how these points of vulnerability can most easily be filled by action learned from best practice elsewhere.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa08">My thanks go also to those States that are contributing to the assistance programmes and indeed to the international organizations as well. The European Union is coming up fast now on this front, but the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada, in addition to member States of the European Union, have all made clear how much they are putting into, particularly, their own regions.. Yes, this needs prioritization. And yes, the CTC will help -- Canada mentioned this -- with developing priorities for the assistance programme. It is something that Ambassador Ward is working on.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa09">Some mention should also be made of the connections with international organized crime and weapons of mass destruction. The Committee is going to get further into this in the near future, but up to, I think, 10 Member States mentioned this this morning. It is my hope -- I hope it is not a dream -- that the structures that we are beginning to put into place for counter-terrorism in the global network will also prove valuable in the activity against other forms of international organized crime and eventually in providing a much more cohesive and effective structure for keeping weapons of mass destruction out of the wrong hands.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa10">The requests for greater proactivity, transparency and help with guidelines that we heard this morning -- Israel and Liechtenstein touched on those points -- are being listened to by the Committee. I think that we must be careful as a Committee not to try to do everything ourselves. The right professional organizations should be the ones calling for conferences and operational action on civil aviation, shipping, other forms of communication, customs work and arms control. There are much better bodies than the CTC to do that. But we will be a switchboard for making sure that this activity happens.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa11">As for guidelines on compliance, which was Liechtenstein' s point, the fundamental guideline is the text of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We will not stop advocating that. But I think that the 7 March meeting will usefully get into global standards as guidelines in each of the main areas. Delegations will find that as the published material of the Committee and its sister organizations increases, that corpus of written work will provide an extremely useful set of guidelines and information to Member States as they devise their own national programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa12">I think that after a further period of time -- and we will talk about this in the future -- the Committee, under my successor, Ambassador Arias, will eventually need to develop into a more professional body. I think that we should start brainstorming on that, and we will do it over the coming period.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa13">I end with warm thanks to you, Mr. President, for organizing this meeting, to the Committee for its continued hard work and increasing professionalism, to our excellent body of experts and to our Secretariat help, which is, as we said this morning, increasing in effectiveness and experience all the time.</p>
	<p id="pg036-bk02-pa14">I think that we have now discussed, analysed and planned enough. The next period will be for action.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg037-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg037-bk01-pa01">I thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Ambassador Greenstock, for his clarifications.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg037-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa01">It is difficult for anybody to take the floor after Ambassador Greenstock' s valuable remarks. However, the statement by the representative of Israel makes it hard for me not to say a few words.</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa02">Syria has always been proud of having been among the first countries to combat terrorism, and of having been successful in doing so. It is also very proud that it cooperates with all countries of the world -- in the North, South, East and West -- to combat and eliminate terrorism. High-level officials in more than one country have affirmed that Syria' s cooperation with them in combating terrorism has saved lives.</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa03">The countries of the world elected Syria almost unanimously to membership of the Security Council, in appreciation of Syria' s role in international political life and in the Middle East. For some 14 months, Syria has done everything possible to enhance the work of the Council, especially in combating terrorism. States members of the Security Council are well aware of Syria' s effective and rich contribution in fighting terrorism. Council members and other States Members of the United Nations, contrary to allegations by the representative of Israel, know full well the effective role that Syria plays in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa04">Let me caution that the greatest danger to the international campaign against terrorism is the Israeli terrorist approach to combating terrorism. It appears that the representative of Israel' s ignorance of the principles and methods of international action, of Security Council debate, of how the Council discusses the items before it and of the work of its subsidiary bodies has blinded him to the truth. He thus resorted to cheap tricks when we were discussing such a serious issue in the work of the Council. Does the representative of Israel seriously believe that he can mislead Council members and the international community? I do not believe so.</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa05">Palestinians in Syria, about whom the representative of Israel spoke, estimated to number more than 400,000, are the victims of Israeli terrorism. The entire world sees and hears about Israeli terrorist practices. In 1948, Israel was founded on terrorist organizations. The records of the United Kingdom Foreign Office are replete with evidence of that. The killing of Count Bernadotte, the United Nations peace mediator, at the hands of Israeli terrorist gangs is well known. Recently, United Nations officials have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa06">It appears that Israel cannot understand that occupation is terrorism. It has killed more than 2,180 Palestinians during the past two years alone. Thirty Palestinians have been killed in the past day and a half -- that is one Palestinian killed every hour. An entire army is practising terrorism. What does it mean consistently to demolish the houses of Palestinians, throwing thousands of innocent children into the rain, snow and cold of the winter? What does it mean to demolish a house yesterday while four people were still living in it -- killing all of them? Is not that terrorism?</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa07">The problem is that Israel thinks only about its own children, its settlements and its occupation and about the need to maintain that occupation. The representative of Israel referred to the Israeli occupation soldiers who escort the poor Israeli children to their schools. But Palestinian children are being killed in cold blood every single day, with Israeli tanks at their doors to stop them from going to school. But killing them is not enough. According to Israeli logic, they are not human beings.</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa08">A four-month-old child, Iman Hajjo, was killed when four bullets penetrated her little head, shattering it completely. We all watched as the child Mohamed al-Durra was killed by the Israeli occupation forces. Is that life or death? Is not that terrorism?</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa09">Everybody has the right to talk about terrorism except Israel; Israel is the symbol and embodiment of terrorism. Israel must stop its occupation of our territory; it must stop its settlers; it must stop violating our rights. We have said before and will say again that occupation is terrorism -- it is the apex of terrorism. Occupation is occupation, and occupation is terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa10">We support the fight of all people against occupation, even though some have claimed that such fights constitute terrorism. Let me reaffirm that Syria will continue its close cooperation with all countries to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and it will make every effort to support the Counter-Terrorism Committee with a view to fully implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in all its aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg037-bk02-pa11">I would like to express my gratitude to Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock for all of his efforts as Chairman of the Committee. We promise the next Chairman of the Committee -- our neighbour in the Council, Ambassador Arias, Permanent Representative of Spain -- that we will continue that cooperation.</p>
