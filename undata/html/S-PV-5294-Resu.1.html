<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rogachev</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">In the five years since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, we have managed to accomplish a great deal. We note with satisfaction that the range of issues under discussion today are being given greater attention not only in the Security Council, but also within the framework of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions, particularly the Commission on the Status of Women. The process of gender mainstreaming is being pursued in all aspects of United Nations activities. Useful recommendations in this area were made by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change (<a href="../pdf/A-59-565.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/565</a>)and in the report of the Secretary-General entitled "In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all" (<a href="../pdf/A-59-2005.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/2005</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Nevertheless, there is still much to be done. A particularly difficult situation continues to prevail on the African continent, where the status of women has become dramatic in some cases. That shows that we need to make even greater efforts to achieve the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We have scarcely exhausted the resolution's potential as an important guide in defining the roles of women in conflict prevention and settlement and in post-conflict reconstruction. That is made particularly clear by States' commitment to the full and effective implementation of the resolution, as reaffirmed in the outcome document (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/1</a></i>) of the 2005 summit.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">In a so-called era of fulfilling commitments, we need to make practical use of the resolution's provisions by establishing equal opportunity for active participation by women in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security and by enhancing women's role in decision-making. We believe that, in the near future, gender perspectives must be given their appropriate place in the activities of the Peacebuilding Commission, whose mandate should be elaborated with a view to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. On the whole, the centre of activities in this area should be shifted from the Security Council to specific everyday situations in international life. Of course, reliable results will be achieved only in the context of naturally developing processes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">A good basis for mobilizing the efforts of United Nations agencies is being established through the system-wide action plan for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, set out in the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a>). We welcome the plan's detailed identification of concrete activities that will enable us to focus the Organization's activities on implementing a system-wide strategy for dealing with problems in the area of women and peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">We note the opportunities that the plan provides for strengthening inter-agency coordination and structural accountability. In that connection, it is important that gender mainstreaming in the field not be merely a declared intention, but rather that it produce concrete results that protect and enhance the situation of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations. We also welcome the intention of the Secretary-General, as reflected in his report on the implementation of the summit outcome, to ensure policies of zero tolerance with regard to sexual exploitation by United Nations personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">Bearing in mind that women are able to play and are already playing a greater role in all aspects of conflict prevention and settlement, we support the elaboration of a strategy to ensure full participation by women in peace negotiations and in elections. In the context of post-conflict reconstruction, we must make greater use of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women as an essential document.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">Moreover, we should devote greater attention to gender mainstreaming in the work of United Nations programmes and funds aimed at overcoming poverty in post-conflict situations. We are thinking in particular of strategies for enhancing women's participation in decision-making on social and economic issues and in the establishment of national frameworks for achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">In conclusion, I should like to reaffirm our conviction that the issue of women's participation in peace processes will receive comprehensive and priority consideration in the bodies of the United Nations system.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Banzon</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">First, permit me to join previous speakers in thanking the Government of Romania for convening this important open debate. Through you, Mr. President, I should also to thank our speakers today for their comprehensive presentations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The short video presentation showed us the multiplier effect that results from the protection and empowerment of women as active agents of peace and as effective peacebuilders. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> is not merely a resolution; it is a movement wherein women's participation in securing peace has been acknowledged as a critical factor of success in conflict prevention and resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">There is still a huge gap when it comes to making women part of peacebuilding in the public and official sense. We need to make the flesh and spirit of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> tangible on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">In the Philippines, the gender dimension of conflict is being addressed, particularly in peace negotiations and in peace and development efforts. To ensure that the voices of women are heard, the Government's peace panels included two women in the core negotiating team. In the southern part of the country, the Mindanao Commission on Women has formulated a Mindanao women's position paper on the peace agreement between the Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Recently, women leaders in Mindanao have been pursuing projects to empower the women of southern Philippines to be channels for respect for cultural diversity and for the building of a more inclusive Mindanao society.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">The Philippines framework for dealing with the issue of women and conflict covers three areas: first, ensuring the protection of women's human rights by addressing violence against women, by providing health services and by promoting human rights education; secondly, promoting economic empowerment by urgently addressing the lack of access to water, electricity and other basic needs, as well as by stimulating economic opportunities for women; and thirdly, fostering effective governance by promoting awareness of gender and peace concerns among local Government units and by improving women's participation in decision-making processes.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">In short, our fundamental strategy for implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> lies in enabling more women to systematically participate in conflict prevention, management and resolution and in post-conflict peacebuilding, while at the same time rehabilitating their communities and ensuring basic services and livelihoods. The Philippines ensures the full participation of women in local peace processes by building capacities and mobilizing peace constituencies. For example, women in indigenous communities are serving as intermediaries in local peace dialogues and as mediators in the restoration of broken peace pacts. They are also engaged in mobilizing community participation in the formulation of ancestral-domain development plans and reconciliation processes.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">We would also like to add that the Philippines is particularly encouraged to note the findings of a recent national survey on the Filipino people's perception of women as peacemakers. A principal finding of the survey is that a majority of Filipinos agree with the statement "A successful peace process in Mindanao needs the participation of women along with men". The same statistical study also shows that both Filipino men and women nationwide share the same strong advocacy of women's representation in Government peace panels. Also interesting is the conclusion that over half of the nationwide sample agrees that a woman has more talent than a man for finding a way to settle a conflict without resorting to violence.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">The Philippines welcomes the establishment of a United Nations system-wide action plan to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, which has been explained comprehensively by Ms. Mayanja. We note that many of the components of that action plan are not entirely new and have already been operational for some time. What is new about the plan, however, is the orchestration of all the actions towards realizing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">1325 (2000)</a>. The action plan is valuable not only in providing a coherent picture of our efforts to achieve the resolution's goals, but also in pinpointing areas that we might have missed and functions that could be overlapping. The system-wide action plan would therefore contribute much to the efficiency and accountability of the United Nations system on gender mainstreaming in the field of peace and conflict resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">The Philippines believes that the system-wide action plan is but a means to an end. Member States, led by Security Council members, must be conscious of the critical transition from the gains of gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping missions to the achievement of sustainable capacities at the local level. The action plan must therefore function as a vehicle to transplant investments in gender mainstreaming long after the peace missions have dissolved. It would therefore be important for the United Nations field presence to be in close contact with national and local authorities, as well as with local non-governmental organizations, to ensure that gender mainstreaming successes filter through to the most basic governance and civil structures. In that regard, we were happy to hear Mr. Guéhenno report that gender units in peacekeeping operations have been supporting the capacity development of national counterparts in Government and non-governmental sectors.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">As developments on the ground continue to be fluid, the Philippines would like to see the action plan used also as a tool for gathering accurate information on the status of women in conflict areas, including the scope and gravity of gender-based violence and progress on the empowerment of women in the area of peace and security. Certainly, that information would serve to guide the Council on the way forward in implementation and monitoring. The action plan should also remain responsive to changes in the environment and should be updated, as necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, the Philippines looks forward to the establishment of the proposed peacebuilding commission; <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> should be among the basic pillars of its work. Essential to the work of the peacebuilding commission would be its coordination with civil society, including women's organizations, both at the Headquarters level and at the country level.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa12">The current state of the restructuring and rationalizing of the organization and work of the United Nations presents a rare opportunity to boost the work of mainstreaming gender in peace efforts. The Philippines will continue to contribute to the work of strengthening the gender perspective in all stages of the peacebuilding process.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I should now like to make a statement in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">I should indicate from the outset that Romania fully aligns itself with the statement that was made this morning by the British Ambassador on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Within the United Nations system and elsewhere, there is growing international consensus that women's participation in conflict prevention and peace processes is a matter of having a solid understanding of and healthy perspective on the issue. We are told and we say that the role of women in decision-making is important and legitimate, serves the cause of peace, and fosters reconstruction and reconciliation. It is generally argued that women's empowerment would ensure that those who are frequently the most vulnerable play a role in the transformation and rebuilding of their societies.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">That is an assumption that needs challenging. Women should be acknowledged as having a valuable contribution to make to their societies and to international relations not because of their high potential as victims, but because they are recognized as valuable and skilful resources, able to make a difference and bring added value to peace processes in all parts of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> marked, in our view, our acceptance and endorsement of a different mindset about women in peace and security. We often predetermine policies and decisions, categorizing women as vulnerable beings and identifying them primarily as likely victims. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, however, recognizes the true dimension of women's capabilities to contribute to and to be equal partners with men in peace processes and to contribute substantially to the development of their societies.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">We have vivid illustrations of those facts. Women fight wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, contribute to post-conflict reconstruction in Kosovo and Bosnia, are excellent peacekeepers in Africa, act as devoted parliamentarians, and make decisions in governmental structures in Rwanda, Uganda and Eritrea.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">From the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> onwards, this Council -- and the entire United Nations system, we should like to believe -- have acted towards and given support to a wider and more balanced presence of women in peace and security. The participation of women in conflict prevention and resolution is no longer narrowly defined as a matter of gender equality and no longer confined to a perspective of human rights, democratic practices or social justice. It is a matter of a whole new mentality acknowledging that women embody political representation at all levels and in all societies and have the necessary knowledge, expertise and resources to participate in the advancement of their societies through their active contributions to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">At this point, we wish to stress our view that the role of women as agents of development and peace should transcend boundaries and cultures. Engaging women in national and international affairs does not mean changing one's particular system of values. It is within the richness of each particular system that gender perspectives should be sought, put in the spotlight and mainstreamed into politics and policies. States, the United Nations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations must work together in order to close the gap that still exists between discourse and the diplomatic perspective, on the one hand, and the reality on the ground, on the other.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa09">A starting point in that direction is the recent report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security, particularly the system-wide action plan for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We express our appreciation to the Secretariat for such a unique and complex work, which we believe is a useful tool and framework of action for gender mainstreaming in all activities being carried out by the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa10">The continued implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> calls for ongoing scrutiny at the national and international levels of all forms of violence against and abuse of women in conflict or post-conflict situations by combatants or United Nations peacekeeping personnel, as well as of trafficking in human beings, women refugees and internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa11">In Romania, with the valuable help and support of the United Nations Population Fund, this October organized an international conference on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. The conference in Bucharest brought together participants from Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Zambia, Palestine, Timor-Leste, Thailand, the Sudan and Kosovo. They discussed the value of the resolution and how to move forward, share experiences and methodologies for its implementation and, most important, how to narrow the gap between the text's provisions and reality on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa12">It is indeed true that, even when women are guaranteed their civil and political rights by a network of institutions and norms, legal stipulations, even when just and unambiguous, cannot by themselves ensure gender equity in the diversity of social and political life. Empowering women is about overcoming prejudice and marginalization and marshalling political will to recognize them as resourceful contributors to decision-making. It is Romania's position that we should all shift our approach to women and peace and security to one that views their participation as the rule rather than the exception. We should also move from words to action and, last but not least, treat women as full partners rather than as a special category.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa13">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa14">I now give the floor to Ms. Elsie-Bernadette Onubogu, Gender Adviser of the Commonwealth Secretariat.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Onubogu</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01"> I would like to congratulate the delegation of Romania on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council. I should also like to express our gratitude for the holding of this meeting and for the opportunity to address the Council. I would also like to extend to the Council the greetings of to The Right Honourable Don McKinnon, Commonwealth Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Since 2000, the Commonwealth has been working with member countries to implement the historic <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1235(2000).pdf" class="nolink">resolution 1235 (2000)</a>, particularly by strengthening its programme of work on gender, democracy, peace and conflict through the Commonwealth's new Plan of Action for Gender Equality 2005-2015.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The Commonwealth's 53 member States straddle nearly every continent in seeking to promote peace, strong democracies, good governance, gender equality and sustainable development. Within those fundamental values, the Commonwealth's comparative advantage lies in upholding democracy and developing and encouraging a stronger democratic culture within member countries, as evidence has shown that countries with strong democracies are less likely to experience conflict. In that connection, Mr. McKinnon has noted that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg005-bk01-pa04">"when women and men are enabled to play their full part in the future of their country, when there is real debate about issues of collective concern -- about education, health care, employment, governance, social justice -- extremist and violent ideologies are less likely to hold sway".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Broadly speaking, the Commonwealth has a five-pronged approach to conflict prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding. It includes the following elements.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The first relates to strengthening democracies. The Commonwealth works with member States to build the necessary capacity for democratic elections and governance systems and to ensure that member countries seek to achieve representative democracies that include women, men, young persons and politically marginalized groups. The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth appoints election observers and monitors to support elections in member States. They report on the conduct of elections in countries such as Cameroon, Papua New Guinea, Malawi, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and a number of others. In the Commonwealth we reaffirm our conviction that gender equality is a fundamental premise in achieving representative democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">The second element is increased participation and representation of women at all levels. Commonwealth ministers for women and gender affairs have adopted a new Plan of Action for Gender Equality. In the Plan of Action the ministers recalled the 1991 Harare Declaration, which was adopted by Commonwealth heads of Government and urged member States to promote gender equality as a fundamental principle of democracy, good governance and peace both within the Commonwealth and throughout the world. In furtherance of those objectives, efforts are under way to establish a regional leadership training institute for Caribbean women in politics, an undertaking that was the result of a workshop organized by the Commonwealth secretariat and other partners.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">It is envisaged that such initiatives will promote women's increased participation and representation in decision-making at all levels. Women's representation and participation is critical because, for women to be able to influence policies and decisions that affect their lives and those of their societies, especially in conflict and post-conflict situations, their political, social, cultural and economic empowerment through access to decision-making must form part of the democratic ideal.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">To further promote women's representation, the Commonwealth Secretary-General regularly appoints special envoys to countries to monitor developments in member States that are likely to result in conflict. Such envoys work with member countries to carry out dialogue and prevent conflicts before they occur. Some women envoys have been appointed in that regard, to countries such as Cameroon. However, there is room for more participation by women.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">The third element relates to developing a culture of peace through peace education. Along with other partners, the Commonwealth is actively engaged in the development of peace education curriculums especially aimed at young persons, in countries such as Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and Uganda.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">The fourth is documentation and information-sharing and good practices. As part of our continuing effort to provide information and document good practices, the Commonwealth has published a new book entitled <i>Gender Mainstreaming in Conflict Transformation: Building Sustainable Peace</i>. The book is a body of advocacy, capacity-building and policy tools that is intended to contribute to the why and how of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and to peacebuilding throughout the world.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">The fifth element concerns partnerships. In recognition of the need for collective action, the outcome document of the Millennium Summit (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-2.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 55/2</a></i>) outlined the responsibility to protect. It thus called on Member States and the international community to ensure the protection of civilians, in particular women and children, in conflict and post-conflict environments.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa13">Along with our strong constituents at the country level, we are working in collaboration with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and member Governments to address some of the challenges highlighted in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> related to enhancing gender awareness on the part of troops.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa14">In conclusion, the Commonwealth recognizes that sustainable peace, gender equality and development are mutually reinforcing and can only be achieved when women and men adhere to the principles of representative democracy, which allow for dialogue and collective action from all citizens and address their concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa15">Five years on, our collective responsibility to protect, as highlighted by the outcome document, must not be ignored. We must take all necessary steps to effectively address the challenges of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, in particular as regards the protection of the rights of women and children and their participation and representation in all phases of conflict, including prevention, resolution, peacekeeping, reconstruction and peacebuilding. Only when women's concerns and contributions are integrated into those processes will we truly give meaning to that landmark resolution.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lidén</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01"> The United Nations system has undertaken commendable efforts in developing a comprehensive action plan to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council 1325 (2000)</a>. But Member States also have a responsibility. That was stressed in the statement made this morning by the representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union (EU). Sweden fully aligns itself with that statement. Let me just touch upon three additional aspects of that responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">First and foremost, we have a responsibility as Members of the United Nations. As such, we need to deliver on our commitments and promises. We must both contribute more women to peace operations and reinforce the preparedness and awareness of our contingents, staff and experts. We have to demonstrate in the strongest possible ways that sexual exploitation and abuse are completely unacceptable. And when faced with a report without a gender equality perspective, we should ask for additional information. To meet some of those challenges, the Swedish partnership project Genderforce has been initiated. Bringing together relevant Government agencies and organizations, that multi-annual project focuses on integrating <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> into all phases of a peace operation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">Secondly, we have a responsibility as members of regional organizations. As their role in peace operations increases, so should their responsibilities. The representative of the United Kingdom has told us what the EU and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are doing to live up to their responsibilities. We are pleased to have contributed to that. But more action is needed, including more sharing of experiences and good practices among regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">Thirdly, we have a responsibility ourselves to provide ideas and good practices, not only to ask for reports and proposals from others. A number of gaps are identified in the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a>). I would like to share a few ideas on how some of them could potentially be addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">First, threats to women's security prevent women from being actors. In August this year, the Swedish Government, together with the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the International Law Association consortium hosted a gender justice partners meeting. The report of that meeting has been circulated as a United Nations document. It contains practical recommendations on how to integrate a gender equality perspective in post-conflict societies and thus to enhance the security and participation of women. We are committed to following up that process, in cooperation with the Republic of South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">Secondly, both the participation and protection of women would benefit from a Peacebuilding Commission with a clear and integrated gender perspective. The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, together with 14 colleagues, has presented the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly with specific ideas on how to integrate a gender-equality perspective in the design and work of the Commission and its support offices. That continues to be a priority for Sweden and for the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">Thirdly, based on its own experience in the field, and in order to meet the changing demands of multifunctional peace operations, Sweden has put forward the idea of civilian observers. In the transitional phase of a mission -- when, for instance, expertise in areas such as elections and human rights is needed -- civilian personnel could be phased into military observer teams. Additional competences could be incorporated, and the mission would thus be genuinely multifunctional at the field level as well. Such a new category of seconded civilian personnel could significantly increase the number of female mission members at the field level, where military observer teams very often constitute the only presence of a peace mission.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">Fourthly, special representatives, special envoys and other emissaries involved in peace negotiations should have firm guidelines from the Secretary-General to enhance women's participation in peace processes and transitional structures. Any reason for failure to succeed should be reported on. Such benchmarks could really make a difference. We need only compare the impressive level of female participation in the parliament of Afghanistan with the much poorer results in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That does not reflect local conditions. Rather, it is the result of a determined policy on the part of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">In order to shoulder our responsibilities at the national level, an inter-ministerial working group is now finalizing a Swedish action plan in order to intensify our implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. Work is being -- and will continue to be -- carried out in cooperation with Government agencies, as well as with civil society. We look forward to sharing good practices with States and organizations in the process of developing or implementing their plans, methods and tools. Only by cooperating will we be able to ensure that decisions and ambitions will improve the daily lives of women and men, girls and boys. We cannot afford to settle for less.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Asmady</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Let me begin by expressing my delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts to establish a system-wide action plan for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, as set out in his report on women and peace and security (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a></i>). Not only will the report ensure better coordination and the provision of more efficient support to Member States and other actors in implementing the resolution at the national and regional levels, but it will also strengthen the commitment and accountability of the United Nations at the highest level.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Indonesia agrees that it is important -- as underlined in the 2005 World Summit Outcome -- to integrate a gender perspective into all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security and to ensure equal opportunities for women to be fully involved in peace processes, as well as to increase their role in decision-making at all levels. In Indonesia, the entry into force of Law No. 12 of 2003 on general elections provides a solid foundation for women's participation in the decision-making process. The law seeks to guarantee that women make up at least 30 per cent of those individuals contesting national and regional parliamentary elections. In doing so, it creates an awareness of gender equality in power and decision-making.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">As a major contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions, Indonesia is of the view that training, gender-sensitization and capacity-building for uniformed personnel and civilian police are essential for effective United Nations peacemaking, peacebuilding and peacekeeping missions. Law No. 3 of 2002 reaffirmed the need for a new peace paradigm which will inculcate in the Indonesian army a deep commitment to democracy, human rights and the protection of the environment. Those principles have become an integral part of the basic curriculums of military schools and other military training activities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">My delegation strongly believes that, together with the 12 areas of action, gender mainstreaming must have an impact, at all levels, on those responsible for the implementation of the action plan. Indonesia therefore fully agrees that there is a need to strengthen the commitment of senior and top managers to institutionalize gender mainstreaming by means of developing effective monitoring, reporting and accountability mechanisms. In this connection, Indonesia welcomes the efforts of the United Nations specialized agencies that have put in place improved accountability systems to ensure that senior management and staff at all levels undertake efforts to achieve gender mainstreaming in their work.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">In order to facilitate implementation, there should be increased efforts to address serious persistent challenges, including overlapping activities; underdeveloped monitoring, reporting and accountability mechanisms; the inadequate utilization of gender specialists; and insufficient capacity for gender analysis. It is my delegation's fervent hope that the action plan will be used as a tool for better coordination and the enhancing of synergies within the United Nations system, so that such challenges can be properly addressed as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">Indonesia also agrees with the Secretary-General's recommendation to enhance inter-agency cooperation in the field, including through United Nations country teams, gender theme groups and gender advisers and units and to improve cooperation with national Governments, national machineries for the advancement of women and the promotion of gender equality, and civil society. However, such efforts should focus on the capacity-building of national machinery, particularly in the area of raising awareness for gender mainstreaming and equality through training, advocacy and socialization, targeting various executive and legislative authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, Indonesia is of the view that establishing time lines for the action plan will improve the accuracy of and coordination among concerned United Nations agencies, as well as leading to the enhancement of accountability. It is Indonesia's keen hope that significant progress towards the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> will be achieved beyond 2007 and that women will be able to live more secure and productive lives and fully enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to Mr. Anders B. Johnsson, Secretary General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Johnsson</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01"> I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having given the Inter-Parliamentary Union the opportunity to address the Security Council on this very important issue.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">Before making my statement, I would like to convey to the Council the greetings of Mr. Pier Ferdinando Casini, Speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, who has just been elected President of our organization for a three-year term and who will be coming to New York early next week for the annual parliamentary hearing at the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Women and children suffer the most severe consequences of conflicts that they themselves do not instigate. All of us, therefore, have a responsibility to work in support of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. At a recent IPU Assembly, members of parliament reviewed the situation and drew up an impressive list of actions that they can and do promote in parliaments and elsewhere in support of that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">Fittingly, the IPU -- as the world organization of parliaments -- addresses the issue of women's participation in peace processes from a parliamentary perspective. Parliaments have a fundamental role to play in peace and reconciliation processes and in the implementation of peace agreements. The very existence of a strong and effective parliament is itself an essential component of any solution to conflict and in the building of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">Women must be full and equal participants in political processes. This is not only a question of rights -- of equality in society -- but also an issue of substance. Surveys we have undertaken clearly demonstrate the fact that many women have a keen awareness of social issues that many men lack. They have a better understanding of specific gender issues, particularly violations of the rights of women during conflict, which need to be addressed in peace processes.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">Hence, these peace processes can be truly effective and efficient only to the extent that both women and men participate in them. Yet this is certainly not the case today. In parliaments, for example, women make up only, on average, 16 per cent of the membership.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">It is therefore encouraging that the presence of women members in parliament in many post-conflict countries has shown a tendency to increase markedly after the conflict, invariably resulting in figures for women members of parliament that are well above the world average. The majority of those countries rank among the top 30 in the world.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">Rwanda's proportion has climbed from 17 per cent before the conflict to 49 per cent today. It has the highest relative score of any country. Burundi surged from 9 percent to 30 per cent today and went on to elect a woman as Speaker of Parliament. Mozambique more than doubled, from 16 per cent to 35 per cent. Sierra Leone was at 1 per cent before the conflict started; today, 14 per cent of parliamentarians are women.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">What sets these countries apart? We believe it is the fact that they have approached the peace process as an opportunity to instigate real change.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Countries like Rwanda and Burundi have given gender equality issues special attention and consideration from the very beginning of the peace process. They have actually written these issues into their constitutions. They have established transitional national assemblies with greater participation by women and have introduced quotas at the institutional level. They have made sure that women receive leadership training to run for election. The results speak volumes as to what countries should do when experiencing similar situations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">The IPU is present in many post-conflict countries. Our efforts include working with women, helping them to develop their leadership skills and facilitating their work, both as candidates and subsequently as members of parliament.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa12">We also seek to ensure that the institution of parliament is able to address gender issues, and we do so by raising awareness of these issues among women and men both.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa13">Ensuring effective oversight is one key function of parliament, and it includes oversight of the security forces. There are many ways in which parliament can and should exercise its oversight function in the field of security, and we are now working with many parliaments to assist them in introducing a gender perspective on security policy.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa14">We are also assisting parliaments in analysing the national budget from a gender perspective. This is particularly valuable when consolidating peace and making sure that the national budget is allocated in a manner that allows for the implementation of peace agreements, including those components that may be of particular importance to women.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa15">The lessons we have learned from our fieldwork, from parliamentary diplomacy and from our political debates is that we must treat these peace processes as a continuum extending far beyond the final conclusion of an agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa16">We must take a long-term approach to ensure that peace is consolidated and not subjected to renewed threats. We must also ensure that gender issues are addressed from the very beginning of the peace process and that women are included among those who negotiate peace agreements. We have seen the value of transitional assemblies as a vehicle for improvement and, of course, an elected parliament is essential. It is important that the gender composition of such assemblies be discussed early on as well.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa17">There is a need to focus on these institutions, to give them the means they require to become effective, to sensitize men to gender issues, and to sustain this effort over a long period of time.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa18">Let me conclude these remarks by reminding members of the Security Council of the declaration that 150 speakers of parliament adopted here at the United Nations last month. In that declaration, they pledge their support to the United Nations and United Nations reform. They called for a strategic partnership between the organization that I represent here today, the IPU, and the United Nations, with more substantive interaction and coordination between the two organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa19">Specifically, they encourage the United Nations to avail itself more frequently of the political and technical expertise that the IPU, together with its member parliaments, can provide, particularly in areas relating to post-conflict institution-building. The creation of a new Peacebuilding Commission at the United Nations offers an important opportunity to do so. We look forward to working closely with the United Nations in turning this vision into reality.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Namibia, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Andjaba</span> <span class="nation">Namibia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) member States Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and my own country, Namibia.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">Let me thank the panellists for their informative and illuminating introductory presentations this morning. We welcome the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a>) on women and peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">I am delighted that it was during Namibia's presidency of the Security Council in October 2000 that an open debate and discussions were initiated which culminated in the adoption of this landmark resolution -- <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> -- which we have the honour of reviewing today. This five-year review presents us with an opportunity to pause and evaluate the progress we have made thus far in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. It is our fervent belief that this event will add the desired impetus to our commitment to fully realize all the goals and objectives of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We are thus gratified by the efforts undertaken within the United Nations to develop a system-wide action plan to implement this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The action plan has provided us with a framework within which progress on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> can be coordinated, monitored and evaluated. It is important that the action plan not reinvent the wheel but rather build on the achievements already made. In that regard, we welcome the recommendation to review the adequacy of existing operational tools, guidelines and manuals for gender mainstreaming.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">We further note with appreciation the fact that the action plan has taken into account the capacity of women in the areas of peacemaking and peacebuilding. Women's groups, especially those in the vicinity of conflict areas, have an important role to play, especially during the reconciliation, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes. Local expertise needs to be fully utilized in all phases of conflict resolution and peacebuilding.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">However, we note with concern that, although there has been some progress in the reporting of gender issues in the Secretary-General's reports as well as in the work of the Security Council, gaps in reporting on gender and women's issues continues to exist. Thus, there is a need to critically examine the reasons behind the underreporting of gender and women's issues and to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation. We know that in many cases the non-inclusion of gender aspects is a result of inadequate capacity rather than reluctance. We would therefore like to stress that continuous capacity-building on gender analysis skills both for staff and for stakeholders is crucial for successful implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">We call for closer collaboration between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations such as the African Union, the Southern African Development Community and the Economic Community of West African States, to mention but a few. However, that will require capacity-building in terms of technical, human and financial resources. We therefore call upon the United Nations system to assist in building the capacities of those organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome document of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly called for women's participation to be equal to that of men and for their full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">An area of concern to us is the continued low representation of women in all phases of the peacebuilding process. Despite the disproportionate impact of conflict on women, they continue to hold their families and communities together and often undertake initiatives across warring factions under extremely difficult conditions. When involved, they bring their experiences into formal peace processes. Thus, it is imperative that they be included in peacebuilding processes at all levels. It is unfortunate that, more often than not, the efforts of women are insufficiently recognized and supported, both politically and financially. As a result, women's rights are rarely integrated into peace agreements or in the structures supporting post-conflict reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">We therefore urge that the role of women in those processes be built into the peace agreements from the very beginning. The challenge before us is how to increase the number of women in all phases and at all levels of peace processes. Men need to be sensitized on the positive contributions that women can bring to the negotiating table. Both the United Nations system and Member States must make deliberate efforts to identify and support women's participation in peace processes. The inadequate representation of women in decision-making is not a phenomenon unique to peacebuilding processes. Rather, it extends to all other areas. In that regard, we urge Member States and the organizations of the United Nations system, within their respective mandates, to address the barriers women face in moving into decision-making positions.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission has presented us with an opportunity to ensure that gender is integrated into the design and work of the Commission. We must formulate concrete strategies, actions and programmes in a consistent and effective manner to advance the role of women in the area of peace and security. We should ensure the effective participation of women in the Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa12">SADC condemns the use of sexual and gender-based violence against women and children as a weapon of war and also condemns widespread violations of their human rights. We call upon all parties involved in conflicts to respect international humanitarian law and to ensure the protection of women and children.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa13">Furthermore, the continuing sexual exploitation and abuse perpetrated against women and girls by some United Nations peacekeepers and other personnel is of great concern to us. We urge the accelerated implementation of the Secretary-General's recommendations on sexual exploitation and abuse. Further, we urge troop- and police-contributing countries to take punitive actions against those involved in acts of sexual exploitation and abuse.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa14">Finally, let me reaffirm SADC's commitment to the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Iceland.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hannesson</span> <span class="nation">Iceland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">Allow me, first, to express the satisfaction of my delegation, as a non-member of the Council, at being able to discuss the issue of women and peace and security in an open meeting on the fifth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. We wish, in particular, to thank the special panellists who spoke to the Council earlier and added valuable points of view to our deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">At the outset, my Government would like to express its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his report on women and peace and security, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/636</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> was a groundbreaking step forward in reaffirming the importance of the equal participation and the direct involvement of women in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, as many have said before me. By its adoption, it was finally recognized that women have an important role to play in peace processes and in achieving sustainable peace in conflict regions. That landmark resolution is a challenge to us all, for it requires a fundamental change in procedure, delivery, attitudes and habits.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">Since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, considerable attention has been paid to its implementation within the United Nations. That has been appropriate as we focus on ensuring the mainstreaming of a gender perspective throughout the work of the Organization. We believe that in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals, it is important that a gender perspective be integrated into all strategies and programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">In that context, Iceland warmly welcomes the United Nations action plan for implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> across the United Nations system, which has been presented to the Security Council in the report of the Secretary-General. The system-wide action plan is an important tool for better coordination and for building on the synergies of the United Nations system. With the adoption of the action plan, the United Nations is creating a good precedent which should encourage Member States to mainstream the gender perspective in their own policies. We also hope that the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Support Office which our leaders decided to establish will demonstrate a strong commitment to the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">Women in war and women who have survived war must enjoy protection and justice, and women must be full agents in the shaping and rebuilding of their communities in the aftermath of war. Therefore, we must ensure that the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> are realized and that women can fully and equally participate at all levels of decision-making with regard to conflict prevention and peacebuilding. It is our duty to continue our work towards the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> at the national, regional and international levels.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">The Icelandic authorities have put emphasis on supporting the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. Indeed, an important part of Iceland's development cooperation is directed towards facilitating a smooth transition from conflict situations, with special emphasis on women and their role in peacebuilding. Here, Iceland's support to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) is especially worth highlighting. Iceland's contribution to UNIFEM has more than doubled this year. And for the past few years, the Icelandic Crisis Response Unit has seconded a gender expert to UNIFEM in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">Finally, I would like to underline that Iceland strongly condemns the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse committed by United Nations peacekeeping personnel, and we fully support the Secretary-General in his determination to uproot such behaviour. Such abuse undermines our peace efforts and the credibility of the United Nations. Efforts must be redoubled, and preventive education in this field must be a continuous feature of the training of the United Nations peacekeepers.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Abdelaziz</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">It is my pleasure to address you today on behalf of the Arab Group and to express the Group's appreciation for the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on the fifth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">I thank those who preceded me for reflecting on the United Nations system-wide efforts to strengthen commitment, accountability and transparency and to evaluate, monitor and report the progress realized.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">The Arab countries work in close cooperation with the United Nations system to strengthen the means of protecting women during times of conflict, and to consolidate the role of women and their participation in post-conflict stages. That is in concert with our belief in the major role that women play, especially under the exceptional circumstances represented by foreign occupation with the ensuing deterioration of the humanitarian and economic situation and negative effects on economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">However, an evaluation of the international situation, five years after <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> shows that we have not realized many of the objectives we had hoped for. Palestinian women are still suffering under the pressures of occupation, aggravated by the construction of settlements and the separation wall. They are subjected to the worst and harshest treatment at crossings and checkpoints. As a result of the deaths of many of the husbands and sons of Palestinian women, they have assumed more demanding family obligations beyond their capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">Consequently, the Arab Group calls upon the Security Council to take into consideration the situation of Palestinian women under foreign occupation, in addition to that of Syrian and Lebanese women in other occupied Arab territories. The Council must work towards the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab territories occupied since 1967, within the context of a comprehensive and just peace agreement, based on the implementation of United Nations resolutions, international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">It is difficult to speak of women without referring to a number of the initiatives taken by the Arab countries to enhance the status of women, not only in times of conflict but also in peacebuilding. The first is the establishment of the Arab Women's Organization, which has become an effective Arab institution to safeguard and defend the rights of Arab women, leading towards the realization of the objectives of broader freedom and participation and overall advancement. The organization also seeks coordination and cooperation among Arab countries in enhancing the position of Arab women, as they are the cornerstone for the solidarity of Arab societies. The organization seeks to coordinate the Arab positions in international forums that deal with women's issues, regionally and internationally.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">The second initiative is the first international movement for women, security and peace, which began in Egypt at a conference hosted in 2002 at Sharm el-Sheikh, a conference attended by governmental and non-governmental representatives and regional and international organizations and civil society and the United Nations. The movement was registered as a non-profit organization in Geneva in 2003 and has acquired legitimacy as the first international movement that seeks to coordinate responses to calls for putting an end to violence against women in times of conflict and other times, and to enhance the role of women in peacemaking.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that we should make the best possible use of all the main organs of the United Nations, each with its original mandate, and without prejudice to the role of the General Assembly regarding humanitarian, economic, social and human rights conditions, including issues relating to women. The Arab Group would like to state that international humanitarian activities should be carried out in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law, especially with regard to the agreements relative to women -- notably the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, and its two additional protocols, and the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Beijing Conference and its Plan of Action and the twenty-third special session of the United Nations General Assembly, entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century".</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Norway.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Løvald</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">Norway welcomes the Secretary-General's report including the system-wide action plan. The document serves as a welcome follow-up of the outcome of the 2005 world summit.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">With the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, the Council affirmed its commitment to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Much has been achieved with regard to gender mainstreaming. However, when it comes to peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation, much remains to be done to honour the commitments made. There has not been a great increase in women's participation in conflict resolution, and the protection of women living in situations of armed conflict is still a great challenge.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">Despite the substantial efforts made by the United Nations following the reports of sexual abuse and exploitation by personnel in the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) last year, that continues to be a problem. Sexual abuse and exploitation of civilians by peacekeepers is unacceptable. It undermines the credibility of the United Nations and erodes the moral stature of the Organization. The troop-contributing countries have a clear responsibility for the behaviour of their troops and must ensure that codes of conduct are enforced. Impunity for serious acts of violence must end. Member States should make every effort to contribute to systematic pre-deployment gender training for military and police. We must help to empower local women and assist women's networks and organizations to conduct public information campaigns to combat the culture of abuse and silence.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">We cannot put the entire responsibility on the troop-contributing countries. The full backing of the United Nations Organization, including the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), is needed to reverse the negative trend. Norway has offered to finance a study for the DPKO on lessons learned and best practices regarding how effective implementation of a gender perspective can contribute to the success of a peace mission.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">More importance should be attached to the gender advisers. Only 10 missions have a full-time gender advisory position, while what is needed is teams of gender specialists to support the gender advisers in dealing with the huge requirements and scope of programmes undertaken as part of the mission. Gender awareness must be recognised as the basis for the successful design and implementation of all post-conflict work. Only ten missions have a full-time gender advisory position, while what is needed are teams of gender specialists to support the gender advisers in dealing with the huge requirements and the scope of programmes undertaken as part of the mission. Gender awareness must be recognized as the basis for the successful design and implementation of all post-conflict work.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">To ensure that a gender perspective is systematically integrated in policies and recommendations to the Peacebuilding Commission, Norway would support the inclusion of a senior gender adviser in the proposed Peacebuilding Support Office.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">It is particularly important to improve the gender balance in peace missions. Norway supports the Swedish proposal that the observer categories participating in United Nations peace missions should be expanded to include civilian observers. This would broaden the recruitment base and make a better gender balance in United Nations peace missions more achievable. The experience from mixed military and civilian Provincial Reconstruction Teams in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) can provide valuable input to the discussion on the inclusion of civilian observers in United Nations peace missions.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">Norway welcomes the action plans on gender mainstreaming and the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> from each of the peacekeeping missions. It is crucial that the United Nations itself be a model for securing fair and balanced representation between the sexes at all levels. The under-representation of women in the United Nations Secretariat, in particular at the senior level, is, therefore, a serious cause for concern. Also important is the notion that incorporating a gender perspective into peacekeeping operations means ensuring that sex-disaggregated data are included in the Secretary-General's reports to the Security Council. This is necessary in order to understand the reality experienced in the field by women, men, girls and boys.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">Empowering women locally is an important part of building lasting peace and laying the foundations for development. Women are seriously under-represented in negotiations, in constitutional commissions and in political forums. Obviously, this is an important challenge for the Peacebuilding Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">Enhancing political participation should be of highest priority. The United Nations must be at the forefront in promoting women's participation in electoral processes. While there are no international standards on quotas or targets for gender representation, there is clear evidence that where quotas are applied, either voluntarily or by law, they are an effective way of securing women's representation. The trend seems to be that many countries receiving electoral assistance decide on their own to apply quotas for the representation of women. Norway is confident that the United Nations has the necessary competence to assist countries in this respect.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Elisaia</span> <span class="nation">Samoa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I am honoured to address the Security Council on the question of women, peace and security. In doing so, I speak on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum member States with Permanent Missions in New York - namely, Australia, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and my own country, Samoa.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">This year marks the fifth anniversary of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security. It is now a matter of international consensus that the role of women is fundamental to the maintenance of international peace and security. At the 2005 world summit, our leaders reaffirmed this understanding. Today, we would like to express our full and continuing support for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, which remains the most important and comprehensive framework for action at the international level.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">We welcome the report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security. We urge the Security Council to continue to intensify its efforts to mainstream issues on women, peace and security into its work. We wish briefly to highlight the most important steps that now need to be taken on the basis of the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">First, there is a clear need for increased representation of women at all levels of decision-making in conflict prevention, management and resolution. We hope to see more women appointed to senior positions in peace operations in the future, and to see Security Council support for such progress.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">Secondly, the Security Council must act to protect the most vulnerable. Special attention must be paid to the specific protection needs of women and girls to prevent gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, in situations of armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">Thirdly, the Security Council must call for the prosecution of those who commit crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes, including crimes involving sexual and other violence against women and girls. There can be no impunity for such crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">Lastly, United Nations peace operations must lead by example. We wish to see greater participation by women in peacekeeping missions and increased accountability for the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the United Nations as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">The Pacific Islands Forum leaders welcomed the agreement reached at the world summit to establish a Peacebuilding Commission. It is a matter of highest priority to us that this new body should support and promote the protection and promotion of the rights of women and build on international work relating to women, peace and security. We urge Security Council members to ensure that a gender perspective is mainstreamed throughout the operations of the Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa09">The experience of Pacific Islands Forum countries in peacebuilding efforts in our own region makes this an issue of particular resonance for us. The return of peace, following recent conflicts in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, owes much to the role of women in the affected areas. We acknowledge the efforts of those incredible women today, and we urge the Security Council to respect them by taking further action on this issue in the United Nations.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Australia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dauth</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, let me begin by associating myself fully with the statement just delivered on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum. At this stage of the day, I understand, of course, that just about everything has already been said, and Permanent Representatives -- not including yourself, Sir -- have fled the Chamber and, if they are lucky, they are pouring their first drink of the day. So, I am sorry to add to the endless flow of statements, but it really is, of course, a very important issue.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">If I may, let me associate myself with the remarks I just heard made by my Norwegian colleague about the need to accelerate our focus on the disgraceful record of sexual exploitation in too many United Nations missions. This is a tangential issue in some ways today, but I do think it is very important indeed, and I am glad that it has been aired by our colleague, and I want to associate Australia with it.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">We warmly welcome the reaffirmation by leaders at the summit of their commitment to the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. Their reaffirmation of the landmark resolution adopted, as you know, five years ago demonstrates an increased international awareness of the gender dimensions of armed conflict and a recognition of the importance of women's full involvement -- full involvement -- in all efforts to promote peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">Women are often at the forefront of community-led conflict resolution and peacebuilding but are all too often excluded from higher-level peace processes. We have recently seen the significant contribution that women can make to effective peacebuilding -- as Ambassador Feturi Elisaia of Samoa just pointed out -- in both Bougainville and the Solomon Islands. We strongly encourage the participation of women in efforts at all levels to bring about and maintain peace and security. Australia strongly supports continued efforts to implement the resolution, and we are pleased to have contributed financially to the Secretary-General's study on this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">We attach importance to providing continued training on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> to Australian Defence Forces personnel. In that regard, we welcome the Secretary-General's new, comprehensive plan for reinforcing and integrating women's issues into the world body's peacekeeping and post-conflict operations. Greater sensitivity to the interests of women will also make a vital contribution to the challenge we face in addressing sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers -- which is not being done urgently enough. That is an appalling situation and a blight on a key area of United Nations activity.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">Through our aid programme we are continuing to focus attention on implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We have developed a training module on conflict analysis and peace, as well as on conflict impact assessments, which include gender components for use in our development assistance programmes, and we are continuing to incorporate the concepts of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> into those programmes. Following the violence in the Solomon Islands in 2000, for example, the Community Peace and Restoration Fund, whose goal was to contribute to the overall process of the restoration of peace and development, provided a critical peace dividend for the entire population. It enabled the delivery of immediate, direct and practical assistance to communities throughout the country and included 95 projects specifically for women. Under our Solomon Islands programme, we are also supporting a range of non-governmental organization activities to support community resilience and promote inter-community peace. We have also supported a peacebuilding and women's empowerment programme, which seeks to promote community-based trauma counselling initiatives, peacebuilding and reconciliation between communities. In Sri Lanka we are funding a number of activities specifically designed to reduce the scope of conflicts among communities. Those include a programme to address the impact of armed conflicts on women. The programme works with women affected by conflicts in the northern and eastern districts, as well as displaced Muslims and women in central Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">We recognize that progress has been made on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and certainly we welcome the work done to date in that regard. However, we must continue to ensure the increased participation of women at all levels and all stages of peace operations and to work towards the greater involvement of women in peacebuilding efforts. Australia reaffirms its commitment to playing its role in achieving those objectives.</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of El Salvador.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martínez Flores</span> <span class="nation">El Salvador</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">El Salvador welcomes the convening of this open debate by the Security Council in observance of the fifth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women, peace and security. That is an innovative mechanism, in which efforts to advance and promote women cut across every area of conflict prevention -- from the peace negotiation process to post-conflict reconstruction. In that regard, my country is grateful to the Secretary-General for his report on peace, women and security (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a>), which outlines a United Nations system plan of action to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">Five years have elapsed since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, and we would point out that positive and concrete results have been made through incorporating a gender perspective in this area -- both in terms of measuring the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, as well as in the role of women in peacebuilding.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">Our heads of State and Government lent their political support to the world summit outcome document (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 60/1</a></i>), which undertakes to transform the commitments made in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> into concrete action. The threats faced by civilians during armed conflicts, in particular women and children, underscore the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective as a fundamental part of early warning activities as well as conflict prevention measures. Therefore, we welcome the initiatives designed to establish early warning indicators with a gender perspective. That would contribute substantially to a better understanding of the ties that exist between gender and security. We are convinced that that linkage should be examined more thoroughly, both within the framework of the Security Council, as well as within the Commission on the Status of Women.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">We support the decision of the Security Council to include gender issues targeted by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> in the mandates of the various peace assessment and peacekeeping missions. Thus far, we have seen that that policy has been welcomed in the field and that it has helped improve the image of members of United Nations peacekeeping missions. In that context, we should point out that the Government of El Salvador has made a similar commitment along those lines, and we are pleased to recall that, at the request of the United Nations a few months ago, we have been participating with women police officers in the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara. This is a recognition of the successful establishment of the civilian national police of El Salvador as an institution -- established after the peace agreements. It is also a pleasure to be able to return to the international community today the assistance that was given to us under the auspices of the United Nations during our own peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">In that regard, we hope that countries such as ours, which have made the transition from violent conflict to peace, will obtain the opportunity we deserve to share our experiences with other countries in the future Peacebuilding Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">In <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> the Security Council recommends that Member States and all the parties to a conflict should include women in the decision-making processes of peace negotiations, as well as in the implementation of political peace agreements. El Salvador shares that point of view. Given our own experience, we suggest that we should also consider the active participation of women in initiatives to educate for peace through the transmission of values that foster reconciliation and coexistence based on a culture of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has made a fundamental contribution to El Salvador by promoting a series of initiatives, including, in particular, for the training of women to instil dialogue, tolerance and respect for difference in the rest of society. Restoring public confidence after an internal conflict involves civic participation, where the role of women is essential. We know that women contribute, through their complementary vision of reality, to identifying both short- and long-term priorities. That is why their presence is necessary in consolidating democratic institutions, in strengthening gender justice and in legislative debate. All of those reasons indicate that a gender balance should be maintained in decisions that affect public life.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">When possibilities are open to them, women assume responsibility in the transition process, becoming the backbone of the fight against poverty. In El Salvador we have learned that the transformation of society requires structures that foster equal participation in the new national project. However, it is important to train a society so that it can enter the transition process, where a new coexistence based on peace, development and respect for human rights can be realized. In that vein, it is up to the political parties to stimulate an extensive debate on equal participation and also to bring national policy decisions in line with the spirit of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">In conclusion, I would like to stress the Government of El Salvador's desire to always include the participation of women and the defence of their rights in our ongoing effort to preserve a lasting peace. The spirit of the resolution will show us the way. We have confidence in the coordinated work of the organs of the United Nations system.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I now call on the representative of Fiji.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Savua</span> <span class="nation">Fiji</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">We align ourselves with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Samoa on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum. We thank the Secretary-General for the action plan on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security across the United Nations system, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/636</a> of 10 October 2005. The report is very comprehensive and written with a view to strengthening commitment and accountability at the highest levels and to allowing for improved accountability, monitoring and reporting on progress of implementation of the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">Over the years, we in Fiji have always been mindful of the role of women in our society. We do not question their importance or the critical role they play in the development of our nation. The Secretary-General's action plan is most welcome, as it has opened new avenues for the consideration of issues that may have been bypassed or regarded as too difficult.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">Women in Fiji have served alongside their men in peacekeeping operations. They have moved away from their traditional roles of working only in the logistics supporting areas to front-line operations. These women are volunteers and like to serve in the promotion of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">Most senior posts in United Nations peacekeeping operations are occupied by men. We would like to see some women become the holders of senior posts that would reflect their contributions. It is high time that we extend our gratitude for their contributions to peacekeeping and other areas.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">One such area should be a commitment to develop a national action plan for the coordinated implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. Such an action plan should be public and be drawn up in consultation with civil society. It should also contain specific and time-bound activities, targets and monitoring and reporting mechanisms.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">Fiji and some of its neighbours will implement the action plan with the assistance of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), which over the years has been supportive of the launching of national policies and strategies to promote implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We expect little change as a result of the efforts of UNIFEM and civil society this time around. However, as has been stated, there must be some form of monitoring mechanism to ensure that national action plans are updated and that a review of the implementation of the action plan is conducted annually, starting in October 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">For five years, the Security Council has been seized of the issue of women and peace and security. Now that we have an action plan, we ought to move forward and establish a focal point and an expert-level working group to ensure the integration of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> into the Council's work. The plan is another milestone with regard to the issue of women and peace and security, and the journey continues. There will be other milestones. For example, we would support a request that the Secretary-General make recommendations to the Security Council by October 2006 on various means by which the Council could be more systematically informed of the use of gender-based violence by parties to armed conflict, paying special attention to the machinery already developed to monitor and report to the Council on violations against children in armed conflict. We would also wish to hear about various means by which the Council could do more to hold parties to armed conflict accountable for those violations by considering, for example, the imposition of targeted sanctions against such parties.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">Women and peace and security is an issue that should be of interest to all of us, regardless of where we come from. Indeed, all issues concerning women should receive appropriate and equitable responses. The action plan is, in our view, appropriate to the issue in question. It is now incumbent upon all of us to ensure that it is implemented fully in all its aspects.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Swe</span> <span class="nation">Myanmar</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">First of all, I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for the initiative you have taken in convening today's open debate on women and peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">It has now been five years since the Security Council adopted the landmark <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. By means of that resolution the international community chose to see women not merely as victims in conflict situations, but as active participants in conflict resolution and peacebuilding. The 2005 World Summit Outcome (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 60/1</a></i>) gives an added impetus to that notion by recognizing the importance of providing women with the opportunity for equal participation and full involvement in efforts to maintain and promote peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">Women and girls are among those who suffer most in armed conflicts. Therefore, they have a strong desire for peace and security and yearn to take an active part in the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">The underlying causes of conflicts are many and varied. In most cases, poverty, socio-economic and gender inequalities and underdevelopment are its root causes. In the case of my country, a union made up of more than 100 national races, the weakness of the constitution that was imposed upon us at the time of independence was the main cause of conflict. Because of that weakness, Myanmar had to face armed insurgencies barely a few months after we had regained our sovereignty in 1948. It was only recently that we were able to achieve national reconciliation, and 17 insurgent groups came back to the legal fold. Their representatives have now joined other delegates in the national convention that is laying down the principles of our new constitution -- a constitution that will be acceptable to all nationalities of the Union. I am happy to say that the women of Myanmar are taking active part in the national convention.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> also contains the important component of ensuring the protection of and respect for the human rights of women and girls. In Myanmar, the Government was instrumental in establishing the Myanmar Women's Affairs Federation and has been actively implementing policies to promote and protect the rights of women and girls.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">I wish to commend the Secretary-General for submitting an action plan for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security throughout the United Nation system. I have noted that the action plan contains strategic programmes as well as quick-impact strategies. We are happy to see that the plan is structured around 12 important areas of action. We are particularly pleased that preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations staff, related personnel and United Nations partners is included as one of those action areas.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">Myanmar's values, tradition and culture abhor the sexual exploitation of women. We therefore strongly support the implementation of a zero-tolerance policy. We are also happy to see that the action plan includes accountability machinery.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">I am confident that the action plan and the recommendations contained in the report, as well as the Peacebuilding Commission established by the 2005 world summit, will contribute meaningfully to the promotion of the role of women as envisioned in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Bangladesh.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chowdhury</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa01">It has been five years since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, a resolution with which Bangladesh, then sitting in the Council, was very closely associated. I wish to begin by thanking you, Mr. President, for giving us the opportunity to take stock of the progress made in implementing the resolution since then. I also wish to praise Romania for the excellent conduct of the Council's presidency during the current month.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa02">In the past, conflicts were largely inter-State or inter-empire. More recently, they have been intra-State, with subregional and regional ramifications. In many ways -- more than in the past -- civilians form the bulk of the victims. Two millennia ago, the Greek sage Aristotle wisely observed that all wars were waged for the sake of getting money. Not much has changed since then. But our power of analysis has grown over time, and we now observe -- perhaps more keenly -- that poverty, the struggle for scarce resources and socio-economic injustices lie at the heart of conflicts. And all of them, sadly, entail grave violations of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa03">It does not take much scrutiny to come to the conclusion that the most vulnerable segment of the civilian population comprises women and children. That is evident everywhere. Women and girls are often viewed as bearers of cultural identities. Thus, they become prime targets. When women suffer, so do children. In addition, children are used as instruments for the perpetration of violence, as that can be done easily and cheaply. The current hotspots of the world are replete with such examples.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa04">Women know the price that they and their children have to pay in conflict situations. It is natural, therefore, that they are keen and often better equipped to prevent and resolve such situations. They have sought to do so over generations as peace educators, both in their families and in their wider societies, fostering a culture of peace within and across communities. They often, therefore, aptly serve as bridge-builders of understanding across rivers of strife.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa05">It is in that perspective that Bangladesh, as a member of the Security Council, worked closely in the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. The resolution was primarily based on a simple thesis. It was that women's equal access to and full participation in all layers of the power structure, as well as their full participation in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, are essential elements for making and sustaining peace. The Bangladesh presidency issued a statement to that effect on International Women's Day in March 2000. Eventually, the process culminated in the resolution. Needless to say, Bangladesh remains committed to its full implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa06">Drawing from our domestic experience, we believe that gender mainstreaming and empowerment are critical factors for development. Access to education and health care, coupled with the provision of microcredit facilities, can unleash the entrepreneurial skills of individuals. We know that such empowerment of women helps stave off extremist thought and action. That includes the scourge of terrorism. Today, by adhering to those very values, Bangladesh itself is undergoing a quiet but significant societal transformation. Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and her Government have an unflinching commitment to those goals.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa07">The United Nations should work as a conduit for disseminating homegrown ideas and best practices, such as microcredit and non-formal education, that have proven to work in my country and many others societies of comparable milieu. Those ideas can be applied in post-conflict societies with the major involvement of women. They will form the bulwark of peacebuilding.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa08">Success in implementing the resolution, in our view, has been mixed. While we have integrated gender perspectives in some aspects of United Nations peacekeeping operations and also in some post-conflict peacebuilding efforts, much work remains to be done. We encourage the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to continue its efforts in that direction. The excellent presentation this morning by Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno, as well as his leadership qualities, give us the confidence that the desired results will come to fruition. Bangladesh, as one of the consistently top contributors of troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations, remains conscious of its responsibilities to incorporate essential elements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> into the pre-deployment training of its peacekeepers.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa09">The non-participation or insignificant participation of women in peace agreement negotiations is still a problem. Those peace agreements inevitably fail to address the special needs of women. Although women suffer most as victims of conflict, they are excluded from peace dividends. Our endeavours to resolve those conflicts and address their root causes will fail if we do not empower women. The formal participation of women in peace negotiations and decision-making processes is key to the effectiveness of conflict prevention.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa10">The 2005 world summit outlined several policy frameworks important to millions of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations. The operationalization of the peacebuilding commission by the year's end would be a giant step in that direction. Increased focus on conflict prevention; responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity; the effective promotion and protection of human rights; and enhanced rule of law are some of the achievements of the summit that would go a long way towards empowering women in the longer term and towards enhancing their role in conflict prevention and resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa11">We welcome the proposed system-wide action plan on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. It is our hope that it will be instrumental in integrating gender perspectives across the entire United Nations system. Such gender mainstreaming, of course, must take into account geographical, ethnic and cultural factors. To be successful, the action plan will require the necessary resources -- financial, material and human. That would have to be at all levels. The active participation of civil society is a sine qua non.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa12">Every generation must seek to bequeath to the next a better world. Ours must do the same. For that purpose, we must identify some ideals and seek to achieve them. It is such pursuits that lend vigour to our societies and create the positive ferment that is the <i>primum movens</i> of civilizations. Also, they help us to achieve greater heights across a broader spectrum of human endeavour.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">I now call on the representative of Peru.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Tincopa</span> <span class="nation">Peru</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">My delegation congratulates you, Sir, on convening this open debate on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women, peace and security, five years after its adoption. We believe that it will highlight the need to continue deepening the debate on a document that reflects a change in our way of thinking about the impact of armed conflict on women and girls and about women's participation in preventing conflicts, promoting peace and assistance to post-conflict reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">The world is acquiring a paradoxical reality in the twenty-first century. It is globally integrated in the productive processes, trade, financial flows and the communications revolution, yet it is fragmented by the proliferation of conflicts, internal wars, transnational terrorism and ethnic and cultural violence. Since the cold war, more than 33 civil conflicts have erupted or been revived in the developing world, causing more than 5 million deaths and creating almost 17 million refugees and displaced persons, among whom women and girls have been particularly affected because of their status in society and their gender.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Five years after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, and despite the efforts made to implement it , we are far from achieving the goals that we committed ourselves to therein. In that regard, we feel that the international community must continue using all available international instruments to end human rights violations against women and girls, as well as the impunity of those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, including acts of violence against women. We are aware that the international courts have an important role to play in that regard, but we believe that it is equally important that States first assume their responsibility for enacting justice and punishing the perpetrators.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">As to my country, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in June 2002 to determine accountability for the violence and terrorism that occurred in Peru between 1980 and 2000, including gross violations of human rights. In August 2003, after two years of investigation, the Commission presented its final report, containing a comprehensive reparations plan that the Peruvian Government has begun to carry out through a collective peace and development programme. I cite that example in order to acknowledge the work and leadership of the women's organizations that, with the support of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, participated in the post-conflict process and contributed to the recognition that persons who were sexually violated during the conflict and the children born as a result of such violations are entitled to compensation. With that recognition of their suffering and material support, women are now better placed to resume their role in society.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">We believe that the time has come to close the gap between words and reality. In that regard, we welcome the system-wide action plan that the Secretary-General has annexed to his report, focusing on strategies and activities that seek to improve the contribution of the United Nations system to the empowerment of women in conflict areas, and highlighting as a main goal the urgent need to strengthen coordination and accountability. We believe that the action plan must be updated as necessary and that we must continue to seek and develop effective monitoring mechanisms that will ensure its ongoing implementation. We also feel it important that the first review of the plan take place in October 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">I wish to reiterate that States must take the requisite firm steps to remove the obstacles that prevent women from being effectively involved in decision-making processes and from having access to the highest levels of the hierarchies of power. In that regard, we reaffirm the commitments we entered into in the outcome document of the 2005 world summit (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 60/1</a></i>), in which we reaffirmed our responsibility to fully and effectively implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">The inclusion of a gender perspective in developing and carrying out the work of the Peacebuilding Commission is of crucial importance, given that the Commission's main goal will be to bring together all relevant actors to marshal resources and promote comprehensive peacebuilding and post-conflict recovery strategies. The future Human Rights Council too will be of relevance to promoting and protecting the rights of women.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr. Guéhenno, Ms. Mayanja, Ms. Heyzer and the other participants for their work on behalf of women. The task is still to be completed. It should be carried out jointly by States, the United Nations system and civil society, especially women's organizations and groups.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Liechtenstein.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wenaweser</span> <span class="nation">Liechtenstein</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Six weeks ago, the world's leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. The fact that this resolution is one of only two Security Council resolutions that found explicit reference in the summit's outcome document (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 60/1</a></i>) is a clear sign that its adoption five years ago was a landmark decision. The resolution has the potential to profoundly change the way the Organization deals with conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding. However, that potential has yet to be fully used.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">The fifth anniversary of the resolution's adoption provides a welcome opportunity to assess the impact the resolution has had on the ground and to identify ways and means to accelerate its implementation at the local, national and international levels. We commend the remarkable work undertaken by the 37 United Nations entities that have contributed to the elaboration of the system-wide action plan. That plan provides a wealth of information on activities being carried out for women in conflict and post-conflict situations. It should facilitate the review of the impact of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. In order to make that possible, it will be necessary to provide for interaction and consultations with civil society, in particular women's non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">At the national level, such interaction could form the basis for the establishment of action plans for the implementation of the resolution. That would help to raise awareness of the need to promote the active participation of women in decision-making regarding all aspects of conflict prevention and peacebuilding. Without such active involvement, decision-making will continue to be ineffective. For that reason, we are also of the view that the mandate of the Peacebuilding Commission should include an explicit commitment to partnering with civil society, including women's organizations, through formal mechanisms at Headquarters as well as at the country level. That would go a long way towards ensuring that women's needs, priorities and roles in peace processes are duly taken into account in the work of the Peacebuilding Commission. To that end, 14 women Foreign Ministers, including the Foreign Minister of Liechtenstein, have signed a letter on the issue of the Peacebuilding Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">In order for women to be heard and for their concerns to be taken into account, they must be involved in peace negotiations. There is ample evidence that women are very active in informal peace processes. However, that is not the case in formal processes. All too often that is due to the fact that women are hardly represented in the official groups that are common players in conflicts and their settlement, such as Governments, political parties, armed groups and militias. In addition, a lack of knowledge of the manner in which formal processes are conducted or of international legal and other standards is often presented as an excuse for not including women in such formal processes.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">Strengthening women's capacity as peacemakers must be pursued in parallel with increasing women's participation. At the same time, women need to be encouraged and empowered to hold decision-making positions. Creating awareness of peace negotiations as a tool for achieving gender equality is essential.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">Against that background, we have constantly advocated the appointment of women as special representatives and envoys of the Secretary-General. Such appointments could play a major catalytic role in more strongly involving women in peace processes, especially when they reach more formal stages. They would also strengthen the awareness of the need to mainstream gender issues not only into peace processes but also into other political processes. We are of the view that the number and consistency of such appointments should become an essential element for the review of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and part of an overall assessment with regard to the nomination of women at the higher levels of peacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. At the same time, we are aware of the need to provide the Secretary-General with names of well-qualified potential candidates for such posts. We therefore invite all interested States and NGOs to join forces in gathering the necessary information to make the appointment of women to such posts not only a priority but a reality.</p>

	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Croatia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Mladineo</span> <span class="nation">Croatia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">Croatia has aligned itself with the statement made by the representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union, but I would like to add a few points based on Croatia's specific experience and achievements on the matter.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">At the outset, allow me, on behalf of my delegation, to commend the Romanian presidency for organizing this open debate to mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, on women and peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">Since 2000, the international community has increasingly come to recognize not only how much conflict particularly affects women and girls, but also how often women hold the key to its peaceful resolution. It will be important to examine ways in which the provisions of this important cross-cutting resolution can be better implemented at the regional and national levels.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">Croatia welcomes the United Nations system-wide action plan produced by the Secretary-General (see <a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a>), which aims at highlighting the importance of gender perspectives in conflict prevention and peacekeeping activities. In order to achieve success in the post-war confidence-building process it is essential to include women as active participants in post-conflict reintegration and reconstruction. That has also been borne out by Croatia's experience.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">The protection of women in armed conflict and women's fundamental role in conflict prevention and peacebuilding cannot be evaluated without taking into account that women are among those most affected by violence and the economic instability resulting from armed conflict. Yet, when it comes to negotiating peace, post-war reconstruction and reconciliation, women are grossly underrepresented. We should continue to press the main bodies of the United Nations, particularly its funds and programmes, to strengthen the participation of women in their work and to streamline gender issues. Post-conflict transition, recovery and reconstruction cannot be achieved if gender equality and the promotion of women's rights are absent.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">Croatia welcomes the increased involvement of women in peacekeeping operations, especially among human rights and humanitarian personnel, military observers and civilian police. In that connection, we strongly encourage the practice of mainstreaming the gender perspective into peacekeeping operations. At the same time, we must increase our efforts to improve the protection of women in armed conflict, parallel to acknowledging and enhancing their contribution to peace processes and to rebuilding their communities.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">The Commission for Gender Equality of the Republic of Croatia -- an intergovernmental commission entrusted with creating policies and coordinating all activities for the promotion of gender equality -- incorporated a chapter on women and armed conflict in the national policy for the promotion of gender equality for the period 2001-2005 and in its implementation programme. Both documents were adopted by the Croatian parliament in December 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">Some tangible results have already been achieved in pursuing the goals set out in the national policy. One such result was the inclusion of the study of international humanitarian law and human rights in the curriculum of the Croatian military academy as an integral part of the military education of the armed forces. Special emphasis is placed on the promotion and protection of women's human rights and the introduction of measures aimed at combating violence against women in war, in armed conflict and during post-conflict transition.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">We seek to apply a gender perspective in Croatia's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. During 2005, two Croatian women officers have been serving in the peacekeeping missions in India and Pakistan and in Cyprus. Currently, five women officers from the Croatian armed forces are serving within the German contingent of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. Preparations are taking place for a female officer to serve as a military psychologist in the peacekeeping mission in Haiti. In addition, a captain of the Croatian armed forces was the first female officer to take part in the Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">Of course, the success of the application of the principles and underlying themes of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> rests with Member States. In that regard, there is more that we all can do to ensure that women can fully and equally participate at all levels of decision-making with regard to conflict-prevention and peacebuilding.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Canada.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Laurin</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I am pleased to take the floor today on behalf of the Human Security Network, a cross-regional group of 14 countries -- Austria, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Greece, Ireland, Jordan, Mali, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Switzerland, Thailand and, as an observer, South Africa. On behalf of those countries, I would like to express our appreciation to Romania for having convened this open debate on women, peace and security -- a priority issue for the Network -- and to thank the panellists today, who have spoken with such conviction.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">At the 2005 world summit, the leaders reaffirmed their determination to fully and effectively implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. As we mark the fifth anniversary of that resolution and look to other important commitments, such as the protection of civilians and children in armed conflict, as well as to important milestones such as the 10-year review of the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, it is clear that we have the necessary tools for strong and concerted action in all situations of conflict and post-conflict reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission is essential if we are to preserve and build on international peace and security. In this year's report to the Security Council on women, peace and security, the Secretary-General urged Member States to take concerted action to integrate a gender perspective into the Commission's mandate and work. We have a golden opportunity to ensure that, from the outset, the Commission's work incorporates the knowledge and the lessons learned from the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. Effective and sustainable peace, justice and security will remain a distant goals if we do not view them from a gender perspective. The Human Security Network welcomes the letter sent to the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly by the women foreign ministers on this issue. The countries of the Human Security Network will work with other Member States to ensure that the Peacebuilding Commission fully integrates such an approach in its structure, mandate and practice.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">In this spirit I thank the Secretary-General for his report, which outlines the United Nations system-wide action plan for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. The Network applauds the efforts of the Secretary-General and the United Nations system in this area and warmly welcomes the action plan, which it commits to supporting in full.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">In this context, the Human Security Network strongly supports the Secretary-General's recommendation to appoint a high-level focal point or focal points to monitor the progress of implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> within the United Nations system. In addition, and as at last year's open debate on women, peace and security, the members of the Network call on the Security Council to seriously consider establishing a mechanism to monitor its own actions to integrate <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and other resolutions into its daily work, possibly through a focal point or expert-level working group.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">Furthermore, as States Members of the United Nations, we should all consider developing action plans and coordinated strategies at the national level for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> -- a process that Canada has already begun. (<i>spoke in English</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">Among the gaps identified by the Secretary-General in his report are the lack of systematic incorporation of gender perspectives in peace agreements and the lack of enhanced women's participation in formal peace processes. Those elements were the focus of the expert group meeting hosted by Canada in preparation for last year's session of the Commission on the Status of Women, which developed a framework for model provisions on peace agreements as a means of promoting gender equality and ensuring women's participation in peace processes. The Network welcomes that outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">Women are highly active and effective in informal peace processes. The challenge lies in their participation in formal processes where peace agreements are negotiated. There, women have been frozen out of the peace process and given no room at the peace table. In addition, a further challenge is that formal peace processes rarely take gender perspectives into account.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">The Human Security Network is committed to taking concrete steps to enhance the role of women and to integrate gender equality in peace processes more effectively, thereby strengthening the legitimacy of decision-making processes and, by so doing, assisting in laying the groundwork for a meaningful and sustainable peace for all. The Network maintains that the involvement of all of society at every step, including women and women's groups, is crucial to the enduring success of the entire peace process, from negotiation to implementation of a peace agreement. In order to achieve that, capacity-building in the area of gender equality, women's rights and the gender-differentiated experiences of security is required for all actors, both men and women, as is an active search for women leaders.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">Members of the Network urge the Security Council to systematically incorporate gender considerations in all aspects of mission planning and execution, particularly from the outset. This would result in directing peace support action towards security that is as real for women as it is for men. Concretely, that could mean, for example, that women's enhanced role in transitional justice mechanisms would more likely bring to immediate attention impunity for acts of violence and seek robust measures to address it.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">The Human Security Network would like to reiterate the importance of achieving gender justice and welcomes the conferences held recently on this issue in New York and in Stockholm.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa12">As we noted last year during the open debate on this topic, sexual and gender-based violence remains alarmingly pervasive in conflict-affected areas. The referral by the Security Council of the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court, and the Court's investigation into the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda, are very positive steps, yet they are testimony to the widespread allegations of horrific abuses against women and children in conflict situations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa13">In this year's report, the Secretary-General highlights once again that further action is required to prevent, document and report on gender-based violence, as we have not yet done enough. The Network reiterates that it is the role of the Security Council to work together with countries and Governments, as well as with the International Criminal Court, to prosecute such crimes and to eliminate the impunity with which they are perpetrated.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa14">In that regard, the Network welcomes the recent adoption by world leaders at the world summit of the principle of the responsibility to protect. We were particularly pleased that the threshold for action that was endorsed is an inclusive one, in that it holds not only genocide and war crimes but also crimes against humanity as a trigger for action. The definition of crimes against humanity includes all of the most egregious examples of gender-based violence -- the horrific results of which we have seen in too many conflict areas. We must continue to work to ensure that the international community has both the capacity and the political will to operationalize the responsibility to protect. In particular, a rigorous monitoring and reporting mechanism for gender-based violence will be essential to ensure that States shoulder their responsibility not only to prevent such violence but also to protect their own citizens from such crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa15">In conclusion, the Human Security Network believes that it is the role of the Security Council to ensure that planning and implementation of all multidimensional peace support operations fully integrate a gender analysis and aim to strengthen the many and varied roles of women in peace processes, whether of a political, humanitarian, development, policing or civilian nature. Members of the Network thus strongly urge the Council to give full consideration to the report of the Secretary-General containing the United Nations system-wide action plan on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, and to implementing the recommendations therein.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa16">We look forward to future discussions in this forum during which we can hear reports of how <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> has been implemented in specific conflict situations and how it has made a difference in the lives of women.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mabhongo</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">We are honoured to participate in today's open debate, especially given that this is the fifth anniversary of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security. My delegation associates itself with the statement made on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) by the delegation of Namibia as well as with the statement made by the delegation of Canada on behalf of the Human Security Network.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">As we commemorate the fifth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, we are realizing now more than ever the important role of women in efforts to achieve peace and security. Time and again, women have played a constructive and essential part in peace processes. They are gradually finding a place at the negotiating table, in the implementation of peace agreements, and in post-conflict rehabilitation, reconstruction and disarmament. It is high time for them to be included in those processes in a more formalized way, at all levels and at all stages.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">The continued under-representation of women in formal peace processes and other persistent obstacles and challenges resulting from situations such as gender-based violence, poverty, lack of rule of law and various forms of discrimination prevent women's full and effective participation in conflict resolution. Conflict destroys infrastructure and disrupts essential services, which has a negative impact on the livelihoods of women. We believe, therefore, that more must be done to achieve greater participation and effective contributions by women in developing and implementing post-conflict strategies and programmes. In addition to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, we already have other instruments at the regional and global levels which recognize and seek to enhance the role of women in peace processes. We should use these instruments, and we believe that, with sufficient political will, we can meet the demand for greater inclusion of women in peace negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> calls for the full inclusion of women in international peace and security processes and for action in four critical areas. We note that progress has been made in a number of those areas. However, it is clear that there is still room for improvement, especially with regard to the mainstreaming of gender consciousness in United Nations reporting and implementation systems.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">These goals, as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, can become a reality only if there are improvements in terms of information, coordination and cooperation, as well as strengthened commitment and accountability at all levels of the United Nations system. Enhanced cooperation with regional organizations and Member States, as well as civil society and women's national machineries, is also essential, we believe, to its successful implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">My delegation therefore notes with appreciation the United Nations system-wide action plan for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, as contained in the report of the Secretary-General. This working document identifies numerous actions that different role-players within the United Nations system can take to further its implementation and which can be used to monitor progress. We encourage immediate implementation of the Secretary-General's proposals so as to put this action plan into practice. Member States can also enhance the United Nations system-wide action plan by continuing to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, including through the development of national action plans or other national-level strategies.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">The decision by the 2005 world summit to establish the Peacebuilding Commission is, in our view, an important milestone and makes a further contribution to the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. It opens the door for women with a view to ensuring integration of the gender perspective in all phases of peacebuilding. Our own experience in South Africa has taught us that, given a chance, women can bring an important and much needed perspective to peace processes. Women are no longer simply the victims of wars and conflicts; they are increasingly an important part of the solution. We would urge the Peacebuilding Commission, once established, to pay particular attention to the knowledge and understanding women can bring to peace-building processes.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">It is disheartening that sexual and gender-based violence, including trafficking in persons, continue to be used as weapons of war in conflicts. In some parts of the world, gender-based violence has reached near-epidemic proportions. Every effort must be made to halt this odious practice and to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa09">My delegation also wishes to reiterate its condemnation, in the strongest terms, of all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions. In that regard, South Africa welcomes the comprehensive report on sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeeping personnel. We express our support for the efforts of the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and to enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. We note with appreciation the strategies and actions included in the system-wide action plan aimed at fully implementing those codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa10">In conclusion, as we look back at the five years of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, we realize that peace starts with women and that for peace to be sustainable, we should ensure that women live more secure and productive lives and are able to fully enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms. We should recognize their invaluable role and contribution as mediators, educators, peacemakers, peacebuilders and advocates for peace. In our view peace attained through the participation of all means, not only the silencing of guns after war but a sustainable effort at ensuring lasting peace and prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa11">My delegation therefore supports the Secretary-General's report before the Security Council as well as all of the initiatives undertaken by the United Nations in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mohd. Radzi</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">Let me join others in expressing our appreciation to you, Mr. President, and your delegation for convening this open debate of the Council on the important question of women and peace and security, especially in the context of the fifth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> concerning the participation of women in peace processes. We would also like to thank Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno for his remarks and the other invited speakers for their important contributions.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and the three subsequent presidential statements on women and peace and security (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-31.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/31</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-32.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/32</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-40.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/40</a>) constitute an important landmark and provide a practical framework for our action. The Council has clearly acknowledged the importance of bringing gender perspectives to the centre of all United Nations efforts related to peace and security and has called for appropriate action under a number of thematic and cross-cutting areas. My delegation commends the efforts of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Women and Peace and Security, in partnership with Member States and non-governmental organizations, in the preparation of the system-wide action plan, which will put greater focus on enhanced collaboration for the full implementation of the resolution. In that regard, my delegation noted with interest the action plan contained in the annex to the report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">At the recent 2005 world summit, our leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. They underlined the importance of integrating a gender perspective and of women having the opportunity for equal participation and full involvement in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security, as well as the need to increase the role of women in decision-making at all levels.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">We are disappointed that, despite the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, there seems to have been a merely nominal increase, if any at all, in the number of women participating in formal peace processes. Women's needs and concerns continued to be ignored in peace agreements, and women's organizations are often not given the necessary support to enable them to participate, especially in protracted peace negotiations. It is our hope that the adoption of the 2005 World Summit Outcome (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 60/1</a></i>) will provide new impetus leading to the actual realization of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">We call on all Member States, regional and subregional organizations and the United Nations system to enhance the role of women in decision-making with regard to all peace processes and to post-conflict reconstruction and rebuilding of societies. In that regard, my delegation welcomes the various initiatives and actions undertaken by Member States, United Nations entities, civil society organizations and other relevant actors focused on supporting and increasing the representation of women in peace negotiations and mainstreaming gender perspectives into peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa06">While we share the concern at the underrepresentation of women in formal peace processes, we are equally alarmed at the persistent obstacles and impediments women face as a result of situations such as violence against women, shattered economies and social structures, lawlessness, poverty and limited access to education and resources. Action must be taken to remove those obstacles and impediments. Malaysia believes that more needs to be done to achieve the greater participation and the effective contribution of women at the negotiating table and the involvement of women in developing and implementing post-conflict strategies and programmes. In that regard, my delegation encourages the Secretary-General to maintain regular contacts with women's organizations and networks, make use of their knowledge, expertise and resources and ensure their system-wide involvement in reconstruction processes, particularly at the decision-making level.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa07">We wish to express our abhorrence at the continuing victimization of and violence against women and girls, especially in situations of armed conflict, and the systemic use of abduction and rape by parties to a conflict as an instrument of war. We would like States to take the necessary measures against all perpetrators of such acts, in accordance with the principles of international law and domestic legislation, and to make provisions for the protection of women and girls in armed conflict. We wish to reaffirm the relevance of section E, on women and armed conflict, of Chapter IV of the Beijing Platform for Action.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa08">My delegation condemns in the strongest terms all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions. We welcome the comprehensive report on sexual exploitation and abuse by the United Nations peacekeeping personnel contained in <a href="../pdf/A-59-710.pdf" class="pdf">document A/59/710</a>, and the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations on its resumed session (<a href="../pdf/A-59-19-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/19/Add.1</a>). In that connection, we join the Council in supporting the efforts of the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and to enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. We are convinced that the strategies and actions included in the system-wide action plan to fully implement the codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures may contribute to the reduction and, hopefully, the elimination of sexual exploitation and abuse.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa09">Malaysia believes that the issue of women in relation to peace and security deserves the Security Council's sustained attention. It is our hope that the Council's deliberations on this issue will contribute to the enhancement of the role of women in peace and security and ensure the protection of women in situations of armed conflict. Other interlocutors within and outside the United Nations system could also be major and vital players in that endeavour and should be continuously engaged. Malaysia is committed to working with others that share a similar interest in advancing that agenda and ensuring the full mainstreaming of women in activities in the pursuit of securing peace and security.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Trautwein</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">At the outset, let me express our gratitude to the Romanian presidency for putting this important item on the Council's agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">Today, the thoughts of my delegation and of other delegations are with Aung San Suu Kyi, who still cannot play her important and necessary role in her country's endeavours for peace and security, reconciliation and democratization.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">Germany associates itself with the statement of the presidency of the European Union delivered this morning by the representative of the United Kingdom and would like to add the following remarks.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">Justice is classically represented as a female goddess: Justitia. In armed conflicts, however, crimes committed against women are the ones most likely to go unpunished. That is why we cannot overestimate the historic significance of the explicit inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, for which 100 States will soon have deposited their instruments of ratification.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">Germany, as a member of the group of friends of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, welcomes the fact that the mandates of United Nations missions now regularly make reference to that important Security Council resolution. Increasingly, questions related to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> are discussed in both open and closed meetings of the Security Council. During our term on the Security Council, we actively worked towards that goal. Whether in the context of approving peacekeeping mandates or of reviewing the impact of sanctions, gender implications must continue to be an integral part of the analysis and the decisions of the Council. In that context, we encourage the Security Council to include a stronger gender perspective in the upcoming mandate for the United Nations mission to the Great Lakes region.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa06">Five years after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, we are still struggling with the problem of sexual exploitation, abuse and the solicitation of prostitutes in peacekeeping operations. We strongly welcome the zero-tolerance policy of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) to fight those shameful acts. Germany actively supports the work of the Ambassador of Jordan and fully shares his concern that the issue of sexual exploitation must not disappear from our agenda and must be vigorously persecuted.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa07">Germany, among like-minded countries, is actively contributing to the steering committee for the DPKO workshop on policy dialogue to review best practices for enhancing gender balance among military personnel in United Nations peacekeeping operations, which is planned for early 2006. Germany itself began to integrate women into the armed forces in 2001 and is strongly committed to maximizing the number of female soldiers in the field.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa08">Germany welcomes the outcome document of the recent world summit (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 60/1</a>)</i> and the strong commitment expressed in that important document to the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. It underlines the vital link that exists between gender equality and peace and security in the world.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa09">We consider the decision to establish a Peacebuilding Commission as one of the greatest achievements of the summit. It is of vital importance that a gender perspective be integrated in the Peacebuilding Commission and that such perspective be reflected in the mandate of the Commission as well as in its structure. The outcome document stresses the importance of the inclusion of civil society in country-specific meetings. Germany believes that the inclusion of women's organizations will be of particular importance.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa10">Women are too often seen only as victims of armed conflicts. They are indeed key to ending conflicts and to stabilizing war-torn countries. Effective implementation of gender equality and increased involvement of women in all aspects of society can contribute significantly to reducing violence and preventing conflict. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Beijing Declaration, the Beijing Platform for Action and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> are clearly complementary and are human rights instruments of the utmost importance.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa11">Women are indispensable agents in the process of building democratic structures and strengthening civil society. Five years after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, women remain a largely untapped human resource in peacebuilding. Let us all work together to complete the important task.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Austria.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pfanzelter</span> <span class="nation">Austria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">Austria fully endorses the statements of the European Union and the Human Security Network. Allow me to elaborate a few points.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">In 2000, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> called for women's equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Little progress has been made since then. Women remain marginalized in the process of peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">At the 2005 world summit a few weeks ago, our heads of States and Governments reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">Austria firmly believes that women must be able to participate fully in peace negotiations, peace agreements and the development of a stable society. Now, the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission provides us with a unique opportunity to ensure the involvement of women in United Nations-led peacebuilding processes. Let us use this opportunity by integrating a gender perspective in both the mandate and the structure of that new United Nations body. That concept is contained in the letter addressed by women foreign ministers -- including Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik -- to the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">The Peacebuilding Commission should ensure, as part of its mandate, that women and women's groups are represented in peace processes, thus enabling them to play a meaningful role. Concerning the structure of the Peacebuilding Commission, Member States and organizations involved in its work should bear in mind the desirability of gender balance in all meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission. Austria believes that a gender advisor should participate in all meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission in its country-specific configurations in accordance with paragraph 100 of the summit outcome document.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">Moreover, special representatives, special envoys and other emissaries involved in peace negotiations should have firm guidelines to enhance women's participation in peace processes and transitional structures. Experience shows that a determined policy on the part of the international community in the immediate post-conflict phase in favour of women's participation, inter alia by ensuring that post-conflict legislation gives them a right to participate, can increase the long-term participation of women in political processes in their countries.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">As an example, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is currently taking action to enhance implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, has, with its handbook on monitoring women's participation, already achieved important results regarding the role of women in elections as voters, candidates and officials.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">Austria welcomes the United Nations system-wide action plan for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2005).pdf" class="nolink">resolution 1325 (2005)</a> proposed by the Secretary-General in his report. We now have a window of opportunity, with the United Nations reform process. It is up to each of us -- Member States and the United Nations -- to seize this opportunity and enhance women's participation in conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa01">I call next on the representative of Sri Lanka.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kariyawasam</span> <span class="nation">Sri Lanka</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa01"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security, adopted five years ago, is a landmark achievement. The review of its implementation is of immense importance to the international community because while we deliberate on this important subject, millions of women and children in all parts of the world still remain mired in disease, poverty and the adverse effects of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa02"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> was a result of the increasing realization of the need to address grave and systematic violations of the human rights of women and children in situations of armed conflict, as well as the recognition of the capacity of women and the contribution that they can make in peacebuilding. While the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on the Status of Women have addressed these issues from time to time, the Security Council -- the United Nations apex body mandated to ensure international peace and security -- by this resolution provided an impetus to mainstream gender perspective in promoting peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa03">Today, women and children account for the majority of civilians adversely affected by armed conflict. They are subjected to grave violations of human rights and to violence at the hands of repressive elements. In situations of armed conflict as well as during war-to-peace transitions and peacebuilding phases, women's needs are rarely addressed with the seriousness that they deserve.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa04">In all such situations, it has been observed that women are more vulnerable and invariably suffer most. That is partly a direct result of violence targeted against them. It is often due to an uneven share of responsibility that women have in running the household, caring for children and even earning a living for the family as war widows. In many situations, a level playing field in terms of gender parity still remains beyond the reach of women.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa05">The effect of armed conflict on the girl-child has been a grave concern in Sri Lanka for some time. Recruitment of children, including girls, to the ranks of an armed group in the conflict in Sri Lanka is a continuing worry for our people. The armed group LTTE, in gross violation of its commitments, continues such recruitment. This affects women in general, who are the primary care givers in most families. This situation where children, in particular girls, are being affected by armed conflict cannot and should not be allowed to continue by the civilized world, and the imposition of targeted actions against the perpetrators of such crimes is a paramount necessity.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa06">In our view, for any national or international action plan to be more effective and result-oriented, it should evolve through a process of consultation with civil society and other relevant actors, and it should contain a time-bound set of targets with monitoring and reporting mechanisms. The Government of Sri Lanka supports such processes worldwide and also as part of its national approach to peace and reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa07">In this context, we view <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> as a groundbreaking initiative. The resolution sets forth responsibilities that should be borne by the international community and Member States of the United Nations to ensure a gender perspective and security for women in its multidimensional aspects related to peace, security and peacebuilding.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa08">Against this backdrop, it has now become incumbent upon the Security Council to review the progress made in the implementation of its resolution, as well as to consider further practical measures to strengthen the safety net and security for women in situations of armed conflict and to promote their role in peacebuilding. In doing so, it is essential that the Security Council consider the following important measures.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa09">First, the Council should establish a focal point to ensure the integration of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> in the Council's work programme, as well as in mandates, processes and mechanisms of all relevant United Nations agencies. Secondly, it should request the Secretary-General to update, monitor and review the United Nations system-wide action plan on an annual basis. Thirdly, it should determine means by which the Council could be systematically informed of the use of gender-biased violence by parties to armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa10">It is time that the United Nations redoubled its efforts in taking immediate, coherent and coordinated actions to translate the commitments undertaken in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. My delegation fully supports all such efforts in the manifestation of Sri Lanka's commitment towards the protection of women and children in armed conflict and, more importantly, to further our belief in the value of the participation of women in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa11">May I conclude by recalling the words of Eleanor Roosevelt:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg030-bk02-pa12">"For it is not enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isn't enough to believe in it. One must work at it."</blockquote>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sow</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, first of all, I would like to tell you how much my delegation appreciates your organizing this meeting and the competent manner in which you have been leading the work of the Council this month. I would also like to thank Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno and Mesdames Rachel Mayanja and Noeleen Heyzer for their dedication to the cause of women and peace and security, as well as for the useful information and relevant analyses they have given us.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa02">My delegation viewed with keen interest this morning the UNIFEM documentary, which underlines the relevance of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. We would like to express our gratitude to Mesdames Sweeta Nori, Hélène Dandi, Elsie-Bernadette Onubogu and Mr. Anders Johnsson for the wealth of experience they have been so kind as to bring to our attention.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa03"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1325 (2000)</a> raises not only the problem of armed conflict's impact on women and girls and the role of women and girls in conflict prevention and resolution, but also their contribution to peacebuilding, as well as the commitment of various actors in the international community to shoulder their respective responsibilities in the implementation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa04">My country greatly appreciates the attention given to the resolution and the efforts under way by various actors in the international community for its effective implementation. We believe that the organization of today's meeting proceeds from the determination and willingness of the Security Council to continue to shoulder its responsibilities in this regard. During the consideration of this item on 25 July 2002, my delegation pointed out, inter alia, that as part of the responsibility incumbent on the various actors in the implementation of the resolution, each body of the United Nations system should clearly identify the areas in which it could make its contribution and subsequently find areas of complementarity with the other bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa05">Today, as we thank the Secretary-General for his report (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a></i>), we note with interest the development of a system-wide plan of action for the United Nations to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, thanks to the work of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security, in partnership with other actors. We welcome the identification of the 12 areas of action and the suggested approaches in the individual and collective responsibility of various bodies of the United Nations system. We feel that the action plan requires a more in-depth consideration in order to allow for a better understanding of the various responsibilities mentioned therein.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa06">Until we reach that point, my delegation supports the objectives and the timetables set out in the report, especially the periodic evaluation by intergovernmental bodies and inter-agency organs of the efforts of the United Nations system regarding the action plan. We emphasize the importance of the United Nations Chief Executives Board for Coordination, the Executive Committee on Peace and Security, the Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations Development Group in strengthening their collaboration so as to allow the inter-institutional organ to carry out its work successfully.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa07">We are of the view that intergovernmental bodies -- among others, the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on the Status of Women -- and the competent expert bodies should continue to play a crucial role in monitoring and following up the responsibilities of United Nations bodies. When the Peacebuilding Commission enters into force, it should also be involved in this exercise. Furthermore, my delegation emphasizes the importance of sending to the Security Council useful information on the implementation of the resolution, so as to correct the gaps noted in the report.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa08">In adopting the outcome document at the world summit, held in New York from 14 to 16 September, world leaders at the highest level recognized gender equality and the promotion of women, emphasizing the importance of women's role in conflict prevention and settlement, as well as in peacebuilding, and reaffirmed their commitment to the effective and full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa09">To this end, my delegation appreciates the interest that the various actors in the international community continue to give to the resolution, especially on this fifth anniversary of its adoption. We welcome the fact that the United Nations system has undertaken a planning effort that is as broad as it is complex, encompassing all the areas of activity covered in the resolution. We hope that, as already mentioned in the document, the strategies and activities included in the action plan might allow for an improvement in the contributions that the United Nations system will make to enhancing the activity of women in areas of conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa10">Furthermore, while the implementation of the action plan is incumbent first and foremost upon the United Nations bodies, it goes without saying that cooperation with the other actors, especially the Member States, non-governmental organizations and civil society, is absolutely necessary for the effective implementation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa11">While appreciating the methodological approach and accountability of the United Nations bodies, my delegation hopes that the periods for review of the action plan will enable us to consider a global strategy for the implementation of the resolution, taking into account the comparative advantages of all the actors involved. In that connection, my country, the Republic of Guinea -- with its experience in crisis management in the West African subregion, with its desire to involve Guinean women and with the support of the network of women in the Mano River Union in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding -- will continue to give its support to collective efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa12">In conclusion, I would like to indicate that we subscribe to the Secretary-General's conclusions and recommendations (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a>) and we encourage the Security Council and the international community to work tirelessly for the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg033-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Bahemuka</span> <span class="nation">Kenya</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank the Romanian presidency for organizing this meeting on an issue that we hold very dear to our hearts.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa02">In his statement to the General Assembly on 17 September 2005, His Excellency President Mwai Kibaki of Kenya placed women strategically at the centre of all development activities. Today, with the steady and sure progress towards the establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission, the role of women in initiating, nurturing and consolidating post-conflict peacebuilding is a given. In our remarks during recent informal consultations, my delegation stressed the need to incorporate this important element early on in building the formal architecture of the Peacebuilding Commission, as well as the need to deepen the role of women in the implementation of programmes to empower them in post-conflict areas.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa03">My delegation thanks the Secretary-General and his staff for the very useful report on women, peace and security contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/636</a> dated 10 October 2005. The guidelines in that document covers areas dear to my delegation. Those include, inter alia, mainstreaming gender in peacekeeping and political affairs; monitoring compliance with international law; expanding gender-sensitive programming in disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, mine-clearance, reconstruction and HIV/AIDS prevention; institutionalizing women's participation in decision-making; and preventing and fighting against gender-based violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa04">Regarding the enhancement of local women's capacities for peacemaking and peacebuilding, I would only urge greater synergy and energetic interface with local women's groups. That coordination will build on local best practices and obviate the need to reinvent the wheel.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa05">At the intergovernmental level, I would appeal for closer coordination. The idea of working through the High Level Committee on Programmes, with the participation of all concerned organizations and components of the United Nations Secretariat, is a very good one. Our experience in using a system of lead agencies to ensure dialogue, as proposed in the report, suggests that such a plan has to be very carefully implemented. Institutional conflicts and jealousies may arise that can hamper any long-term gain for women.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa06">The same can be said for coordination within the United Nations itself. Appointing a group of focal points instead of one focal point may diminish the institutional rivalry that so frequently manifests itself in our work. Kenya also supports the Secretariat's recommendations to biennialize reporting on implementation of the action plan. That can be supplemented by interspersed thematic reports, which, we agree, will balance the implementation and policymaking cycles and make for more rigorous implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa07">In conclusion, let me highly commend the many women who toil daily in the fields of the United Nations system in the area of peace and security. I thank them for their dedication, hard work and commitment to the cause of the Organization. I encourage them to continue their work fearlessly and tirelessly, for the final objective is beneficial for all mankind.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg033-bk03-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Israel.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg033-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Eilon Shahar</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa01">At the outset, Israel would like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open debate on women, peace and security as we mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa02">On issues having to do with economy, politics, diplomacy, security and all other aspects of our society, Israel firmly believes that women must play an equal role. We have no doubt that the progress and advancement of women will translate into nothing less than progress and advancement for all. To that end, Israel remains committed to the goals and objectives of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as to the principles outlined in the outcome document recently adopted by our leaders at the world summit. The outcome document appropriately reaffirms the commitment of all Member States to the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa03">As in all other areas, Israel is convinced that women must play a key role in questions of peace and security. We believe that an increased role for women on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides of the negotiating table will positively reshape the outcome of peace negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa04">The Israeli parliament continues to devote considerable attention to bolstering the role that women play in this area. For example, the Israeli women's equal rights law was recently amended -- in the spirit of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> -- and now mandates that the Israeli Government must include women in any group appointed to peacebuilding negotiations and conflict resolution. That legislation deals specifically with the adequate representation of women in shaping national policy and with the explicit goal of integrating women in all governmental boards and bodies established for the purpose of designing public national policy in foreign and interior affairs, including the resolution of international conflicts, inter alia, through peace treaty negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa05">Because Israel believes so strongly in the contribution of women to peacebuilding, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sponsored a series of seminars on the voice of women in conflict resolution and peacebuilding at the Golda Meir Mount Carmel International Training Center in Haifa. The goal of the seminars is to open dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian women and further education towards peace. Of the 300 participants thus far, 50 per cent have been Palestinian women.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa06">Those efforts are augmented by the work of numerous Israeli -- and specifically women's -- non-governmental organizations, which represent a wide spectrum of Israeli society and politics. Their active contribution and involvement in influencing Israel's agenda on peace issues, among others, have been widely felt.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa07">For Israel, the topic of peace and security is fundamental. Israel has endured more than 20,000 terror attacks in recent years. Just yesterday, Israel sustained yet another suicide bombing, which like so many of its predecessors, claimed the lives of innocent civilians.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa08">I would like to take a moment of the Council's time to address the comments made previously by my colleague from Egypt. In fact, he brings up a good point: Palestinian women are currently suffering. But, since the topic has been raised, let us be very clear as to the exact nature of the suffering. The seemingly endless barrage of Palestinian terror attacks against Israel has resulted in the murder of thousands of innocents. Palestinian terrorist organizations have time and time again exploited Israeli goodwill gestures and manipulated social realities to perpetuate terror attacks against Israelis. On numerous occasions women have abused their status to cross security checkpoints with explosives and other weapons. In fact, several Palestinian women have succeeded in carrying out fatal suicide bombings. Thanks to the security procedures that my colleague decries, Israeli forces have arrested Palestinian women intent on carrying out suicide bombings. Just this past July, for example, Israeli security forces managed to apprehend a woman who had attempted to exploit a medical visa in order to carry out a suicide bombing in the very hospital in which she was receiving treatment. So, without question Palestinian women are suffering, but they are suffering at the hands of terrorist organizations that take advantage of women's status to carry out barbaric attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa09">At a time when the Middle East is enjoying a new momentum as a result of Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank, it is our hope that all parties in the region will capitalize on the new opportunities presented. We firmly believe that women should play a unique role, helping the region to take advantage of this new era of hope.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk04-pa10">Both the status of women and the prospects for the future of the region are severely jeopardized when terrorists and their supporters manipulate women for evil purposes. Israel is committed to further advancing the role of women because it is right. Israel is resolved in its determination that women will play an increasingly active role in peace negotiations, because we recognize the unparalleled value of their contribution. And Israel stands here today, full of hope that an enhanced role for women in peace negotiations will build bridges of understanding in Israel and with our neighbours.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa01">There are no further speakers inscribed on my list. I am sure we all agree that this was a rich and meaningful debate.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa03">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the continuing and full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> and recalls the statements of its President of 31 October 2001 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-31.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/31</a>), 31 October 2002 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-32.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/32</a>) and 28 October 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-40.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/40</a>) as reiterating that commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa04">"The Security Council recalls the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution <a href="../pdf/A-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/1</a>), the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (<a href="../pdf/A-CONF.177-20-Rev.1.pdf" class="nolink">A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1</a>), the outcomes of the Conference and of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century', and the Declaration of the forty-ninth session of the Commission on the Status of Women on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (<a href="../pdf/E-CN.6-2005-11.pdf" class="nolink">E/CN.6/2005/11</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa05">"While welcoming the progress achieved so far, the Security Council stresses the importance and urgency of accelerating the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms the importance of full and equal participation of women in peace processes at all levels and urges Member States, regional and subregional organizations and the United Nations system to enhance the role of women in decision-making with regard to all peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction and rebuilding of societies.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the various initiatives and actions undertaken by Member States, the United Nations entities, civil society organizations and other relevant actors, focused on supporting and increasing the representation of women in peace negotiations and mainstreaming gender perspectives into peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa08">"The Security Council recognizes and welcomes the roles of, and contributions made by, women as mediators, educators, peacemakers, peacebuilders and advocates for peace, as well as their active contribution to reconciliation efforts and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa09">"The Security Council recognizes the constant underrepresentation of women in formal peace processes and is deeply concerned about persistent obstacles and challenges resulting from situations such as violence against women, shattered economies and social structures, lack of rule of law, poverty, limited access to education and resources, various forms of discrimination and stereotypes. The Security Council believes that more must be done in order to achieve the greater participation and effective contribution of women at the negotiating table and in developing and implementing post-conflict strategies and programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa10">"The Security Council encourages Member States and the Secretary-General to maintain regular contacts with local women's organizations and networks, to utilize their knowledge, expertise and resources and to ensure their involvement in reconstruction processes, particularly at the decision-making level.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa11">"The Security Council also encourages Member States, donors and civil society to provide financial, political and technical support, as well as adequate training for women's peacebuilding initiatives and networks.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa12">"The Security Council welcomes the United Nations system-wide action plan for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a> across the United Nations system, contained in the report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-636.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/636</a>), and requests the Secretary-General to update, monitor and review its implementation and integration on an annual basis, and report to the Security Council, starting in October 2006. In this context, the Security Council urges the Secretary-General to proceed with the appointment of a gender adviser within the Department of Political Affairs and to continue to identify women candidates for senior level positions within the United Nations system, including as Special Representatives. In this regard, the Council invites the Member States to provide the Secretary-General with candidates, as appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa13">"The Security Council reiterates its call to Member States to continue to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, including through the development of national action plans or other national level strategies.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa14">"The Security Council welcomes the decision taken in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 60/1</a>) to establish the Peacebuilding Commission and looks forward to its contribution to the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, inviting the Commission to pay particular attention to the knowledge and understanding women can bring, through their participation and empowerment, in peacebuilding processes.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa15">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to ensure that all peace accords concluded with United Nations assistance address the specific effects of armed conflict on women and girls, as well as their specific needs and priorities in the post-conflict context. Within this framework, the Security Council underlines the importance of a broad and inclusive political consultation with various components of civil society, in particular women's organizations and groups.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa16">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to integrate gender perspectives into the terms of reference of Security Council visits and missions and to include gender specialists in its teams wherever possible.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa17">"The Security Council condemns sexual and other forms of violence against women, including trafficking in persons, and calls upon all parties to armed conflict to ensure full and effective protection of women and emphasizes the necessity to end impunity of those responsible for gender-based violence.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa18">"The Security Council reiterates its condemnation, in the strongest terms, of all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Council welcomes the comprehensive report on sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeeping personnel (<a href="../pdf/A-59-710.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/710</a>). The Council also welcomes the report of the resumed session of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations (<a href="../pdf/A-59-19-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/59/19/Add.1</a>) and, taking into account <a href="../pdf/A-RES-59-300.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 59/300</a> of the General Assembly, urges the Secretary-General and troop-contributing countries to ensure that the recommendations of the Special Committee, which fall within their respective responsibilities, are implemented without delay. In this connection, the Council expresses its support for the efforts of the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, and notes the strategies and actions included in the system-wide action plan to fully implement those codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa19">"The Security Council urges troop-contributing countries to take appropriate preventive action, including the conduct of pre-deployment awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full accountability in cases of misconduct involving their personnel."</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa20">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-52.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/52</a>.</p>
