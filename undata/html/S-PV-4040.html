	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The draft annual report of the Security Council for the period 16 June 1998 to 15 June 1999, to be submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations in pursuance of Article 24, paragraph 3, and Article 15, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter, has been prepared by the Secretariat in line with the revised format agreed upon by the Security Council in 1974 and further revised in 1985, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The format of the draft report before the Council provides a guide to the activities of the Council in a concise manner. It should be noted that, in addition to the extensive coverage provided in part V on the work of the subsidiary organs of the Council, the annual reports of the sanctions Committees are to be found in appendix XII of the report, in accordance with the note by the President of the Security Council of 30 October 1998, <a href="../pdf/S-1998-1016.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1998/1016</a>. Further, the monthly assessments of the work of the Council by former Presidents for the period covered by the report have been expanded to include statements to the press made by the President following consultations of the whole of the Council. Such statements have been annexed to the assessments by the former Presidents at their discretion, pursuant to the understanding reached in the Council's consultations of the whole on 30 November 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The draft report was circulated by the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs on 25 August 1999 to the current members of the Security Council and to the members whose terms of office expired on 31 December 1998, namely, Costa Rica, Japan, Kenya, Portugal and Sweden, for review and comments, if any. A consolidated corrigendum containing those changes proposed by Council members or made by the Secretariat is also before the Council.</p>
