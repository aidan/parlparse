	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council warmly welcomes the agreement reached on 21 March 2008 by the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders and commends them for the political leadership they have shown.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council is encouraged by the launch of the Working Groups and the Technical Committees that will prepare the ground for the start of fully fledged negotiations, in a spirit of good faith, on a comprehensive and durable settlement under the auspices of the Secretary-General's good offices mission. The Security Council looks forward to the results of this preparatory process within the three-month timeline agreed by the two leaders, which it is hoped will build trust, momentum and a sense of common interest in the search for a just and lasting solution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council further welcomes the opening of the Ledra Street crossing, as an indication of political will to tackle issues that have obstructed progress and an important signal that both sides seek to improve the lives of all Cypriots. The Security Council looks forward to further such confidence-building measures.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the reunification of Cyprus based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation and political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, and its willingness to support the efforts of the Secretary-General to this end. In this context, the Security Council welcomes the readiness of the Secretary-General to assist the parties in Cyprus, and further welcomes the prospect of the appointment, after the completion of the preparatory period and based on progress, of a Special Adviser to facilitate movement towards a comprehensive settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the appointment of Tayé-Brook Zerihoun as the Secretary-General's new Special Representative to Cyprus, and expresses its appreciation for the work of the previous Special Representative, Michael Møller."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-9.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/9</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
