	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa02">Owing to the lack of necessary documentation for this afternoon's meeting, and also on account of the lateness of the hour, I should like to propose that the General Assembly extend the date of the closing of the fiftieth session to tomorrow morning, Tuesday, 17 September 1996. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the General Assembly agrees to this proposal.</div>
