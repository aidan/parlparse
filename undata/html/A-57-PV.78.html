	<p id="pg010-bk21-pa01">The Tunisian delegation is very pleased that the General Assembly has adopted the resolution calling for the creation of a World Solidarity Fund. The Assembly's approval confirms the decision made by Heads of State and Government in Johannesburg at the end of the World Summit on Sustainable Development to put this new instrument into action in the fight against poverty. The objective for establishing this Fund is to complement current operations rather than take their place. It will also create synergies through a variety of initiatives and existing programmes and funds.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk21-pa02">The Fund's activities should result, among other things, in improved living conditions, in particular in the areas of potable water, education, health services, housing, electricity, the integration of rural areas and the promotion of such income-generating activities as micro-financing and micro-enterprises. Last but not least, those activities will help to reduce gender inequality and promote opportunities for the economic integration of women.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk21-pa03">We would like to convey our thanks to all delegations that have supported this initiative since it was launched, in August 1999, by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia. We would like, in particular, to express our gratitude to the Group of 77 and China, as well as to the delegations of the European Union, the United States of America, Japan, Canada and Australia. I would also like to convey my thanks to all other delegations that demonstrated flexibility during the negotiations regarding the Fund. Our thanks also go to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the United Nations Development Programme and United Nations officials for their cooperation in the drafting of concrete proposals within the Fund's institutional and organizational framework.</p>

The General Assembly also decided to implement an ad hoc correction of the rates of assessment in 2003 of Afghanistan's contribution to the United Nations regular budget. That decision was possible only because of the new contributions to the Organization by two new Member States, which the General Assembly decided to accept in the same resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk12-pa03">Against this background, the European Union welcomes in particular the decision to request the Committee on Contributions to develop criteria for consideration and approval by the General Assembly regarding ad hoc adjustments of the rates of assessment, in keeping with rule 160 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. Such criteria must be in place before submission by the Committee of possible recommendations regarding appeals by Member States of such adjustments for the consideration of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk12-pa04">When developing the said criteria, the Committee on Contributions should take into full account that the decision contained in paragraph 3 is not a precedent and that future applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis, on their own merits and on the understanding that an application cannot have adverse effects on the scale of assessments.</p>

	<p id="pg024-bk09-pa01">My delegation would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to an omission in paragraph 76 of document A/C.5/57/L.49. It is true that my delegation, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, introduced draft resolution A/C.5/57/L.38. But, also in a formal meeting, we presented amendments to the draft resolution, which gave rise to document A/C.5/57/L.38/Rev.1. This is not reflected in the draft report of the Fifth Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk09-pa02">Furthermore, paragraph 78 reports that when draft resolution A/C.5/57/L.50 was introduced by the Vice-Chairman of the Committee as coordinator, and was then adopted, my delegation withdrew draft resolution A/C.5/57/L.38. That is correct. But reference should also be made to the fact that we withdrew the revised draft resolution contained in document A/C.5/57/L.38/Rev.1. Therefore, I wish to request that the relevant corrections be made to document A/C.5/57/L.49 when it appears as <a href="../pdf/A-57-649.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/649</a>.</p>
