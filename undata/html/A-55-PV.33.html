	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">This morning, the General Assembly will proceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">The 18 outgoing members are Algeria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, the Comoros, India, Italy, Lesotho, Mauritius, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Saint Lucia, Sierra Leone, the United States of America and Viet Nam.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">As of 1 January 2001, the following States will continue to be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Angola, Austria, Bahrain, Benin, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, the Czech Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Fiji, France, Germany, Greece, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Suriname, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Sudan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Venezuela. The names of these 36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account the number of States that will remain members of the Council after 1 January 2001, the 18 members should be elected as follows: five from African States, four from Asian States, two from Eastern European States, three from Latin American and Caribbean States and four from Western European and other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, their number not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline" id="pg001-bk04">
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">It was so decided.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">Regarding candidatures, the Chairmen of the respective regional Groups have informed the Secretariat that, for the five vacant seats from among the African States, the Group has endorsed five candidates: Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">For the four vacant seats from among the Asian States, there are six candidates: the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">For the two vacant seats from among the Eastern European States, the Group has endorsed two candidates: Georgia and Romania.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">For the three vacant seats from among the Latin American and Caribbean States, there are four candidates. They are Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa06">For the four vacant seats from among the Western European and other States, the Group has endorsed four candidates: Andorra, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States of America.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa07">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa08">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa09">I should like to seek the usual cooperation of representatives during the time of the conduct of the election. As members are all aware, once the voting begins, all campaigning should cease on the main floor of the General Assembly Hall. This means in particular that, until the election is completed, no more campaign material can be distributed inside the Hall and all representatives are requested to remain at their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa10">Ballot papers marked "A", "B", "C", "D" and "E" will now be distributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot papers and to write on them the names of the States for which they wish to vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa11">A ballot paper containing more names from the relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a ballot paper that do not belong to that region will not be counted at all.</p>
