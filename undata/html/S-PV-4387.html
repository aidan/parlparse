<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk09">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haekkerup</span> <span class="non-nation">Special Representative of the Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">It is a true privilege once again to have the opportunity to inform and update the Council on the state of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Since we covered a broad agenda in our last meeting, I will today focus on the Kosovo-wide elections and the establishment of self-government. I also look forward to answering any questions that members of the Council would like to put, and to hearing their comments.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">These are dynamic and challenging times for UNMIK. We are on the threshold of fulfilling the core objective of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> -- the establishment of substantial autonomy and functioning self-government in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">Three days ago, on 2 October, the election campaign was officially initiated. Expectations among ordinary people and political contestants are equally high. Kosovo is about to embark on a journey towards sustainable democracy, multi-ethnic dialogue and gradual normalization.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">UNMIK is making every effort to secure broad participation in the election. It is in the interest of all communities to have a recognized and legitimate voice in the future of Kosovo. Inter-ethnic violence and high criminality, mutual prejudice and intolerance are daily reminders of a post-conflict reality. The hope and potential manifested by the 17 November elections have to be nourished and cultivated by responsible leaders.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">Initial preparations for the 2001 Kosovo Assembly election have been made. UNMIK has finished a successful inter-pillar civil registration and voter service period. A voters' list is now being produced as well as a ballot, including political entities representing all of Kosovo's communities. The Council of Europe Election Observation Mission (CEEOM), responsible for the international monitoring of the electoral process, reports that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"overall, the registration process has been conducted in a manner which is in accordance with international standards".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">The great disappointment of the 2000 municipal elections was the decision of the Kosovo Serb community and large segments of the Kosovo Turk, Kosovo Roma, Kosovo Ashkali and Kosovo Egyptian communities not to participate. UNMIK is pleased to report that all of Kosovo's communities are now in a position to participate in the 2001 Assembly election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">UNMIK has provided secure and convenient registration facilities for all potential voters living in Kosovo and elsewhere in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Potential voters living in other countries were able to register by mail. Because early registration turnout was disappointing, especially in Kosovo Serb communities within Kosovo, UNMIK increased the intensity of its coordinated public information and outreach campaigns, and enlisted the help of Kosovo Serb and Belgrade leaders. The decision of Bishop Artemije and other local leaders to register and the unambiguous statements of support from Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle and from President Kostunica of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia led to significant increases in registration among Kosovo Serbs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">In order to accommodate the increased demand, the voter service period was extended by two weeks, until 22 September. Every community was offered another secure opportunity to register within that two-week extension. Although civil registration offices will continue to operate, the voters' list has now been closed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">With data processing still under way, it appears that more than 1.2 million persons will be eligible to vote, both inside and outside of Kosovo. Although UNMIK does not collect data on the ethnicity of registrants, we estimate that 83 per cent of eligible voters are Kosovo Albanian, 12 to 13 per cent are Kosovo Serb -- that is, approximately 155,000 persons -- and the remainder are primarily Kosovo Bosniac and Gorani, Kosovo Turk and Kosovo Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian. Based upon the best available demographic data, those figures indicate that Kosovo's communities have participated in large numbers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">The Central Election Commission has certified 26 political entities to stand in the election. One represents the Kosovo Turk community, two represent the Kosovo Bosniac and Gorani communities, three represent the Kosovo Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities, and one represents the Kosovo Serb community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">After much internal negotiation, a Kosovo Serb citizens' initiative, Coalition Return, reportedly backed by 21 political parties and non-governmental organizations, was certified on 24 September. This presents a genuine and critical opportunity for the Kosovo Serb electorate to participate in the shaping of the future in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa13">The political entities have complied with the requirement that one third of the first two thirds of the candidates on the candidates list must be women. Because the list is closed, meaning that the voter selects a political entity but not an individual candidate, this should result in women accounting for more than 20 per cent of the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa14">In response to widespread international concern over radical political movements and individuals, and in accordance with the commitment made to the Council in my last presentation, I have instructed the Central Election Commission not to allow any individual appearing on the United States so-called black list to stand as a candidate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa15">UNMIK and the voters and political leaders of Kosovo are now turning our attention to the 45-day campaign period, which started on 3 October and which will end 24 hours before election day. The civil registration and voter service exercise was notable for its order and lack of violence. A Political Violence Task Force has been established for quick and efficient response. Security operations for electoral activities are coordinated through joint election operations centres at the headquarters and regional levels.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa16">Public information and outreach will continue to ensure that eligible voters know where, when and how to vote. These efforts will be targeted particularly at smaller communities, women and disabled voters. In an effort to avoid the long queues and confusion of the 2000 election day, UNMIK has improved procedures, with a focus on order and voter convenience. Election day will be under 100-per-cent international supervision, requiring States members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to provide 1,800 international polling station supervisors and the Council of Europe election observation mission to engage another 200 international observers on election day. In addition, more than 6,000 voters are expected to be certified as domestic observers, including representatives from the well-regarded Federal Republic of Yugoslavia non-governmental observer organization, the Centre for Free Elections and Democracy (CESID).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa17">Neither the successful registration nor the certification of the Kosovo Serb citizens' initiative, Coalition Return, implies a commitment on the part of the Kosovo Serb community to participate on election day. Kosovo Serb leaders and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia/Serbian officials have not yet come out in favour of participation. UNMIK will ensure that any Kosovo Serb who wishes to participate has a safe and convenient opportunity to do so, and we will relentlessly continue public information and outreach programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa18">UNMIK is on the verge of moving into a determining phase of interim administration in Kosovo. Following the elections in November, the role of UNMIK in the transferred areas will evolve from that of direct administrative responsibility to one of oversight of self-government. As part of that process, UNMIK will transfer many of its interim administrative responsibilities to the provisional institutions of self-government. We will, however, continue to closely monitor and support the provisional institutions in their work in order to ensure compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, and with the Constitutional Framework and other relevant UNMIK regulations. It should be emphasized that during all stages of transition UNMIK's overarching mandate remains the same, as does the ultimate authority of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa19">The transition itself should be smooth and orderly, with minimal disruption to the provision of an interim administration and services in Kosovo. Much of the groundwork for the transition has already been laid, and the rest should be in place by 17 November. Following the signing of the Constitutional Framework, the first step in preparing for the transfer of responsibilities was the elaboration of an UNMIK regulation to set out the 10 ministries which will compose the executive branch of the provisional self-government. One of the ministers will come from the Kosovo Serb community and one from another non-Albanian community. Promulgated on 17 September, the Executive Branch regulation defines the powers and responsibilities of the ministers, as well as those of the senior civil servants of the provisional institutions of self-government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa20">The next step was to lay the groundwork for the transfer of responsibility to the ministries themselves. To that end, the departments of the Joint Interim Administrative Structure were merged into transitional administrative departments. The composition of those departments reflects the distribution of responsibilities found in the Executive Branch regulation. From 3 October until the certification of the general elections, UNMIK will continue to consolidate the transitional administrative departments while simultaneously preparing for their separation into provisional self-government ministries and reserved UNMIK structures. Also on 3 October, the function of "Co-heads" ceased to exist. All Kosovo Co-heads have been given leave with pay until 17 November 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa21">As part of the transition, the two institutions that have ensured the participation of Kosovo representatives in the decision-making process at the highest level will cease. The Kosovo Transitional Council concluded its activities on 2 October. The Interim Administrative Council will continue operating until the date of transfer of powers to the provisional institutions. There are a number of regulations that require the attention of this body prior to the transfer of powers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa22">After the certification of elections, the Assembly will hold its inaugural session. Preparations are ongoing to ensure that the Assembly is supported by professional and efficient services and that minority representatives can fully exercise in that institution the rights granted to them in the Constitutional Framework.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa23">At the top of the Assembly's agenda will be the election of the presidency of the Assembly and the President of Kosovo. When the President of Kosovo has nominated a candidate for Prime Minister, he or she will have an opportunity to present a proposed list of Ministers to the Assembly for ratification. Once ratified, the Ministers will take up their posts at the head of the Ministries of the provisional self-government of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa24">A key factor in this process will be the extent of Kosovo Serb participation in the elections and its implications for the composition of the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa25">Functional responsibility for the administration of Kosovo will be cleanly divided between UNMIK and the provisional institutions of self-government. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1244 (1999)</a> sets out the Mission's mandate, and its post-election areas of immediate responsibility are clearly delineated in terms of functions in chapter 8 of the Constitutional Framework. Functions transferred to the provisional self-government are provided in the Constitutional Framework, and for the Executive Branch in the Framework Regulation, as elaborated.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa26">Once the transfer has taken place, the structures of UNMIK and the provisional institutions of self-government will be separate and distinct entities. The future Assembly, though, will be able to pass legislation only within the areas of responsibility transferred.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa27">The Executive Branch will consist of the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministries of Finance and Economy; Trade and Industry; Education, Science and Technology; Culture, Youth and Sports; Health, Environment and Spatial Planning; Labour and Social Welfare; Transport and Communications; Public Services; and Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development. The internal organization of the Ministries will follow a standard guideline, which has been adapted according to the individual characteristics of each Ministry's areas of responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa28">The Ministers will be political appointees who have been selected by the Prime Minister and confirmed by the Assembly. The Ministers will be responsible for setting policy and political direction for the Ministries. However, they will not exercise direct administrative control over the Ministries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa29">In addition to support staff, the Ministers will be assisted by up to five political appointees. One or more of those political appointees will serve as a Vice-Minister, to whom the Minister can delegate authority in the latter's absence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa30">The structure of UNMIK itself will remain essentially the same. The Pillar system will continue to exist, as will the current distribution of general areas of responsibility across Pillars.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa31">Although most structures associated with the Joint Interim Administrative Structure will be absorbed into these Ministries, some will remain under the immediate control of UNMIK, as foreseen in the Constitutional Framework. In areas such as law enforcement, the judiciary and emergency preparedness, the bulk of existing responsibilities will continue to fall under my immediate authority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa32">Not coincidentally, these are the core areas in which policy is likely to have the most direct impact on the lives of minority communities. By retaining immediate authority in these areas, UNMIK will be in the best possible position to protect the rights and interests of these communities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa33">International staff members will be placed in the reserved and transferred structures. In the former, they will implement reserved functions, in line with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and chapter 8 of the Constitutional Framework.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa34">In addition, a number of international staff members will be seconded to the provisional institutions of self-government, mostly to the Ministries. A primary task of these internationals will be to oversee and monitor compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, the Constitutional Framework and key UNMIK regulations. To this end, a senior international officer will sit next to the Minister, where he or she will oversee and monitor as well as advise the Minister in his work.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa35">Other international staff members will sit in actual line management positions inside the Ministry, where they will implement certain transferred functions for a limited time under the authority of the local Minister. Those international staff members will gradually exchange their functional responsibilities for a purely advisory and oversight role as additional qualified Kosovo civil servants are identified and recruited.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa36">In the Assembly, international staff will provide technical and administrative assistance through the Assembly secretariat. This will include legal counsel to the political groups and to the presidency of the Assembly to ensure that all of the acts of the Assembly are in conformity with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the Constitutional Framework.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa37">A group of senior international advisers will assist the President of Kosovo, in particular in his or her external relations role. I will establish the necessary mechanisms for permanent consultation and support of my Office to the President.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa38">In this context, it is important to emphasize that UNMIK will take on a number of new tasks and responsibilities, which will increase the workload of the existing international structures. All our resources will be utilized to the full extent, and UNMIK cannot afford to lose either staff or technical support during the transition period.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa39">Kosovo civil servants will work throughout the institutions of self-government. In the Ministries, most Kosovo civil servants will report to, and come under the direct supervision of, the Permanent Secretaries. The Permanent Secretary will be the most senior civil servant in the Ministry and would be primarily responsible for administration -- financial and human resources -- as well as policy coordination and development. The composition of the Kosovo civil service has to include all the communities, as reflected in the composition of the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa40">Kosovo civil servants will also work within the reserved structures, where they will report to the relevant Pillar head, instead of to a local Minister.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa41">Although there will be a clear functional and organizational separation between UNMIK and the provisional institutions of self-government, procedures will be in place to ensure that the Assembly and the Government fully respect <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government. The issue of an eventual declaration of independence would hence be obsolete, since this is by no means within the authority of the self-government. On the contrary, I expect a joint spirit of close cooperation to emerge from the shared need to achieve a common goal. Senior officials from the provisional institutions of self-government and UNMIK will be called upon to work together on a wide variety of issues, from policy formulation to programme implementation, to ensure an overall unity and coherence in the administration of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa42">In addition to the institutional dialogue between UNMIK and the provisional institutions of self-government, I will consult with all the political forces represented in the Assembly on matters relevant to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(2001).pdf" class="nolink">resolution 1244 (2001)</a> and to the development of self-government in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa43">With the creation of the provisional self-government, a major step forward in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(2001).pdf" class="nolink">Security Council resolution 1244 (2001)</a> will have be taken. But it is not a goal in itself. It is part of a process. It is an essential means to create a safe and secure environment for all of Kosovo's communities. Only by taking the political process forward and making the politicians work together can we overcome the hatred and distrust created by the atrocities of the past, and only in that way can we facilitate a final political settlement in future.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa44">Those who do not support participation or put up unrealistic conditions for participation will harm that process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa45">The present concerns of all communities are recognized by UNMIK. However, there is no contradiction between remaining critical to aspects of the current, difficult situation and participation in the election. The answer lies not in further alienation and boycott. Responsible leaders who truly pursue the interests of their community must be encouraged by the international community to act accordingly.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">I want to thank Special Representative Haekkerup for that not just comprehensive, but even eloquent explanation of where we are in this process, where we need to go and, more importantly, where the people Kosovo need to go in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">The upcoming elections are a watershed event and my Government fully supports his efforts and those of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to prepare for the transition of authority to locally elected leaders after the voting in November. I want to emphasize that the elections cannot be divorced from the political process outlined in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. Provisional self-government will require responsibility and discipline from Kosovo's elected leaders.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">There was a clear message from the Council, during its mission to Kosovo and since, that we support a democratic, inclusive vision of the future for Kosovo with respect for law. That point is again, I think, reaffirmed in the statement that the Council will be issuing shortly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">I do not think any of us expect miracles, but we can and should insist on respect for the road map and the way ahead that the Special Representative has laid down, in keeping with the resolution. In pursuing that path, there can be no place for violence. There must be participation by all in the upcoming elections and in the institutions of Kosovo's provision self-government. I want to applaud UNMIK's efforts to that end. There must be improved security and support for the return of Serb and other groups that have been forced to leave, so that they can be participants.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">We are encouraged by the support of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for the registration of Kosovo Serbs and hope it will take a similar stance with regard to the voting. Full participation in the 17 November elections is the only way to ensure that a multi-ethnic character is preserved and that Kosovo Serb interests are embedded and respected in the post-election period.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Levitte</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I thank Hans Haekkerup for his briefing. Our heartfelt encouragement goes with him in the successful conduct of his mission.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The position of the European Union will be stated later by the Permanent Representative of Belgium. I wish to complement it with a few national comments.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The preparation for the 17 November elections is clearly the priority of the United Nations. We welcome the efforts of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR to ensure the success of the elections through painstaking preparation and the establishment of effective security arrangements.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The elections will mark an important stage in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. They will open the way to the implementation of the provisions for the Constitutional Framework for substantial autonomy promulgated by Mr. Haekkerup last May. The Kosovars will thus enjoy substantial autonomy within the context set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. As to the elected leaders, as Mr. Haekkerup has stressed, they will be able to exercise important responsibilities, particularly regarding the management and day-to-day administration of Kosovo. We look forward to the elections. Naturally, they are not tied to the question of final status. The Kosovar leaders must fully comply with the provisions of the Constitutional Framework. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General will retain the authority conferred on him over the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Broad participation in the elections by all communities should be encouraged. Through their votes, the inhabitants of Kosovo will shape the political, economic and social choices made by the elected institutions of provisional self-government. The interests of no ethnic group are furthered by non-participation in the decision-making process. Each vote will count on election day.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">In this respect, the participation of the Serb community remains a source of concern. Thanks to the support of the Yugoslav authorities, many Kosovo Serbs have registered on the electoral rolls, as Mr. Haekkerup stressed, but they now need to be convinced to vote on 17 November. The Yugoslav authorities, who have commendably supported the registration process, can make another decisive contribution by sending them a clear message along those lines. Massive participation by members of the Serb community will enable them, through their elected representatives, to assume their full place in the future organs of provisional self-government.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Like the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, France welcomes the developing dialogue between UNMIK and the democratic authorities of Belgrade. The nomination of Mr. Covi to head the Joint Coordination Committee for Kosovo has accelerated that development. On 17 September, the Security Council witnessed this at the meeting in which Mr. Covi and Mr. Haekkerup participated jointly. The intensification of that dialogue should lead to progress in the development of cooperation between UNMIK and Yugoslavia. This could have favourable repercussions, including for the integration of the Kosovo Serbs into the structures established by UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">I would be grateful if the Special Representative could outline his views on the avenues that could be explored to promote progress in these areas. What are the prospects for cooperation between UNMIK and Yugoslavia, for example in education, health care or culture?</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">Turning to the question of returns, in addition to actions already under way in Osojane and Leshtar, what are the prospects for 2002? What assistance could the Yugoslav authorities offer the Serbs who have returned to Kosovo in an environment that remains difficult? What progress has been made in recruiting members of the minority groups into the judiciary and the Police Service in Kosovo? What obstacles have been encountered?</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">It is well known that France is committed to anything that might be conducive to confidence-building in Kosovo. It was in that spirit that we decided to give more than $2 million to the UNMIK voluntary contribution fund. This contribution will help in the development of 14 inter-ethnic projects, particularly in Mitrovica.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">Finally, security and stability are priorities for all of us, as is the fight against organized crimes and extremism. These are our ongoing objectives. UNMIK, under the leadership of Hans Haekkerup, and KFOR, which has been led by General Marcel Valentin since 3 October, are working to that end despite the many challenges they still face. Political leaders and civil society in Kosovo must, however, take full cognizance of their responsibilities. During the lead-up to the elections, they must speak out more than ever before against acts of violence and cooperate actively with the international community to isolate and punish the perpetrators.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gatilov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">We are pleased to welcome the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup. We hope that his participation in our discussion today -- our last such discussion before the Kosovo-wide elections -- will help with the successful implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> in all its aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Like many other members of the Security Council, we consider the prospects for the success of the Kosovo-wide elections, scheduled for 17 November, to be contingent upon proper preparations for them and the direct participation of the leadership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">During the short period of time before the elections take place, we need to make additional efforts to resolve a number of problems relating to the security of the non-Albanian population. We need to make it possible for all national communities to participate in the vote and ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons so that they, too, are able to take part.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">As we have noted many times, the participation of Serbs and other minorities in the elections will not depend on whether they are requested to take part by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Their registration -- although it is an important factor -- is not necessarily an indication that they will participate in the vote. In order to ensure such participation, it will be necessary to ensure that the proper conditions are met.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">We fully share the concern of the Secretary-General, expressed in his most recent report to the Security Council on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), regarding the ongoing incidents of ethnically motivated violence against the non-Albanian population of Kosovo. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General referred to that issue today. That very unfavourable situation is also reflected in a joint report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Kosovo, which was recently published in Pristina. That report stresses, in particular, that there is still an unacceptably high level of ethnic intolerance, discrimination and violence in the province, as well as inadequate security and insufficient freedom of movement. As a result, members of the non-Albanian population are continuing to leave their homes.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">In such conditions, there is a growing danger that the elections may not be democratic in nature and will merely legitimize extremist forces and attempts to bring about the secession of Kosovo from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and to create a mono-ethnic State entity in Europe. That must not be allowed to happen.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">We believe that the leadership of UNMIK has a special responsibility in this regard. It is important that the stated objectives of the work of the Mission be matched by practical action. We hope in particular that the administrative decision prohibiting the participation in the elections of extremist candidates from two Albanian parties, which was signed by Mr. Haekkerup on 24 September, will be strictly complied with and monitored. This could, to some extent, mitigate the serious mistake that was made earlier -- that is, the registration of those parties to participate in the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">The establishment by the leadership of UNMIK of full cooperation with the authorities of Yugoslavia should be fully supported. We fully agree with the comments made on 17 September in this Chamber by Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia, Mr. Covi, that it will not be possible to resolve the Kosovo problem unless the leadership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is genuinely involved in the process.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Taken together with other measures, the conclusion of a status-of-forces agreement between UNMIK and KFOR and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a step in the right direction. We welcomed the recent decision of the Security Council to lift the military embargo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We are pleased that the Security Council has demonstrated trust in the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which has been cooperating constructively with the international community in restoring peace and stability in the Balkans.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">With regard to preventing illegal deliveries of arms to Albanian terrorists in Kosovo and from Kosovo to neighbouring countries, in particular Macedonia, we would like to stress that responsibility for this continues to lie with UNMIK and KFOR, as stressed in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1367(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1367 (2001)</a>. The urgency of this task has been heightened in the light of reports of the seizure in neighbouring countries of large consignments of weapons and of reports that Albanian militants in the Balkans have long-standing contacts with Osama bin Laden. There must be no pandering to terrorists and extremists, and the international presence in Kosovo must scrupulously comply with the task entrusted to it.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">In a broader political context, Russia attaches great importance to the creation of a legal basis for stability in the Balkans in the form of legally binding agreements between the States of the region, with appropriate international guarantees being provided.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, we believe that the presidential statement to be adopted later today will send a powerful signal to the Kosovo leaders, on the eve of the 17 November elections, that a stable future for Kosovo can be built only on the basis of the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kolby</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I, too, would like to thank Hans Haekkerup for his briefing and to reiterate Norway's full support for the efforts of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, including the preparations for elections. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report and for his presence here today.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">We welcome the progress reported with regard to the small-scale returns of Kosovo Serbs, the transfer of responsibilities to the municipal administration and the efforts to achieve economic recovery. But the report also shows that many challenges remain. First of all, the security situation for Kosovo Serbs and others is not satisfactory, despite the considerable efforts of UNMIK and KFOR. The task of ensuring a viable multi-ethnic society in Kosovo cannot be left to the international community alone. The Kosovar leaders themselves must more actively confront the sources of insecurity. They must make further efforts to prevent violence and extremism and to publicly and actively promote the return and integration of Kosovo Serbs and members of the other communities that belong in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The Kosovo-wide elections on 17 November will be a milestone in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. But it is up to the Kosovar leaders to make them meaningful and successful. Norway fully agrees with the Secretary-General that the participation of Kosovo Serbs and other minorities is critical to the legitimacy of these elections. Non-Albanians represent about 200,000 voters out of a total of 1.2 million.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Norway commends the efforts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities, in particular President Kostunica, to encourage Kosovo Serbs to register. We must now look to Belgrade for continued constructive engagement to convince the Serbs that it is in their interest to vote in November and to assume their share in the running of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Time is short. The election campaign has already begun. Lists of candidates should be submitted within a week. We must therefore work to achieve rapid results. The provisional self-governing institutions will not be representative without the broad participation of all of Kosovo's various ethnic groups.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">Our intention behind today's presidential statement is to give a positive impetus to this process. The statement will provide a clear signal that the Council is sensitive to the interests of all and remains fully committed to all provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> as the only basis for building Kosovo's future.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">Nobody must be in doubt that after the elections the Special Representative of the Secretary-General will continue to hold considerable authority, as stated in the Constitutional Framework, so as to ensure that the objectives of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> are achieved.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">A close and constructive dialogue between UNMIK and the Yugoslav authorities is crucial in order to realize these objectives. We welcome regular meetings between the Special Representative, Mr. Haekkerup and Deputy Prime Minister Covi as a good basis for enhanced cooperation between UNMIK and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia/Serbia Joint Coordination Committee for Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">We must also look beyond these elections, towards longer-term confidence-building and reconciliation among the communities in Kosovo. In this regard, it is important that UNMIK prepare for cooperation and dialogue between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities and the elected self-governing institutions in Pristina.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Norway's appreciation of the excellent cooperation between the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Haekkerup, and the former KFOR commander, General Skiaker, who handed over command two days ago, and of the tireless efforts of the women and men of UNMIK. They are now entering a critical and defining phase in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, not only for Kosovo, but also for the entire region.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mejdoub</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">First, I thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, for his introduction of the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The organization of the elections to be held on 17 November is, for all the inhabitants of Kosovo, as well as for the international community as a whole, a decisive stage towards inter-ethnic reconciliation and the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> to establish provisional self-government representing all communities. I believe that this is the first point that the Council should note.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">My delegation is pleased that the elections are being prepared in generally satisfactory conditions. It is encouraging to note that the Kosovars of Albanian stock have acknowledged, in their public statements, the role that the Serb community can play in the future of Kosovo. It is essential to be increasingly vigilant as we approach these elections, in order to deal with a worrying security situation as well as with continuing acts of ethnic violence towards minorities. We are confident that the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), together with KFOR and all the protagonists in the field, will be able to contain this violence, so that the parties may freely express their support for a multi-ethnic and multi-faith society.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">In that regard, we express our satisfaction at the establishment of a special team on political violence, whose role will be to coordinate action against any attempt to spread terror as the elections draw closer.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">We consider it essential that the Serb community take part in the 17 November elections. The participation of all the inhabitants of Kosovo in the elections is the key to the operation's success. In this connection, my delegation attaches the greatest importance to the dialogue of the United Nations Mission with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities, which, in our opinion, could encourage the Serb community in Kosovo to take an even more active part in this process. I concur with what several other delegations have said in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Tunisia attaches particular importance to economic reconstruction. While we support confidence-building measures for the inhabitants of Kosovo, the economy can act as a powerful catalyst for ethnic reconciliation. We also  consider that an autonomous government in Kosovo will be feasible only with a solid economic and financial base that would enable it to manage its own affairs independently. We therefore deem it essential to strengthen Kosovo's intrinsic economic capabilities and to achieve a balanced budget.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">With regard to the return of refugees and displaced persons, my delegation supports the plan of action adopted by the Joint Committee on Returns of Kosovo Serbs. We hope that all of the inhabitants of Kosovo will return to their homes and join in the new Kosovar social dynamic. We salute the important role that international organizations play in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">We reiterate our appeal that the sensitive question of missing persons and prisoners be settled as quickly as possible. We continue to believe that this is a humanitarian issue with significant social consequences. This issue still causes division and impedes reconciliation between the communities in Kosovo. We encourage the UNMIK/Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Contact Groups to make further efforts to settle this question.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">Mr. President, Tunisia will gladly support the statement that you will be making at the conclusion of this discussion.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">I pay a warm tribute to the personnel of UNMIK and to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, for their excellent work and assure them of Tunisia's full support.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01"> I now invite Mr. Haekkerup to respond to the comments made and to any questions raised by the previous five Council members.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haekkerup</span> <span class="non-nation">Special Representative of the Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">First and foremost, I thank the Security Council members for their support and for the very clear messages about their wish to see Kosovo Serb participation. I think that it is a very important subject, and I can assure the Council that UNMIK will do its utmost to contribute to a process that will lead to Kosovo Serb participation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">Of course, we think that we have done a lot, and I can document that. During the time I have been the Special Representative, the prospects for Kosovo Serbs have changed dramatically. We are certainly committed to finding even more areas where we can make improvements, and we will try to do that in a way that will facilitate a decision to participate in the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">We also are committed to dialogue with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in trying to solve problems of common interest -- especially, of course, problems concerning Kosovo Serbs. This process has already been continuing for some time, and we certainly will continue our efforts to find common ground in solving these problems to the benefit of all.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">I also have to say that even if the Kosovo Serbs should not turn out in big numbers for the elections, we will of course find ways to make sure that they are represented anyhow in our institutions because, as I said, the institutions are not a goal in themselves. The idea is that the institutions are a means to create cooperation to force Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs to work together through these institutions and in that way change the overall security situation. I think that is the real point about the elections and the institutions that we are creating: they are in-built mechanisms that will make them work together; and that is exactly what we want.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">On the joint report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), I have to say that it is very helpful that these two organizations, which have a watch-dog function inside our Mission, are pointing out that ethnic intolerance is still far too high in Kosovo and the security environment is still not satisfactory. This reflects the post-war society. It reflects all the atrocities committed in the past, and, of course, it takes time to overcome what happened. It is something that has to change inside people's heads.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">Of course, we can contribute to that, and time is on our side. But I also have to underline that time is only on our side if we do the right things and take the necessary steps to move the process forward. But I think we can achieve that, and what we have been doing up to this point actually serves that purpose. But it is not enough to create institutions. It is only an instrument to change what is inside people's heads so that they can overcome the atrocities committed in the past. I think that is exactly what we are trying to do.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">There was mention made by the representative of the Russian Federation on a status-of-mission agreement and a status-of-forces agreement, and I have to say that it is United Nations policy, I think, that the authority is given by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, so there is no need to have a separate status-of-mission or status-of-forces agreement. Resolution 1244 gives that mandate clearly.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">There was also a question about contacts with Osama bin Laden. I have to say that I have no indication that there should have been any contacts between extremist or terrorist groups in Kosovo and Osama bin Laden. But I would be very thankful for any information that member countries can give us regarding this, because it is very important for our picture of what is going on in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">There was also a question raised about detainees and missing persons. I think it is a very important subject, where we already have close cooperation and, actually, two contact groups with Yugoslav authorities, and we have been making considerable progress in exactly these fields, but there is still more to be done and we are working on that together with Mr. Covi.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">There were also some comments on political violence. I think there is full agreement that there should be no place for political violence in the election campaign or after the election campaign. It is a very important message. I have to say that all the major Kosovo Albanian leaders have been out condemning political violence. But we feel that there could be an upsurge in political violence in connection with the campaign and we tried to get KFOR to take all the necessary steps we can. But I have to say that the politicians are saying the right things. Whether this will have an impact or not remains to be seen, but it is important that they condemn the violence.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Koonjul</span> <span class="nation">Mauritius</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">We would like to thank the Secretary-General for the very detailed report he has submitted on the work of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). We also want to thank Special Representative Hans Haekkerup for his very comprehensive and useful briefing. We are particularly pleased to note that the preparations are going on well for the elections, and we are happy to learn that there is good reason to believe that 20 per cent of the members of new Kosovo Parliament will be women.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Let me seize this opportunity to reiterate my country's strong support for the efforts and the dedication of Mr. Haekkerup's team for the work they are doing in Kosovo. We have reached a very crucial stage in the run-up to elections next month. It is therefore very opportune for the Council to have this meeting to review the situation and to give our full support to the process on the basis of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">As the elections approach at a hasty pace, my delegation notes with satisfaction the considerable progress achieved during the past three months. The increase in the number of voters registered following the call by President Kostunica and Prime Minister Djindji to the Serb community to register is most welcome. My delegation notes with satisfaction the collaboration of the Yugoslav authorities with UNMIK. Mauritius also welcomes the initiative of the Kosovo Serb citizens to form a coalition party that has been certified to stand for the November elections, which shows the Serbs community's commitment to be part of the democratic process and to engage in constructive dialogue with their Albanian counterparts.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Now that the crucial moment is near, we call on all Serbs and other minority communities to keep up the momentum that has been created and encourage them to cast their votes on 17 November. We call on the political leaders to publicly condemn violence and ethnic intolerance and to use their authority to ensure that the elections are conducted in an atmosphere of peace and free of intimidation and violence.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">The security of the minority communities is primordial if we want those people to return to Kosovo. My delegation has taken note of the good progress made by UNMIK and KFOR to ensure the safe return of the minorities to their homes. We are, however, concerned that there is still the threat of violence in some parts of Kosovo. We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">The number of incidents involving the use of weapons, as reported by the Secretary-General in his report, is of great concern. We have noted that many people of the minority communities have been attacked by hand grenades and other light weapons. Activities of this nature should be curbed, especially during the period preceding the elections. We urge UNMIK and KFOR to pay particular attention in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">With the newly consolidated police and justice pillar and the several pieces of legislation enacted to regulate the possession of weapons and combat organized crime, we hope that the minorities will feel more secure in the province and that more displaced communities will return to their home. We welcome the initiative of UNMIK to take full responsibility for operating bus lines and trains, which will ensure the safe and free movement of the minority communities in the province.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">My delegation expresses its disappointment at the slow progress in Mitrovica. This area, which is considered as the microcosm of the problems affecting Kosovo as a whole, is still lagging behind, against all expectations of the Security Council. The strategy put in place by UNMIK to improve the security and the quality of life of both communities in the area is being jeopardized by the parallel structures maintained by the local Kosovo Serbs, though the issue has been raised several times with the Yugoslav authorities by UNMIK. The Security Council has on various occasions expressed his concern over this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">We reiterate our call to the Serb community in Mitrovica to participate in the UNMIK-led process to build and guarantee an autonomous safe and peaceful Kosovo. We also hope that the Yugoslav authorities will ensure that there are no parallel security and administrative structures in Mitrovica other than those administered by UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">Mauritius fully supports the presidential statement, and we hope that the elections in Kosovo are held in an atmosphere free of violence. Once again, we would like to commend the work of the international and local personnel operating in Kosovo who are helping to create conditions for substantial autonomy in fulfilment of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Like previous speakers, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report of 2 October 2001 on the activities of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). I also wish to thank Mr. Hans Haekkerup, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of UNMIK, for his very detailed briefing on that report.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">Despite the difficulties inherent in any human activity, we note that the information provided this morning by Mr. Haekkerup on the work of UNMIK is good and encouraging. UNMIK activities during this reporting period are another decisive step in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We welcome this outstanding progress and strongly support the Special Representative's ongoing efforts to establish democratic, multi-ethnic institutions in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">The report of the Secretary-General is very explicit about the preparation for the 17 November elections -- the establishment of the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government and the forming of the public administrative capacities that are necessary before handing power over to the people of Kosovo. In view of this I wish to make the following comments.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">With regard to the lead-up to the 17 November elections for the Kosovo Assembly, my delegation welcomes the good preparations for this and the registration of civil status documents. We consider that the establishment of inclusive, reliable electoral rolls is crucial for honest, transparent elections. We urge all those on the electoral rolls to participate en masse on 17 November. Each elector must know that his vote counts and that he can change the course of history in Kosovo by voting for leaders who really want to build a multi-ethnic, tolerant society in Kosovo. In order to do that, everything should be done so that the elections take place in secure conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">My delegation welcomes the inclusion of minority communities, particularly Kosovo Serbs, on the lists. Their participation in the elections and in the institutions of the autonomous government to be established is a major challenge that UNMIK, KFOR and the entire international community must overcome. We welcome the public information programmes directed towards the Serbian minorities to try to encourage the formation of Kosovo Serb parties and to encourage their electors to put their names on the electoral rolls and certainly to participate in the elections. The cooperation by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is something to be welcomed. We support steps taken by UNMIK to encourage participation by the Serb minority in the election, as set out in paragraphs 35 through 37 of this report.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">Furthermore, my delegation welcomes the launching of the electoral campaign on 2 October throughout Kosovo. We call on all citizens to participate in a free, fair campaign and to abandon any acts of violence. We wish to point out that UNMIK and KFOR are doing everything they can to ensure security during the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">With regard to cooperation between UNMIK and KFOR and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, we believe that the constructive dialogue between the parties should continue and be strengthened.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">Turning to the painful questions of missing persons, which remains one of the chief obstacles to reconciliation, my delegation welcomes progress made in this regard with the blessing of the Belgrade authorities. We support UNMIK and the parties concerned as they seek to implement decisions taken on this fundamental issue. We have no doubt that constructive, open dialogue among the parties involved will make it possible to overcome the last obstacles.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, my delegation pays tribute to Hans Haekkerup for his action at the head of UNMIK and to the entire staff, local and international, of UNMIK and KFOR for their resolve to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The international community must increase its support to UNMIK in this crucial stage of its commitment to Kosovo in order to make possible the realization of its peace, security and development objectives, as well as the building of a multi-ethnic society.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdivieso</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I wish to welcome Mr. Haekkerup and to thank him for the very valuable information he has provided today. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report. It emphasizes the achievements of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in recent months.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">There are several challenges before us, as we noted in the meeting of 17 September, and they must be dealt with in a systematic way. However, right now the priority should be the 17 November elections. These elections will consolidate the bases for the administrative structures that will be responsible for the political delineations for the future of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">For Colombia, minority participation in the democratic process is basic. The registering of 150,000 Serbians is encouraging. Now it is necessary for these individuals to continue in this process and indeed go out to vote on 17 November. The establishment of a special group to provide information to minority communities on the electoral system and the functions of the Assembly to be elected may make a considerable contribution to ensuring that the communities will participate on election day.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">We also wish to thank President Kostunica and the Serbian authorities for their appeal to Kosovo Serbs to participate and to register. We can already see the positive effect that had. It is very important that this cooperation be maintained to ensure that those who were registered continue to participate and to vote. What is more, given the date of the elections, it would not be a good idea to change that date in any way, as might have occurred with registering. Thus the support of the Serbian authorities and the minority leaders in encouraging voting would be timely and must start immediately.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">We agree with the Special Representative when he says that there is no contradiction in criticizing some aspects of the process and participating in it. In his report the Secretary-General calls upon all local political representatives and representatives of civil society to use their leadership to prevent political violence on the eve of the election. They must ensure that there will be a peaceful environment. All this will guarantee a positive result, which will be more representative.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">When we hear Mr. Haekkerup's comments on transition activities that all Kosovars, including UNMIK, have ahead of them after the elections, we know that this is an even greater challenge than the one before us now, during the stage that will culminate on 17 November. His account of future tasks shows us that the Security Council must provide some follow-up. We are convinced that in a very few weeks Mr. Haekkerup will be with us again to give a detailed analysis of such events.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">By way of conclusion, let me tell you of my country's support for the work being carried out by Mr. Haekkerup as head of UNMIK. We have seen his perseverance and devotion in recent months, and in facing the challenges now before him he will once again demonstrate his commitment to the people of Kosovo. We also commend the work being done, in particular by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to build the electoral structures that are necessary for the success of the elections to be held next month.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">Finally, I would like to announce our support for the text that is to be adopted after this meeting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Shen Guofang</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Haekkerup, for his comprehensive briefing. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his detailed report.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">The Chinese position on the Kosovo question has been reiterated on many occasions. I do not wish to repeat it today. Rather, I would like to share our views in connection with the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">First, the Kosovo-wide elections are drawing closer and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has done a lot of work to prepare for them. We support UNMIK, especially Mr. Haekkerup's efforts, in this regard. We believe that during the further preparations for the elections, UNMIK will fully take into consideration the views and suggestions from all sides, so that the elections will be successfully carried out in a fair and peaceful atmosphere.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">The second point I would like to raise concerns security. In paragraphs 7 to 10 of his report, the Secretary-General describes in detail the security situation in Kosovo, including incidents of assault, arson, murder and attacks on police forces that take place in minority communities. The report predicts that political violence might take place during the election. We would like to see UNMIK take effective measures to ensure the safe return of refugees and the rebuilding of the minority communities. We believe that the present security measures are insufficient.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">The third point concerns confidence-building. We have always maintained that promoting reconciliation and tolerance among all nationalities in the area is an important aim of the international community. It is the only way to bring about a multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. Confidence-building in Mitrovica is of vital and particular importance. Formulating a comprehensive strategy for Mitrovica was an important goal of the Security Council mission to Kosovo in June. However, there is very little progress in this area. We believe that violence still exists in Kosovo. Especially when the security of the minority communities is not guaranteed, UNMIK should take effective measures to increase trust among all communities. In particular, it should take measures to guarantee the safety of the Serbs.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">Lastly, we can see from the Secretary-General's report that UNMIK's communication with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has increased. We are pleased with this. As was pointed out by other colleagues, without the participation and cooperation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it is impossible to handle the question of Kosovo properly. We hope to see the further strengthening of cooperation between UNMIK and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The views of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be fully respected.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">Kosovo's situation is at a crucial juncture. The Security Council should follow closely the development of the situation. We will endorse the presidential statement to be adopted after this meeting. We hope that, with the cooperation of all sides, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> will be fully implemented.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Miss Durrant</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">Let me join in welcoming the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), Mr. Hans Haekkerup, and thank him for his very informative briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">Although the Council has over the last three months dealt with many of the issues raised in the report of the Secretary-General, the report and Mr. Haekkerup's updates provide a useful benchmark in the process leading up to Kosovo-wide elections, to be held on 17 November. This meeting gives the Council a further opportunity to assess the activities of UNMIK in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">The assessment of the Jamaican delegation is that we have a good scorecard before us, particularly in regard to the Constitutional Framework and the institutions of provisional self-government, the engagement of the Kosovo communities, relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, issues relating to law and order and economic reconstruction. We commend the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the staff of UNMIK for developing a legal and administrative framework which could lead to sustainable political and economic structure for the future development of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">As my delegation fully supports the elements in the presidential statement which the Council will adopt later today, I wish to highlight only a few issues which my delegation regards as critical.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">First, in regard to the forthcoming elections, we note that there has been a substantial increase in voter registration, particularly of people from minority communities, with the active cooperation of Kosovo Serb leaders and the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, we have heard from Mr. Haekkerup that this registration does not guarantee the participation of members of these communities in the elections. We would urge full participation, particularly of the Kosovo Serb community, in the elections on 17 November and their subsequent participation in the institutions of self-government. We have also noted that the elections should result in a substantial number of women being included in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">My delegation agrees that substantial progress has been made in preparing the people of Kosovo for substantial autonomy and meaningful self-administration. The report of the Secretary-General provides details of a process whereby more and more responsibility and essential departments of government are being handed over to the people of Kosovo, in accordance with the provision of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. This has been complemented by the information provided by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">The elections on 17 November will establish a democratic process for the selection of the political leadership of Kosovo and will be important for the future decision-making process. Mr. Haekkerup has focused on the structures being set up to enable the people of Kosovo to operate effectively the different departments of government. These will provide a strong foundation for a viable and sustainable system of government.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">One of the main priorities of the United Nations presence in Kosovo has to be a reduction in the incidence of violence in the territory in the weeks leading up to the elections. The increase in the incidence of violence is a cause of concern to my delegation. Most alarming are the reports of numerous attacks on members of the international security presence. In this regard, the challenge of Mitrovica remains, despite the efforts of UNMIK and KFOR. Fear and mistrust continue to characterize relations in that part of Kosovo, and we would wish to hear from Mr. Haekkerup about how the situation in Mitrovica is developing in this period leading up to elections.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">My delegation is also very interested in the work of UNMIK in the area of returns. We welcome the attempts to establish a secure environment in which refugees and displaced persons can return home in safety and to an environment conducive to the establishment of a transitional administration. We are encouraged by the work of the Joint Committee on Returns of Kosovo Serbs and its adoption of an action plan for the 10 most advanced potential return locations in Kosovo. The provision of assistance for housing reconstruction is essential to that process, as is the provision of security. We believe that cooperation with the international community, in the provision of financial resources, and cooperation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be helpful in facilitating an environment conducive to returns.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">Besides the problem of housing reconstruction, the report of the Secretary-General has also identified occupied properties as among the obstacles to returns. We would also wish to hear from Mr. Haekkerup about the level of security and the type of economic and employment opportunities that exist in the 10 return locations that have been identified.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa11">The progress made in the consolidation of pillar I augurs well for the future of law and order in Kosovo. The recent signing of three key regulations designed to facilitate UNMIK's fight against organized crime is an important development. We welcome the efforts to recruit additional judges and prosecutors, and again urge that steps be taken to ensure that the judiciary is representative of the multi-ethnic nature of the society. The Kosovo Police Service will need to undertake effective community policing in the future and therefore must have the capacity and training necessary to carry out such tasks. We encourage further efforts aimed at capacity-building in the Kosovo Police Service and plans for the assumption of greater responsibility for border police operations by the fourth quarter of 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa12">Security and confidence for all the people of Kosovo are key to economic reconstruction. We are pleased to note the economic and financial measures taken, which have resulted in increased inflows of private investment and in improvements in the banking system and in the system of tax collection.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa13">Following the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1367(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1367 (2001)</a> on 10 September and the resulting termination of the arms embargo imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1160 (1998)</a>, I was authorized, in my capacity as former Chair of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1160 (1998)</a>, to submit a final report to the Security Council on the work of the Committee. I wish to advise members of the Council that the report has been submitted to the President of the Security Council; it covers the period 1 January to 10 September 2001 and is now available as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-2001-931.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/931</a>. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the former members of the Committee, and the Secretariat, for the tremendous cooperation and support extended to me during my tenure as Chair of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa14">Although the work of the sanctions Committee has ended, our concern about the flow of arms into Kosovo has not diminished, and my delegation -- and I am sure the other members of the Council -- will continue to pay close attention to efforts to eliminate unauthorized weapons in Kosovo. We urge UNMIK and KFOR to continue their work in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa15">In conclusion, my delegation agrees with the Secretary-General that UNMIK's commitment to the goals and objectives of creating the conditions for substantial autonomy and for fulfilment of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> has begun to bear fruit. The international community's involvement and its support for the people of Kosovo must continue after the 17 November elections, in particular through support for capacity-building and for strengthening the ability of the people to provide security for all within a true multi-ethnic society.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Eldon</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Haekkerup, for being here with us today. This late in the debate, I do not intend to make a comprehensive statement. Nor do I need to, since the Permanent Representative of Belgium will be speaking later on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">I would like to focus on two aspects, and I would like to take as my text the Special Representative's concluding remark that the answer is not alienation and boycott. This, I think, is particularly relevant in the context of our discussion of the elections and of the new institutions in Kosovo, about which other colleagues around the Council table and Mr. Haekkerup himself have had a good deal to say. Clearly, the 17 November elections are going to be an extremely important step, and participation thereafter in the new institutions will be an equally important, if not a more important, step forward.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">I really want to underline the need for participation. It is welcome to have confirmation now that more than 150,000 Serbs have registered for the elections, and we recognize the key role that the authorities in Belgrade have played in encouraging that process. But, frankly, it is not enough that Serbs register. As Ambassador Durrant reminded us just a moment ago, that does not guarantee that they will participate. So the people of Kosovo from all communities must vote. We strongly agree with the Secretary-General that it is imperative that all communities participate in the elections and in the ensuing institutions of provisional self-government if they wish to have a say in the daily running of their affairs and indeed if they wish to build, and participate in, the long-term future for Kosovo that we all want to see.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">So we equally support the Secretary-General's call on the Yugoslav authorities to encourage Kosovo Serbs to vote. It is vital for Kosovo's future that Belgrade take a decision soon to support voting. As I have indicated before, that would clearly be in the best interests of the Kosovo Serbs, and also clearly in the interests of the multi-ethnic future of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">I also want at this point to draw attention, as others have done, to the ongoing dialogue between the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the representatives of both Belgrade and the Kosovo Serbs. It is important that this should make progress on issues of key concern to the Kosovo Serbs since such progress must be a basis for strengthened cooperation and trust in the future. The dialogue also provides a good basis for a Yugoslav Government decision to support voting in the election. Clearly, concrete results from the dialogue would underpin such a decision by Belgrade, which we hope, as I have indicated before, will be taken very soon.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">My second point relates to organized crime and extremism. Other delegations have mentioned this too. It is very clear from the Secretary-General's report and from other information reaching us that organized crime and extremism remain the key internal threats to Kosovo as well as to the stability of the wider region. As others have done, I would like to commend UNMIK for the progress that has been made on pillar-I -- police and justice -- issues since June.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">In particular, we welcome the planned increase in detention facilities in Kosovo and the creation of a Kosovo Organized Crime Bureau. It is very, very important that the Organized Crime Bureau should be up and running as quickly as possible, and I would be grateful for anything Special Representative Haekkerup might want to say about that.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">The lack of capacity in the investigative, judicial and penal areas has also been a considerable brake on the development of capacity in this area in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">We welcome the achievements that have been chalked up so far, but there is clearly a considerable amount that still needs to be done. I should like to ask the Special Representative what the prognosis is.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">Finally, I should not close without welcoming UNMIK's involvement in the recent regional meeting of Interior Ministers. That is a very helpful step. We would urge the earliest possible follow-up to that meeting, which, we hope, will lead to intensified regional cooperation on both organized crime and extremism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">Before I begin my statement, I should like to make a remark. I think that we have to get back to our system of drawing up lists of speakers, because today, as you rightly recognized, Mr. President, I was one of the first to raise my hand to be on the list; now I am the twelfth speaker.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">I reserve my right to return to this issue during consultations on the working methods of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">I am grateful to Special Representative Haekkerup for his comprehensive and informative update on the latest developments in Kosovo and on the activities of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">Let me express my appreciation for both the report of the Secretary-General and the presentation made by the Special Representative, I should like also to commend the efforts carried out by the men and women of the Mission in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">On 3 October, which was marked by the official start of the 45-day Kosovo election campaign, the Security Council and UNMIK entered a new stage of their activities aimed at bringing peace and stability to Kosovo. The results of the elections to be held on 17 November will not only open another chapter in the chronicles of the history of the province of Kosovo-Metohija; they will test the very efficiency of the Council's peacemaking strategies and policies.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">Before turning to the forthcoming Kosovo-wide elections, let me highlight a few issues related to the noticeable progress made by UNMIK during the period under review.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">My delegation strongly supports a further improvement in the relations between UNMIK and the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We are counting on a further enhancement of the institutional links between UNMIK, KFOR and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as we consider them key prerequisites for the stable development of a democratic, multi-ethnic Kosovo society.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">Important steps have been taken by UNMIK in implementing the Constitutional Framework, preparing for the transfer of authority to the provisional institutions of the Kosovo self-government, and enhancing institutional capacities. As a positive sign, let me mention the recent decision of the Special Representative to promulgate <i>(regulation 2001/19)</i>, which sets out the functions and competencies of the ministries of the provisional self-government and lays out general principles to guide the establishment of the civil service.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">I wish also to point out UNMIK's role in the creation of improved judicial, economic and social conditions in the province. The progress made in the police and justice reform is a visible and welcome development. The forthcoming completion of the Kosovo Organized Crime Bureau may provide another important impetus for improving the general civil security situation in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">It is very encouraging to note that the police forces are increasingly operational in almost all areas of Kosovo. In this regard, we welcome UNMIK's efforts to further improve the operational environment for the police, including steps to establish confidence in the Kosovo northern municipalities. Another noteworthy element is the growing capacity of the Kosovo Police Service, which should be enhanced and strengthened.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">As concerns the economic dimension, we fully endorse the priorities set by the Special Representative to hand over a balanced budget to the provisional self-government, to introduce modern financial management and to develop a Kosovo-wide public investment programme within the framework of the Kosovo consolidated budget.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">I should like to note also the useful efforts made in the agricultural sector and in the sphere of civil security and emergency preparedness capability. With respect to the latter, let me express Ukraine's readiness to provide the Department of Civil Security and Emergency Preparedness and the Kosovo Protection Corps with the necessary training assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa13">There is a Norwegian proverb that says:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg018-bk01-pa14">"There is no wind that blows right for the sailor who does not know where the harbour is."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa15">The general security situation in Kosovo remains windy but stable. However, the perceived security improvement could be qualified as extremely shaky. The recent Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) report on the situation of ethnic minorities in Kosovo stresses:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg018-bk01-pa16">"The negative attitudes and perceptions that continue to drive the post-conflict situation can come to the fore and lead to a sharp deterioration at any time."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa17">Moreover, the number of reported security incidents in August alone indicates that long-term improvements in the overall situation can be guaranteed only through an effective confidence-building policy and effective security, policing and judicial systems.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa18">In this context, let me stress that my delegation supports the results-oriented efforts of UNMIK and KFOR to improve the situation and enhance confidence-building measures through such important acts as the re-establishment of the Political Violence Task Force, the launching of UNMIK-Federal Republic of Yugoslavia contact groups on missing persons, and so on.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa19">Much more has to be done. A vivid example of the persistent problems in this area is the continued exodus of Kosovo Serbs and non-Albanian nationals from the province. I should like to quote the OSCE report I mentioned earlier, which states that the number of Kosovo Serbs in Pristina</p>
	<blockquote id="pg018-bk01-pa20">"is subject to constant fluctuation. Estimates for the current number of Kosovo Serbs [who are permanent residents] have fallen as low as 300."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa21">I repeat: 300 Serbs. That is quite something. It means that people do not want to return home because they are afraid for their lives; that they do not know how to live with others without fear; that there is an urgent need to improve the security environment through robust measures against any form of violence, including terrorist activities; and that there is an extreme need to facilitate dialogue not only between UNMIK and the FRY authorities but between the Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs as well. In the context of the forthcoming elections, these challenges take on special importance.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa22">My delegation fully supports the provisions of the presidential statement to be adopted at this meeting. We believe that the firm position of the Security Council, aimed at the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, and the active encouragement of all Kosovo communities to participate in the elections will give the necessary impetus to further stabilizing processes in the region. I hope that it will also send a clear message conveying a philosophy of peace and trust.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa23">As Ambassador Kolby recently said, the progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been incremental, not fundamental. It seems that these words will become another Norwegian proverb for me to quote today. We must be fully aware that the progress in Kosovo is still rather more incremental than fundamental. However, my delegation believes that the situation should be improved by our resolve and united actions. Kosovo stands on the edge of a new historic period. Sailors should know where their harbour is.</p>

	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01"> As to Ambassador Kuchinsky's introductory point regarding the order of speakers, he is, I am sure, fully aware that I am proceeding punctiliously on the basis of the speakers' list provided by the Council secretariat.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ahsan</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">Let me join previous speakers in thanking Mr. Hans Haekkerup, Special Representative of the Secretary General, for presenting the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and for his informative briefing and update on its important aspects. The presentation was especially important as he touched upon many issues before the Kosovo-wide elections, scheduled to be held on 17 November, and provided details of the post-election transition scenario.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">I will focus briefly on a few points in the Secretary-General's report and the presentation of Mr. Haekkerup.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">First, concerning the elections, the democratic process in Kosovo started with the holding of municipal elections there last year, which saw some success in achieving the representation of different communities in the interim institutions. However, the political engagement of the Kosovo Serbs has remained a challenge. We look forward to the November elections for further consolidation of the process. We are appreciative to the authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and particularly to President Kostunica, for encouraging the Kosovo Serb community to participate fully in the civil registration for the upcoming elections. A full participation of all ethnic communities is the only option for a peaceful future in Kosovo based on the greater tolerance and mutual accommodation of different ethnic entities.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">In parallel with voter registration and bolstering the security situation, UNMIK has a great responsibility in engaging different communities in the electoral process. We welcome UNMIK's efforts in reaching out to the Kosovo Serbs, particularly those living outside Kosovo, to inform them of the electoral system and of the importance of ethnic representation in the new Assembly and to lobby for their participation in both registration and elections. Here, I want to note with satisfaction the fact that 20 per cent of the representation in the new Assembly will be by women. The Mission can consider further ways of showing the Kosovo minority communities what benefits they can derive from engagement in community life and the electoral process.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">UNMIK has increased its efforts to strengthen law and order in Kosovo. Strengthening security measures is particularly important during the pre-election period, in view of politically motivated criminal incidents and ethnically targeted violence. We call on all community leaders in Kosovo, particularly those from the major ethnic communities, to come out clearly against any kind of violence. We condemn recent attacks against members of the international security presence. This must stop if the international community is to be helpful in realizing the hopes and aspirations of the Kosovars.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">We support the efforts of UNMIK and KFOR to improve public security, including through the confiscation of weapons and the packaging of legislation to combat violence and to encourage the return of displaced persons. We call on the Kosovo Albanian leaders to extend active support to those efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">We encourage further constructive engagement between UNMIK and authorities in Belgrade. UNMIK's Belgrade Office has proved to be a valuable instrument in facilitating and regularizing contacts between UNMIK and authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We welcome the important steps taken by Belgrade in appointing Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covi, who briefed the Council on 17 September, as head of the Joint Coordination Committee for Kosovo. We believe that intensification of contacts between UNMIK and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would pave the way for better ethnic tolerance and accommodation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">In closing, we would like to say that we endorse the statement that the Council will adopt at the conclusion of this meeting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yap</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">At the outset, we would like to welcome the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, and to thank him for his detailed briefing. It was a useful update of the Secretary-General's comprehensive report, which we would like to thank the Secretary-General for.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">We reiterate our support for the tireless efforts of Special Representative Haekkerup and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in fully implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and primarily at this time in building the necessary conditions for free and fair general elections and an all-inclusive provisional self-government in Kosovo. Specifically, we support the goals of securing the engagement and participation of Kosovo Serbs and other minorities, the return of refugees and displaced persons, the development of a safe and secure environment and the building of public administration and economic capacities. These are essential for the handing-over of authority leading to substantial autonomy in Kosovo, as mandated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We note the good progress made by UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">At the same time, however, we note that a number of problems in achieving those goals remain. Significantly, Kosovo's security situation remains precarious, with violence against minorities and criminal activity continuing unabated, despite the reinforcement of law and order. Also significant is the fact that, in the election campaigning that started this Wednesday, the ethnic Albanian parties are using the platform of independence for Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">We would therefore appreciate Mr. Haekkerup's assessment of the extent of ethnic minority, especially Serb, participation in the upcoming elections and the provisional self-government institutions thereafter, and of what this portends for Kosovo's stability. While not wanting to sound pessimistic, we would like to ask Mr. Haekkerup about the contingencies that are being considered by UNMIK to ensure that things do not get out of hand.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">Should Kosovo's transition to substantial autonomy be carried out smoothly, UNMIK will have accomplished an important mandate under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. At the public meeting on Kosovo this July, we stated that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa06">"The United Nations responsibility to Kosovo does not end with the elections and the establishment of the structures of provisional self-government ... <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1244 (1999)</a> must be strictly implemented until an agreement on the final status of Kosovo is reached. The need for a continued and substantive United Nations presence in post-election Kosovo, supported by other international agencies and interested parties, is obvious ... [T]he eventual termination of the United Nations presence ... must be gradual and carefully structured to bolster, not undermine, the painstaking progress achieved." (<i><a href="../html/S-PV-4350.html">S/PV.4350</a>, p.16</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">We stand by this.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa08">We look forward to UNMIK's facilitating a political process designed to determine Kosovo's future status, taking into account the Rambouillet accords, as mandated by the Security Council under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. Continuing dialogue with Belgrade on this is important.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01"> I would now like to comment briefly in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">The Permanent Representative of Belgium will shortly deliver a statement on behalf of the European Union Presidency, with which Ireland is in full agreement. My delegation takes the opportunity of this meeting, perhaps the last public Council meeting on this item before Kosovo-wide elections on 17 November, to thank Mr. Haekkerup for his excellent work as Special Representative and to commend him and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in preparing for the elections and in implementing other aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa03">The draft presidential statement which will be delivered after this meeting confirms the importance attached by the Security Council to their efforts in this regard. As we have said many times before, all communities in Kosovo must work towards achieving a multi-ethnic society based on respect for minority and human rights. We join the call of many other delegations today for Kosovo Serbs to participate fully in the election process in order to ensure that they, in turn, are fully represented in the future Kosovo. We, too, urge the authorities in Belgrade to encourage Kosovo Serbs to vote in the upcoming elections and to reaffirm the multi-ethnic character of Kosovo by participating in all aspects of its life. In doing so, we stress that the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government is an interim document and does not in any way prejudice the future status of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa04">The draft presidential statement also makes clear that the international community will not countenance any form of extremism. In addition to the efforts of UNMIK and KFOR, Kosovo parties and civic leaders must do everything possible to encourage a positive climate for Serb participation in the elections and in daily life in Kosovo, before and after.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa05">We welcome the intensification of relations between UNMIK and Belgrade, and we encourage continued cooperation, including in relation to the return of refugees and internally displaced persons. We also encourage further progress in relation to missing persons and political prisoners. In this regard, we would be grateful if Mr. Haekkerup could clarify the position regarding the remaining political detainees in Serbia.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa06">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa07">I give the floor to the representative of Yugoslavia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sahovi</span> <span class="nation">Yugoslavia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">It is a great pleasure for me to see you, Sir, presiding over Security Council deliberations, and I wish you every success in carrying out your important tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report, which we examined with immense interest. I would also like to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Haekkerup, for his statement and his assessment of the current situation in Kosovo and Metohija.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Very recently, Security Council members had the opportunity to hear in detail the Yugoslav position on the situation in Kosovo and Metohija from Mr. Nebojsa Covi, Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia and head of the Coordinating Centre for Kosovo. I will therefore restrict myself to making just a few comments on some of the most topical issues, among which, of course, the elections of 17 November are central.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">An important pre-electoral phase -- the registration of voters -- has been completed, in what, we believe, to be a satisfactory manner. As we consider it vital that the United Nations Mission in Kosovo and Metohija successfully implement its mandate, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia made a maximum contribution to the registration process. This was amply demonstrated by the exceptionally good response of Kosovo Serbs to the registration appeal, particularly after the highest representatives of Serbia and Yugoslavia called on them to register. According to the available data, some 170,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians responded to the call -- a far larger figure than the one often wrongly quoted as representing the number of Serbs and other minorities living in the province.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">The biggest challenge, however -- the elections themselves -- lies ahead. The Secretary-General has reported that the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) sees the next step -- the participation of Kosovo Serbs and other minorities -- as being critical to both the legitimacy of the elections and the Mission's goal of bringing about inclusive provisional self-government. We entirely share that view.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">In recent months, ever since the elections were scheduled, my Government has repeatedly emphasized that the security situation and freedom of movement, as well as conditions for the return of internally displaced persons, must be improved so that Serbs and other non-Albanian voters can participate and give legitimacy to the elections. Unfortunately, the situation with regard to those three issues, as well as to other problems, such as the fate of missing persons, is still very grave.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">In this connection, I would like again to refer to the Secretary-General's report and emphasize some of his comments. The Secretary-General pointed out that, in the reporting period, the number of ethnically motivated attacks against Kosovo minority communities increased, and included incidents of intimidation, harassment, assault, arson and murder, an alarming number of them involving the use of weapons. To claim that it is imperative for all communities to participate in the elections if they wish to have a say in the daily running of their affairs is simply not enough. Conditions have to be created for all to be able to campaign and go to the polling stations without being afraid of what may happen to them. In addition, I should like to recall once again that only 80 Serbs out of more than 250,000 displaced and expelled non-Albanians have been able to return to Kosovo and Metohija in the past two years.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">I should also like to draw the attention of the Council to the assessment, in paragraph 61 of the report (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-926.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/926</a>), that,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg021-bk02-pa09">"While the majority have certain responsibilities towards the minority communities, the latter also have a crucial obligation to participate in the UNMIK-led election process."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">It is our understanding that in democracies -- even aspiring ones -- the majority have the primary responsibility for ensuring minority rights. Those who were in government in my country until not so long ago -- actually, until one year ago today -- grossly neglected this concept, and the consequences of that neglect are now very obvious and very great. In this context, we believe that calling on Albanian leaders to fully contribute to ensuring security, freedom of movement and the right of minority communities to return would constitute an essential step towards our common goals. Furthermore, we consider it necessary to send a clear message that the forthcoming elections should not in any way precipitate the decision on the final status of Kosovo and Metohija.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is repeatedly called on to encourage the Serbian community in Kosovo and Metohija to take part in the elections. Regrettably, for the reasons that I have stated, Yugoslavia is not yet in a position to take a final decision as to whether or not to encourage Kosovo Serb participation in the elections. While there is a genuine desire to support Serb participation, we believe that better conditions must be created before we can responsibly do so.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa12">The message that has come from today's Security Council meeting, however, is extremely important and positive and provides us with a basis to advocate, in the coming days and weeks, Serb participation in the elections. For that I am grateful to Security Council members.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa13">On a more optimistic note, I would like to stress the steady improvement in the relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the international community, in particular UNMIK, in working towards the common goal of gradually stabilizing the situation in Kosovo and Metohija. Furthermore, we recently concluded an agreement with the United Nations on the status of the United Nations liaison office in Belgrade, and my Government expects to proceed quickly to institutionalize cooperation with UNMIK by concluding an agreement on the status of UNMIK's Office in Belgrade, as well as a comprehensive status-of-mission agreement. We would also like to intensify cooperation with the international presence in Kosovo and Metohija on a range of concrete issues, including the implementation of the UNMIK Regulation on the Prohibition of Terrorism and Related Offences, of last June, as well as concerning related problems, including those of organized crime, trafficking in drugs and persons and the illegal flow of arms.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa14">Finally, allow me to reiterate once again Yugoslavia's full commitment to the consistent implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and our readiness to invest further efforts in this direction. We are willing and able to fully contribute to improving the situation and to making it possible to hold viable elections next month. However, the greatest responsibility in this respect lies with UNMIK which, as the Special Representative has repeatedly noted, is in charge of administering Kosovo and Metohija.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01"> I thank the representative of Yugoslavia for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">I now call on the representative of Belgium, whom I invite to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Ruyt</span> <span class="nation">Belgium</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated countries of Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as Iceland and Liechtenstein, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries belonging to the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">Above all, I should like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the Council presidency during a month that will be tightly packed and filled with challenges, all of which we know you will be able to meet. I should also like to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, for all of his comprehensive and regular briefings. We should also like to congratulate him for the scope of the work he has carried out, along with the men and women of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), in order to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, and we would reassure them of our support in their coming tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">The European Union will indeed continue to assist UNMIK in its efforts to develop effective, multi-ethnic and democratic provisional institutions of self-government which meet the European Union's standards, particularly as regards human rights and good governance. The same applies to everything concerning the implementation of law and order through strengthening the police force and developing an effective and objective judicial system. Finally, it will support UNMIK's efforts in setting up the foundations for sustainable economic development in the context of a market economy.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">Among these important aims, recent developments concerning the preparation of the elections to be held on 17 November obviously draw our attention. The European Union welcomes the registration of a considerable number of Serbian electors in Kosovo over recent weeks. Allow me to emphasize, yet again, the importance we attribute to the massive participation in the ballot by all the communities in Kosovo so as to ensure that they are suitably represented in the new democratically elected institutions, as pointed out by previous speakers. We also welcome the certification of the "Return" coalition of Serbian political parties for the future elections. The positive role played by Belgrade in the registration of electors and political parties should now be followed by a clear appeal to the Serbian community in Kosovo to take part in the elections. This is highly important.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">Lastly, sustained attention and collaboration of all the parties are still necessary to resolve the issues of security, missing persons and the return of displaced persons. As the Secretary-General's Special Representative said, considerable progress has been made in this area, despite the problems that persist. Close collaboration between Belgrade, UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) remains vital in this connection.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">The situation of Mitrovica is still of the utmost sensitivity. We would encourage the Albanian political leaders to take all the confidence-building measures possible to allow the return to Mitrovica of the non-Albanian communities. We would likewise encourage the Serbian political leaders to take similar confidence-building steps to enable Albanian families to live and work in peace in the north of Mitrovica and the north of Kosovo. Generally speaking, and to avoid any fresh misunderstandings, the European Union recommends that the important decisions directly affecting the population of Mitrovica and northern Kosovo be accompanied by an intensive media campaign.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">We hope that The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia continues, for its part, to take decisive steps towards the national reconciliation of all its communities. The Security Council, in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1371(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1371 (2001)</a>, has associated itself with the efforts made by the Member States and international organizations concerned to support application of the Framework Agreement and, in this respect, has energetically supported the establishment of a multinational security presence. The European Union would encourage the Parliament and all the democratic forces of The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to continue to commit themselves to the further legislative work needed to implement the Framework Agreement. The European Union would point out that full and fair implementation of the Framework Agreement by all the parties concerned is the only guarantee of a return to peace, of national reconciliation and of rapprochement with the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">The deadline of 17 November will soon be upon us. These elections, and the democratic institutions to emerge from them, will provide impetus for the advancement of implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. Even if, for the past few weeks, our attention is mainly drawn to this event, it is nonetheless only one stage in a process that will require even closer attention on the part of the international community. More than ever, collaboration, cooperation and partnership will be the watchwords of our future endeavours. The European Union is making this one of its main priorities.</p>

	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01"> I thank the representative of Belgium for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">I now call on the representative of Albania, whom I invite to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nesho</span> <span class="nation">Albania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, please allow me to thank you for the professional way in which you have conducted the work of the Security Council. We appreciate the close cooperation and contribution that you and your delegation have provided to all United Nations delegations. In addition, I would like to commend your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of France, Ambassador Levitte, for his excellent performance last month and, in particular, for the swift adoption of two important resolutions, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1368(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1368 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>, on the subject of international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">The Albanian delegation wishes to express its satisfaction with the participation of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, in today's debate. On this occasion, we wish to thank him for the excellent work he has undertaken towards the fulfilment and implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the building of democratic institutions in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">With all of the problems on the ground, the achievements made so far in Kosovo clearly speak for the commendable work of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR). We believe that the general elections will once again demonstrate the results made so far and will show the great and far-sighted work of the Security Council as well, which has not only managed and conducted the crisis in Kosovo but has also made possible the creation of a multi-ethnic and democratic society in an environment where hatred and war are disguised as permanent ghosts trailing living beings.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">The general elections in Kosovo will ultimately lead to the establishment of legitimate authorities in Kosovo, who will have the opportunity to present and express the free will of the people and to protect the democratic principles of a multi-ethnic society and the rights of minorities and so forth. Therefore, this election requires the full participation of all people of Kosovo -- Albanians, Serbs and others -- in order to build their future. The process will be the first of the phases necessary to finally remove suspicion and fear, for the future of Kosovar society and for the establishment of an environment that will generate peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">Unfortunately, the huge building process in Kosovo proposed by the Security Council and being implemented by UNMIK has not been well understood, judged on the basis of petty and narrow interests, put in doubt by the passions of both sides; even some leaders could be ready to sacrifice this process because of their power interests and old nationalistic spirit.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">We understand Mr. Haekkerup's and UNMIK's difficult task in accomplishing their objectives and their necessary compromises in an environment in which one side has not yet shown that it is able to fully respect a multi-ethnic society and implement all obligations deriving from that, while the other side does not want to face the reality that Serbs are only 5 per cent of the entire Kosovo population and are therefore a minority, continuing to regard Kosovo as an old privilege, like a feudal dowry, where passion for land and territory decides the future of people and society.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">As we understand the situation in Kosovo, the Albanians of Kosovo fought against genocide and oppression with the aspiration of joining Western civilization. The Albanians of Kosovo did not need, and still do not need, help from terrorism to gain recognition for those legitimate rights that were supported by the international community and the Security Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">We can say that the people of Kosovo, since 11 September 2001, have been among the first to join the international community in the fight -- without any compromise -- against international terrorism, while other leaders in the Balkans, who call them terrorists and diffuse the idea of terrorism in Kosovo, stand loyal to their national agendas and all ideas about the future of the Balkans, and even dare to criticize the previous United States Administration and the international community for humanitarian intervention in the Balkans.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">In conclusion, the Albanian Government fully supports the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Haekkerup, and UNMIK. Albania believes that successfully holding the general election in Kosovo on 17 November 2001 is a very important process that should be supported by the entire international community. The Albanian Government, as always, will make its contribution to the successful implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and the preservation of peace and stability in the region.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">First and foremost, I wish to give thanks for the support given by the members of the Security Council for the Mission. I will certainly bring to the members of the Mission -- the men and women working there -- the Council's kind words about what they are doing.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">Some aspects that came up in this part of the interventions are very important to address. In particular, security and violence in Kosovo were very much in the picture.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">I might perhaps explain a little more about developments over the last year.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">Criminality in general is high in Kosovo. It is also high compared with the rest of the region, but not extremely high compared with the rest of the region. We have had a development whereby violence has been decreasing; ethnic violence, especially, has gone down by 40 per cent. So the more serious crimes have been decreasing, even if the overall level of criminality generally is very high. This is not to say that we have reached a level that is good. Ethnic violence is still far too high. It is an exception to the region, in the sense that generally ethnic violence is not high. So we should continue our efforts. But even if we have 50,000 KFOR soldiers and 8,000 UNMIK police Kosovo Police Service officers, that is not enough to stop violence. Of course, as we improve our capabilities we will do better, especially with the creation of pillar I, the justice and police pillar, and the additional resources will be helpful in achieving better results.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">But it is also a process involving the people. When it is said that the security of Serbs is threatened, that is right. They have to live in enclaves; they have to be under protection. Of course, one can, as an individual, take a risk as a Serb and walk down the streets of Pristina, but it is a risk. It is a smaller risk for a woman than for a man, but it is still there. In any case, there is the risk of being pointed at, because it is a small community, as the Council knows, and everybody knows everybody else, so people might point at a Kosovo Serb. What we are still lacking to some extent is having some Albanians come forward in that situation and ask "So what?" But this is also starting to happen, and it is the change in people's mentality that is exactly what this whole process is about. There are a lot of good people in Kosovo, both Serbs and Albanians, who used to work together, live together, know each other and be friends, and they are gradually coming to the fore. We want these people back, and they should be able to set the agenda, not the people who committed the atrocities in the past. The situation is changing, but it takes time and patience. We have to continue and sustain this effort.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">I would also like to express thanks for the good remarks about strengthening our law enforcement capabilities. I especially thank member countries for giving us the capabilities, especially in the area of organized crime. We have tried to pass many regulations in the past half year, adding legislative or judicial possibilities for addressing organized crime and terrorism, arms smuggling, trafficking in women and so forth. But getting the right legislation is only half of it. The other half is getting the capabilities. Here the creation of an organized crime bureau is essential. It will give us the possibility of turning intelligence into evidence. Members must realize that it will take some time to infiltrate these organizations, follow them and know what their pattern of actions is before we get results. But the fact that we are building the capabilities now bodes well for the future. If we do not do it now, we shall not be able to address organized crime further down the road.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">There were also some comments, especially from the Yugoslav Ambassador, on the security situation. I fully agree that the security situation and the freedom of movement of Kosovo Serbs and some members of the other communities is not good enough, and our entire aim is really to change that through the means that we have. But this will not prevent them from safely participating in the election, because we will organize the election in such a way that it will be possible for Kosovo Serbs in our communities who might feel threatened to go and vote without fear; we will simply organize it so that they can vote in the enclaves where they live and work.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">So it is not in that way that there is a security threat to participation in the elections. It is very important to underline that. There will be -- and we may already see the first signs -- during the election campaign, and maybe shortly after it, an increase in political violence, but that will not only be inter-ethnic. That will certainly also be Albanian-Albanian violence associated with the process of having elections. Nevertheless, we will do our utmost to avoid it. We are putting many resources into trying to make campaigning Serb politicians from Serbia proper, Kosovo Serb politicians and Albanian politicians as secure as possible during this election campaign. We are dedicated to that. We should be able to deliver the necessary security and cooperation with KFOR.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">Ambassador Durrant had a question about the flow of arms into Kosovo. We have done a lot to address this. We passed the regulation on illegal weapons possession. Both KFOR and UNMIK police -- KPS -- have done a lot to deal with this. I have to say -- and I know that you know this -- that this is an area where multi-ethnic cooperation works very well. Not so long ago we had a big weapons cache in the Pec region, a truck coming into Kosovo. I do not think it was meant to stay in Kosovo; it transited Kosovo and most likely would have continued and the weapons would have ended up in Macedonia. But it came through Montenegro, from Bosnia. Fortunately, police in Bosnia have been able to get their hands on the people behind this. Of course the weapons came from different locations inside the region and outside the region. So it is not a Kosovo phenomenon. In this case it was very clear that Kosovo was only a transit area for these weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">But this case underlines the importance of working together, trying to address trafficking in arms and in women, and of course organized crime in general. Therefore I wish to stress that we are committed to it; we will continue our efforts. It is one of our priorities, to try to stop this sort of thing.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa11">On returns, I would just make one remark. It is pointed out that in two years we have seen only 80 persons return. But it has to be clear that these are the first returns, and that is the important thing. I had discussions with Kosovo Albanian leaders, and they supported the principle of return. The Interim Administrative Council made a decision on a declaration on the principle of returns, and we now see the first returns.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa12">It is a fragile process. It is very important that we do not get a negative response from the Kosovo Albanian population, and therefore we try to handle it carefully, knowing that if the first returns fail it will be much more difficult to have returns on a larger scale. Up to now it has worked out very well, and I appreciate that everybody understands the sensitivity of this. On the other hand, one should never doubt the commitment of UNMIK to continue returns, and on a larger scale. We will certainly be ready to put forward our plans as we approach the next season of returns.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa13">I would like to thank Ukraine for the remarks about providing training for civil emergencies for the KPC. It is a very important process to develop that capability.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa14">I would also like to say that Ukraine had -- I think it was a Norwegian metaphor: sailors should know where the harbour is. I fully agree with that. But I have to say that when I accepted to be the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for this mission I had to realize, reading <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, that that was not the case. The resolution of course has a goal, but there is no answer to the question about what the final settlement is going to be. This is what makes the mission interesting and challenging: to move toward the harbour without knowing precisely where we will land -- but getting closer to the coastline. I think that is exactly what provisional self-government is about.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa15">Finally, I would like to underline that, as the Yugoslav Ambassador clearly said, provisional self-government does not prejudice the final status. It is very clear, in how we have defined the powers of the provisional self-government, that questions about the final status or the sovereignty are not part of the mandate. That is a reserved power and will be dealt with when we come to the final political settlement. I want to underline that point so that there is no doubt about what is the position in that regard.</p>
