	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the First General Elections for the President and Members of the House of Representatives of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, held from 20 May through 9 June 2005, and considers that they were competently and transparently conducted, as noted by the International Observer Team. The Council congratulates the Autonomous Bougainville Government and the people of Bougainville on this achievement and takes note that these elections, which reflect the expressed will of the people of Bougainville, mark a significant and historical landmark in the Bougainville peace process and make it possible to enter into a new stage for further implementation of the peace agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Council further welcomes the inauguration of the Autonomous Bougainville Government in its full capacity and affirms its continuing support for the people of Bougainville.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Council urges those who did not participate in the electoral process to respect the outcome of the elections and support without delay the Autonomous Bougainville Government in its peacebuilding efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Council pays tribute to the efforts of the Government of Papua New Guinea and the Bougainville leaders for fully implementing the Bougainville Peace Agreement. The Council commends the support by the international community, in particular the significant contributions made by the countries in the region and partners in the donor community, as well as the United Nations. The Council also expresses its appreciation for the commendable role played by the Commonwealth and the Pacific Islands Forum in dispatching electoral observers for the smooth conduct of the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Council notes with satisfaction that the performance of the United Nations Observer Mission in Bougainville (UNOMB), as well as that of its preceding United Nations Political Office in Bougainville (UNPOB), manifested that a small United Nations special political mission with a clearly defined mandate can make a critical contribution to a regional conflict resolution effort in an efficient and effective manner.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Council encourages the ongoing support and commitment by the international community to the efforts by the Government of Papua New Guinea and the people of Bougainville in pursuit of their economic and social development, as well as for a sustainable peace in the region."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-23.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/23</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
