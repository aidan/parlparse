<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk03">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Kazykhanov" nation="Kazakhstan" language="">
	Mr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa01">At the outset, I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the work of the Organization, which covers the multifaceted activities of all United Nations institutions. Indeed, this has been a most challenging, crucial and fruitful year in United Nations history. The Secretary-General and the Organization have taken bold and practical steps in several important areas -- namely, security, development and human rights, as well as institutional reforms.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa02">Two weeks ago, we all witnessed the historic United Nations summit. Its outcome document, in the words of the Secretary-General, is "a good instrument to streamline the United Nations to meet the many new challenges of the twenty-first century". Now, we must take coordinated action to fully utilize these new opportunities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Kazakhstan stresses an urgent need to deal with global challenges to disarmament and non-proliferation. As we all know, the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons failed to set up a balanced and comprehensive mechanism that would strengthen the international non-proliferation regime and facilitate the attainment of the goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. More disturbing, however, is the lack of clear recommendations on the burning issues of non-proliferation and disarmament in the outcome document of the 2005 United Nations summit.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa04">Today, challenges and threats, including those involving the uncontrolled spread of nuclear weapons and the risk of their finding a way into the hands of terrorists, have grown manyfold. The elimination of such threats requires joint, well-coordinated and effective action at all levels. We believe that international cooperation in fighting terrorism should be pursued in strict compliance with the norms of international law, and we look forward to the early completion of a comprehensive convention against international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa05">We support further the universalization and enhancement of anti-terrorist treaty mechanisms. The signing by Kazakhstan of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism is a practical reaffirmation of that position.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa06">In January 2005, Kazakhstan hosted a meeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) of the Security Council. We consider it very significant that the CTC meeting was convened jointly with the Commonwealth of Independent States in the heart of the Eurasian continent. Counter-terrorism activities in our region are closely linked with efforts to prevent the trafficking of drugs, arms and human beings. Most of the region's organizations pay special attention to the development of cooperation in counter-terrorism activities. We believe that that the experience we have gained in the process might prove useful for the CTC.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa07">For Kazakhstan, the proposed Peacebuilding Commission is a step in the right direction. As its main mission, it should strive to avert the recurrence of situations when the lack of a peacebuilding strategy results in the escalation of internal conflicts and, ultimately, in the further loss by States of their capacity to perform their sovereign functions effectively and responsibly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa08">Our country is actively working on issues related to the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA). CICA is a venue for an exchange of views on Asian security. It is encouraging to see that the CICA process is gaining momentum and has, indeed, become an important tool of preventive diplomacy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa09">Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) should become a central element of the international community's efforts to put an end to poverty, conflict, instability and terrorism. Economic and social development, as well as international cooperation, must become key elements in the preventive approach to collective security. The second national report on the MDGs, recently released in close cooperation with the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, indicates that our nation has already achieved a number of goals, especially as regards universal education, the eradication of poverty and gender promotion. We are also close to reaching important targets in some other areas.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa10">We commend the United Nations and its specialized agencies for their assistance in addressing the effects of environmental disasters in the Aral Sea area and in the Semipalatinsk region. Problems in those regions are global in scope, as they have a negative effect on the health and livelihood of people in other regions of the globe. In this context, we request the international community to support a draft resolution at the current session of the General Assembly on the Semipalatinsk region, sponsored by Kazakhstan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa11">We believe that the special needs of landlocked developing countries should be taken fully into account, as outlined in the Almaty Programme of Action. For that reason, Kazakhstan is satisfied that the outcome document of the 2005 United Nations summit contains provisions on improved transit transport capacity of landlocked countries and their access to world markets. In order to stimulate the implementation process of the Almaty Programme of Action, the Government of Kazakhstan, together with the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, held a High-level Meeting on the Role of International, Regional and Subregional Organizations for the Implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action, in Almaty last March. We consider it to be a significant contribution to the implementation of this Programme through strengthened partnerships of all parties concerned, including international, regional and subregional organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa12">Kazakhstan believes that the rule of law is of paramount importance in international relations. We closely link Kazakhstan's development to the further democratization of our society, based on respect for the rights and freedoms of every individual. Therefore, Kazakhstan supports the strengthening of United Nations democratic institutions and human rights machinery. We sincerely hope that these changes are designed to promote the rights and freedoms of citizens and to ensure compliance with the principles of non-interference and sovereign equality of States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa13">While supporting the reform process, we strongly believe that priority should be given to the General Assembly as the main deliberative, decision-making and representative body of our Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa14">My delegation would like to reiterate that such a sensitive issue as the reform of the Security Council should be resolved on the basis of the broadest possible agreement. We are convinced that the enlargement of the Security Council, in accordance with the principle of equitable geographical representation and on the basis of the contributions of States concerned towards development of the world economy and global security, serves the interests of Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa15">Kazakhstan welcomes the establishment of a standing committee on regional organizations. We hope that improved collaboration of the United Nations with regional organizations will contribute to the collective security system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa16">Inter-faith dialogue is an integral part of efforts to promote the culture of peace and dialogue among civilizations and to advance the common values outlined in the Millennium Declaration. We believe that the informal meeting on interreligious dialogue and cooperation for peace, held within the framework of the 2005 summit in New York and cosponsored by Kazakhstan, made a substantial contribution to enhanced interfaith dialogue.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa17">We are grateful to the international community for lending support to our country's initiatives in this area. Kazakhstan has initiated a Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. The second Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions is to be held next year in Astana. We will discuss the topic of religions, society and international security. Kazakhstan expects representatives of other emerging forums, such as the Alliance of Civilizations, to take part in the Congress.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa18">Our people know that development, security and human rights, the three main pillars of today's world, are not abstract concepts. We realize that eventual success in attaining our objectives will be assured through the mobilization of resources and maximization of support from all members of the international community. Kazakhstan is actively and responsibly involved in all major United Nations activities and in recent years has begun to shoulder more responsibility by making voluntary financial contributions to United Nations funds and programmes.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Zhang Yishan" nation="China" language="Chinese">
	Mr. Zhang Yishan (China)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I would like to begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his report on the work of the United Nations. The report reviews the work over the past year and contains an array of recommendations on ways to address the challenges facing us today. I would like to focus on three points in connection with the recent summit.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa02">First, on the implementation of the outcome document of the summit, this year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. The outcome document, which the summit adopted two weeks ago, reflects a common understanding on the part of all sides and points out the direction for the future work of the United Nations. Currently, the most important task is to implement the outcome document effectively, so as to translate the words into reality. This is a daunting challenge that requires the full cooperation of all. The outcome document involves many aspects. Therefore, its implementation should proceed on all fronts but should also follow an order of priorities. While the focus should be on certain issues, efforts in other areas should proceed in parallel.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa03">We believe that, in the implementation of the outcome document, development should occupy the primary and core position. Maximum efforts should be made to meet the needs of developing countries, especially African countries, in order to inject new vitality into development efforts and to enable developing countries to derive genuine benefit from the summit.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa04">China supports the rapid establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and believes that it should begin functioning as soon as possible in order to set up an effective link among the United Nations efforts in the areas of peacekeeping, post-conflict reconstruction and development. The agreement to establish this Commission is a major achievement of the summit. It will play a positive role in peaceful reconstruction in conflict areas. We call for the completion of this task as soon as possible.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa05">Terrorism is a common threat to all countries. We support an early completion of the negotiations on a comprehensive convention against terrorism and stand ready to work actively with all countries toward this end.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa06">As for the reform of the Secretariat, we look forward to the relevant report, which is to be submitted by the Secretary-General. The necessary reform of the internal management of the Secretariat will be conducive to the improvement of our Organization's efficiency, so as to make it better able to serve the interests of Member States. Reform measures should aim both at enhancing the managerial capability of the Secretariat and at ensuring that the rights of Member States are safeguarded. We hope that discussions will continue on the report of the Secretary-General in an effort to achieve consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa07">The summit agreed to the establishment of a Human Rights Council. However, great divergences remain over its specific model, size and composition. The causes for these divergences have to do with the politicization of human rights issues and with double standards. We hope that in the coming consultations, States can take a constructive approach to reduce differences, increase common understanding and find appropriate solutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa08">There remain divergences of views on some specific issues in the outcome document. It is impossible for differences of principle to be resolved any time soon. It is of key importance that all sides accommodate the concerns of others and press on with patient consultations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa09">Secondly, regarding peace and security, this past year has, as the report says, witnessed both progress and setbacks, not just for the United Nations but also for the world. The United Nations continues to play an important role in helping to solve the questions of Iraq, the Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Afghanistan and Haiti. Success has been achieved in Sierra Leone, Bougainville and Timor Leste. However, in many regions, attempts to resolve tensions have led to stalemates, and there have even been relapses.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa10">The political transitional process in Iraq has entered a key stage, with progress in developing the constitution. The parties concerned should expeditiously improve the security situation in Iraq, enhance the representativity and inclusiveness of the Iraqi political process and help the Iraqi people reconstruct their country. The United Nations should play an active role in the preparations for the general elections and in the promotion of national reconciliation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa11">The peace process in the Middle East has recently witnessed positive developments. With the cooperation of the Palestinian side, Israel has successfully completed its withdrawal from Gaza and areas in the West Bank. This is of positive significance for the advancement of the talks between the parties and the resolution of the conflict. We hope that both parties will seize this opportune moment and put the Israeli and Palestinian peace process back on the track of the road map as soon as possible.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="italicline-tookchair" id="pg004-bk01">
	Mr. Akram (Pakistan),  Vice President, took the chair.
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Zhang Yishan" nation="China" language="Chinese">
	Mr. Zhang Yishan (China)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa01">During the past year, United Nations peacekeeping operations encountered challenges on an unprecedented scale. All countries, especially developed countries, should provide greater political support to the United Nations, in terms of troops and resources, so that its peacekeeping operations can be carried out effectively.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa02">China supports efforts by the United Nations to enhance its rapid deployment and strategic preparations capacity and endorses efforts under the guidance of the Security Council to fully mobilize the resources of the regional organizations concerned.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Thirdly, on the question of development, the Secretary-General again emphasizes in his report the importance of development. As he says in his report,</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg004-bk02-pa04">"Our generation is the first to have the knowledge and resources to eradicate extreme poverty, so there is no longer any excuse for leaving over a billion of our fellow human beings in that state." (<i><a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-60-1.pdf">A/60/1</a>, para. 4</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is a solemn commitment made by all countries at the summit and doing so is the embodiment of the hope that hundreds of millions of people have placed in the United Nations. Today there is an urgent need to further deepen reforms in order to make the international economic system and rules more fair and just and more reflective of the concerns of developing countries, so as to push the economic globalization process in the direction of balance, universal benefit and win-win situations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa06">It is therefore necessary to create a favourable financial and trade environment for developing countries, reduce their debt burdens and strengthen their capacity to participate in international economic affairs so that they can truly benefit from economic globalization. At the same time, developing countries should pool their efforts, choose development models in the light of their national conditions, strengthen South-South cooperation and gradually improve their disadvantageous position with respect to economic globalization. A broad consensus has already been reached on the need to strengthen multilateralism in the role of the United Nations -- a point that was reaffirmed in the outcome document.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa07">After 60 years of trials and tribulations, the importance of the role of the United Nations in peace and development is self-evident. The tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean in December 2004 was a calamity of unprecedented proportions, affecting 14 countries on two continents. Recently, one hurricane after another hit the southern United States, causing destruction and casualties that exceeded predictions. However, in both cases, Governments, international organizations, including United Nations agencies, and members of civil society provided assistance to the best of their ability and swiftly mobilized resources on a massive scale to provide humanitarian relief. That proves that the international community has the ability to take collective actions promptly and effectively to address major challenges.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The future role of the United Nations will depend on collective efforts and contributions to multilateralism by all parties and on efforts to honour the commitments made at the summit to United Nations reform. Only thus can the United Nations improve its effectiveness, strengthen its leading role in international affairs and consolidate its capacity to address all manner of threats and challenges.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Sardenberg" nation="Brazil" language="">
	Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa01">The discussion of the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization (<i><a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-60-1.pdf">A/60/1</a></i>) provides us, on a yearly basis, with a highly valuable opportunity to take stock of developments affecting the international situation and of United Nations actions to deal with them. The Secretary-General's report once again provides the General Assembly with a comprehensive and very carefully crafted account of challenges met, tasks accomplished and goals remaining to be achieved in our collective endeavour. Through it, he shares with us his keen perception of current realities, of threats currently before us and of how best to deal with them collectively and in the most effective and least individually taxing manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa02">This particular session of the General Assembly is, in a way, the culmination of that process. A few weeks ago, our political leaders gathered here at the High-level Plenary Meeting and agreed on a set of goals aimed at the promotion of economic and social development and at the institutional reform of the Organization. In many cases, agreements were reached on the basis of broad principles, and they will have to be fleshed out by the General Assembly during the course of the substantive debate of this session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Even though the final results of the High-level Plenary Meeting were not as far-reaching as the majority of Member States had expected, its outcome document (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf">resolution 60/1</a></i>) serves as a minimum platform for our continued efforts to promote the much-needed reform and strengthening of the Organization. That will require us to adopt a pronouncedly forward-looking approach to the work of this session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa04">In terms of development, the international community has recognized that its current efforts have been insufficient and that there is a pressing need to redouble those efforts in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the agreed deadline of 2015. A substantial increase in official development assistance is essential, and innovative sources of financing for development are urgently needed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa05">As President Da Silva said in his statement before the High-level Plenary Meeting,</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg005-bk01-pa06">"We must take immediate and courageous steps. The resources available for fighting poverty and hunger must be significantly expanded; we need to provide development opportunities to poor countries" (<i><a href="../pdf/A-60-PV.5.pdf">A/60/PV.5</a>, p. 16</i>).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa07">He went on to say that developed countries must realize that that additional effort is not only fair, but absolutely necessary.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa08">That necessity is further underscored by the perception -- now universally acknowledged -- that the question of development is intrinsically linked to international peace and security. More must be done to promote and facilitate cooperation among developing countries themselves. South-South cooperation does not replace the traditional forms of North-South cooperation, but rather complements it. South-South cooperation modalities often result in more adequate solutions to challenges related to development, as such challenges tend to be faced by most developing countries. However, more resources will be needed to ensure that South-South cooperation -- which is already a growing field -- can be sufficiently expanded to ensure a scale that allows for the attainment of the MDGs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa09">In striving to promote social and economic development, we must also focus our attention on cooperation in the field of science and technology, as provided for in the outcome document. International actions in that field must be aimed at ensuring improved access to scientific knowledge and the transfer to developing countries of technologies that are financially accessible and adapted to their circumstances, particularly in the case of the least developed countries. Brazil is now considering organizing a Brazil-Africa technological forum, open to the participation of Governments, civil society, the private sector and financial institutions, aimed at promoting cooperation projects in the areas of science, technology and education.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa10">With regard to the promotion of peace and security, one threat that affects the international community in its entirety is the scourge of terrorism. These unjustifiable acts victimize innocent civilians in rich and poor countries alike, not only directly -- through the death and devastation caused by the attacks themselves -- but also indirectly, by threatening to undermine the achievements of our societies in the promotion and protection of human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa11">Our delegation supports the Secretary-General's efforts to finalize a common strategy to deal with this menace in full accordance with internationally agreed principles and standards of human rights law and international humanitarian law. We also remain hopeful that the General Assembly will be able to come to an agreement on a comprehensive convention against terrorism, even if the precise definition of terrorism continues to elude us.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa12">A major task before us will be to carry out the process of institutional reform. In the outcome document, our leaders provided for the establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission in order to fill the institutional void that currently exists between the perspective of peace and security and the perspective of development in dealing with situations. The two perspectives are, of course, interrelated. Now we must set up the Commission's standing organizational committee and elect its members in order to meet the deadline to make the Commission operational by the end of this year. In considering the composition of that committee, the General Assembly must be careful not to curtail the participation of countries from the developing world, particularly as we have already been playing an increasing role in the field.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa13">Our political leaders also resolved to create a Human Rights Council and have tasked us, under the able guidance of the President of the General Assembly, to engage in open, transparent and inclusive negotiations to establish its mandate, modalities, functions, size, composition, membership, working methods and procedures. As a measure to reinforce the structures and mechanisms of the Organization in the human rights field, it is imperative that that Council be established on the basis of the principles of universality, dialogue and non-selectivity. In this respect, we should also be careful not to set up a Council so small that it might compromise the ability to ensure balanced and adequate representation of all legal systems or the presence of countries of the developing world, where the issue of human rights is of keen interest to Governments and public alike.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa14">We must also reinforce, adapt and update the Organization's current structures. Brazil is deeply interested in the process of the revitalization of the General Assembly. More than ever, the Assembly is needed to provide leadership and political guidance to the Organization as a whole. In successfully carrying out the tasks set for it by the Plenary Meeting, the Assembly will, in fact, be re-establishing its centrality in the work of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa15">The Economic and Social Council must regain its dynamism and influential role. It must be a forum for discussion and for the identification of common ground among the objectives of sustainable development, the eradication of hunger and poverty, good governance and the reduction of inequalities, which are exacerbated by the process of globalization. As is recognized in paragraph 53 of the outcome document (<i>resolution 60</i>), early reform of the Security Council is "an essential element of our overall effort to reform the United Nations". We are all convinced of the need to make the Council more representative and democratic.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa16">As the Brazilian Foreign Minister, Ambassador Celso Amorim, stated in the 9th meeting, at the opening of the general debate:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg005-bk01-pa17">"At this historic juncture, no Security Council reform effort will be meaningful unless it contemplates an increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent seats, with developing countries from Africa, Latin America and Asia included in both categories. We cannot accept the perpetuation of imbalances that run contrary to the very spirit of multilateralism."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa18">We trust that all those who are genuinely interested in a true reform of the Organization -- the overwhelming majority of the membership -- will continue to strive for such an expansion of the Security Council. It is clear to all that no reform of the United Nations will be complete without it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa19">With regard to management reform, we are convinced that the Secretariat must be efficient, effective and accountable. Its staff should work in a culture of transparency, accountability and integrity, as well as in accordance with the provisions of Article 100 of the Charter. In the recruitment of staff, due regard must be paid to the principle of equitable geographical distribution at all levels. Coordination within the United Nations system in the fight against hunger and poverty -- the first Millennium Development Goal -- must be urgently improved. Procurement policies must effectively incorporate, in a more balanced way, suppliers from all regions, especially developing countries. Brazil also supports the strengthening of oversight in the United Nations by ensuring the operational independence of the Office of Internal Oversight Services.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa20">Finally, we must point out that one major lacunas in the final outcome document is, of course, the omission of disarmament and non-proliferation. Despite the lack of agreement that led to such a regrettable result, we must emphasize that both items remain a high priority for Brazil and for the international community, and that they will require continued attention on the part of the Organization. Providing guidance in that respect is an additional pressing challenge for the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.</div>

	Mr. lkin (Turkey)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I would like at the outset to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the work of the Organization (<i><a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-60-1.pdf">A/60/1</a></i>) and to commend him for his excellent work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa02">I would also like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session and to express my determination to work closely with him for the realization of the Assembly's goals. He has, indeed, the full confidence and support of my mission.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Since Turkey has aligned itself with the European Union (EU) statement made this morning, I will limit myself to making certain remarks to one particular subject -- terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa04">First of all, we believe that the targeting and deliberate killing not only of civilians and non-combatants but also military and security personnel cannot be justified or legitimized by any cause or grievance. I would like to underline that once again. As we have witnessed time and again, terrorism is a threat to the very existence of individuals, nations and human civilization as a whole. Terrorism is a means of oppression, which humiliates the individual and obstructs the development of humanity. It is a gross violation of human rights, first and foremost the right to life. Thus, all terrorist acts, methods and practices should be condemned as criminal and as unjustifiable under any circumstances, regardless of their motivation. No considerations whatsoever can be invoked to justify terrorist acts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Turkey, as a country which has suffered from terrorism, has long pointed out the critical nature of the problem and alerted the international community to that scourge. Terrorism is the common problem of the whole international community; no nation can consider itself immune.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Turkey fully adheres to the Secretary-General's five-pillar strategy to combat terrorism. We also welcome the clear condemnation of terrorism in the Summit Outcome (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-1.pdf">resolution 60/1</a></i>). We are ready to work with others to conclude, during the sixtieth session, a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.</div>

The report is comprehensive and deals with a wide range of issues, including peace and security, development, the reform of the United Nations and its management, and other international issues that are of great interest to all of us.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa03">Many of those important issues were reflected in the outcome document of the recently concluded High-level Plenary Meeting, although many remain to be negotiated further. The outcome document, although not 100 per cent perfect, correctly reflects the hope and aspirations of humanity for peace, security and development, and reiterates our commitment to achieving those goals in a time-bound manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The international community must provide its continued support to countries with special needs, such as the least developed and landlocked countries, so as to help them to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Such support can start with sincere implementation of agreed commitments and the further extension of development assistance, market access and debt relief to those countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa05">The outcome document categorically states that terrorism is the most serious threat to international peace and security. Nepal joins the international community's condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes, as reflected in the outcome document.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa06">A victim of senseless terror for more than a decade now, Nepal favours combating terrorism resolutely, collectively and comprehensively. We support the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa07">We appreciate the Secretary-General's continued interest and concern at Nepal's current difficult situation. In that context, our attention is drawn to a reference in the report of the Secretary-General about constitutional rule in Nepal. We wish to clarify that the report's specific reference to constitutional rule does not reflect factual reality. His Majesty the King is the custodian of the 1990 Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal. The constitution is alive and active. The steps His Majesty took on 1 February and later were guided by the constitutional obligation of His Majesty the King as head of State to ensure the security and the integrity of the nation and to create an atmosphere conducive to re-energizing multiparty democracy and the rule of law, which had been frustrated by ongoing violence, terrorism and corruption.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa08">Nepal is committed to the protection and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We reaffirm our resolute commitment to the implementation of human rights instruments and international humanitarian law. The establishment of an office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal reflects our desire to protect human rights in accordance with our international legal obligations, although our respect for human rights is rooted in our longstanding moral values and culture.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa09">We welcome the international community's humanitarian assistance for internally displaced persons in Nepal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa10">Nepal welcomes the decision to establish a Peacebuilding Commission to help countries recovering from conflict. We would like the Commission to have equitable representation from troop-contributing countries and its working methods to be specified in clearer terms.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa11">We are proud to recall our continuous participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations since 1958. Our peacekeepers have earned commendation from the international community for their dedication, discipline and professionalism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa12">This year, Nepal is celebrating its fiftieth year of membership in the United Nations. Nepal expresses its sincere appreciation to the United Nations for its invaluable contributions to our socio-economic development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk02-pa13">We believe that the package of reforms that are reflected in the Secretary-General's report and which are to be agreed by the Assembly will help give the United Nations the required strength to meet the challenges of our times.</div>

	Mr. Toro Jiménez (Venezuela)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa01">The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela wishes to take the floor of the General Assembly to thank the Secretary-General for his report on the work of the Organization (<i><a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-60-1.pdf">A/60/1</a></i>).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa02">We also take this opportunity to express our support for the statement made by the delegation of Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa03">We want to affirm our country's support and cooperation in connection with the efforts and the work of the United Nations. Today, the plans to reform the United Nations harbour a grave threat to the future of the Organization because of the proposals of those that view the United Nations as an instrument in the exclusive service of the interests of the United States and its allies. They see the United Nations as a piece of the new neo-colonial order they wish to establish in the world, allowing them to reorganize and divide up markets and areas of influence and thus achieve imperial hegemony, making good use of hollowed out multilateral institutions that turn their back on the people and work against their interests. That scheme would exacerbate the already profound world imbalance as they introduced new mechanisms of interference and repression -- in particular by strengthening the Security Council -- to be used to undermine the sovereign authority of Member States of the United Nations on the pretext of fighting terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Venezuela believes that the United Nations should be the principal democratic organization of a democratic international society that is supported in its socio-economic development. We believe that multilateralism should provide the instrument and the forum for creating a multipolar, independent and peaceful world of solidarity. Our international action should be guided by the overriding imperative of promoting international cooperation aimed at strengthening South-South cooperation, with the fundamental goal of combating poverty and social exclusion, which impede the self-determination of our peoples and pose a grave threat to the democratic stability of States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Venezuela believes that those goals can be achieved only through concrete economic and social policies for the inclusion and empowerment of the people and through wise, democratic government that is closely aligned with the people, who should have a participatory, leading role in all collective political decisions at all levels. Implementing such policies requires the massive mobilization of resources for development, coordination among developing countries and concerted efforts between the developing and the developed countries, because developed countries bear the greater share of responsibility for creating a new world whose highest priority is economic progress and social justice. Taking measures to eradicate poverty -- and thus redress an age-old injustice -- will lay the foundation for a human and just new world order. Nothing could lie further from the sincere call for the Organization to take up the noble, humanitarian task that we have described, and to which we are all committed, than the dark panorama of the present United Nations reform and the final result of the High-level Plenary Meeting.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We are referring to the outcome document that was presented in the Assembly and which is defective owing to its violation of the universal law of respect for due process. For that reason, my delegation reaffirms our President's reservations with respect to a document that our Republic considers null and void in the context of the upcoming negotiations, as he noted in the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa07">The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization poorly reflects the devastating state of the world and the universal Organization, which is called upon to enforce respect for the fundamental values of its Charter in the face of the corrosive action that is destroying, day by day and in an accelerating fashion, human beings, living organisms, the seas, water and productive land -- all of which support the life of humankind on Earth. That corrosive action seems to be sweeping us, with no hope of escape, towards a vortex of destruction.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa08">Regrettably, when we contemplate that situation we are overwhelmed by sadness that an Organization such as the United Nations should be so submissive, so bowed under the weight of its own complacency, that it applauds its own ignominious situation along the path to the scaffold.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Venezuela has made substantial efforts to combat poverty -- as is plain for all to see if they look with unbiased eyes -- despite anti-national, subversive acts that from 2002 onwards have been aimed at undermining the democratic stability of my country and continue to be perpetrated with the financial support of non-governmental organizations assisted by the United States Government.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa10">In that connection, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like to place on record that we do not agree with the way in which the United Nations indicators and methods are crafted to handle and evaluate statistical data that measure implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We do not agree as to the form, the manner or the substance in which the information was presented in the report of the Secretary-General. We do not agree with the monetarist bias of indicators to measure poverty that are linked to the dollar and that do not allow us to quantify the outcome of public policies that address that topic in a comprehensive manner.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa11">In the same vein, there is no way of describing the scope of social policies, specifically missions, nor the role that they play to achieve sustainable, humane and endogenous development that contributes to the attainment of the MDGs. We protest the handling of statistics and the methodological perspective that does not make it possible to consider the specific, concrete socio-political realities of Venezuela, or any other country.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa12">In our case, the events since December 2001 -- from the coup d'état of April 2002 to the defeat of the attempted takeover launched by the oil interests in 2003 -- were a fundamental element that reversed what was until then the positive trends in the country towards achieving the MDGs. We compare our situation to that of Asia since the tsunami and wonder if the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, in its next report, should not refer to that historical reality, which will certainly damage social and economic growth in the affected countries during the period under consideration. For our country, the events of the years 2002 and 2003 were equivalent to a tsunami.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa13">Finally, we would like to say that the proposal to set up a new Human Rights Council with the idea of a simplistic transition from the current Human Rights Commission is not going to solve existing problems. What we have before us is not a problem of semantics -- of terms, structures or procedures. Any reforms proposed for the current Human Rights Commission should essentially be designed to bring about profound political changes and, of course, should expand its membership.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Belinga Eboutou" nation="Cameroon" language="French">
	Mr. Belinga Eboutou (Cameroon)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his excellent analytical report on the work of the Organization. That report gives us a very in-depth overview and a great deal of information on all facets of United Nations activity. Of course, my delegation joins in the statement made by Jamaica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The report, along with the outcome document adopted at the end of the recent High-level Plenary Meeting, will be of the greatest usefulness in our deliberations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa02">In the area of the maintenance of international peace and security, the Secretary-General points out that during the past year most situations in that domain have improved. However, he also points out that others have unfortunately deteriorated. United Nations action, along with the political determination of the parties to a conflict to fulfil their commitments, and that of interested actors who have used all of their influence to resolve the situation, has been decisive in improving the climate of peace. My delegation agrees with that analysis. I would like to commend all United Nations activities undertaken throughout the world to prevent conflicts and to restore, maintain and consolidate peace. In that connection, we encourage parties to ongoing conflicts to demonstrate the political will to settle their differences peacefully and to make use of the good offices of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa03">Cameroon welcomes the electoral assistance given by the United Nations to Africa. As the Secretary-General noted, the holding of credible elections has today become an essential element in the restoration and consolidation of peace, as well as in the prevention of conflicts. Cameroon encourages the Organization to continue working along those lines and for its part will continue to support the inclusion of electoral support in the mandates of peacekeeping operations and in political agreements concluded in countries in conflict or those emerging from conflict that are in political transition.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa04">More specifically with regard to peacekeeping operations, my delegation is in favour of strengthening African capacity in that sphere, including through cooperation with regional organizations. Such capacity-building should necessarily include provision for the establishment of African contingents and the improvement of their ability to respond rapidly on the ground. Indeed, Africa's autonomy in the area of peacekeeping is a necessity. It is part of the list of special needs of Africa in the areas of peace and security.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa05">In the area of cooperation for development, the Secretary-General advocates, with regard to Africa's special needs, international support for the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). The Secretary-General's report, which makes recommendations on the way to mobilize such support, will be considered during the current session and my delegation will make substantive comments on the item at that time.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa06">NEPAD will be a powerful engine for development in Africa if African debt on the condition that debt is alleviated or even cancelled, that assistance increases considerably, and that growth and the combat against poverty are stimulated through equitable participation in world trade.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa07">Cameroon welcomed with satisfaction the confirmation of the cancellation of 100 per cent of the debt owed to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the African Development Bank by a number of heavily indebted poor countries. We believe that this measure is a promising one that should be extended speedily to additional countries. In that connection, we have high hopes for the meeting to be held this weekend in London.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa08">My delegation has taken due note of the contents of paragraph 25 of the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization. In that paragraph, the Secretary-General deals with the implementation of the 10 October 2002 ruling by the International Court of Justice regarding the territorial dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria. I should like to express my country's appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General for his good offices and for the ongoing interest he has shown in the implementation of that decision. I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm Cameroon's resolute determination -- which, in fact, is noted in the report, to "moving the process forward in accordance with the ruling of the International Court of Justice".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa09">We welcome the Secretary-General's decision to report on his work with regard to this dispute in the part of his report devoted to conflict prevention and to the restoration of peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa10">Cameroon wishes to reiterate the proposal it made in this very Hall on 23 September 2005, during the general debate. My country, as members will recall, emphasized the need fully to inform Member States, the Security Council and the General Assembly of the status of the implementation of the rulings handed down by the International Court of Justice, just as those organs are informed of the Court's annual activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa11">Implementation of the rulings of the International Court of Justice -- for which it is not responsible -- remains of pivotal importance to international peace and security, because a dispute does not end, and is not considered to have ended, until the Court's ruling has been fully implemented.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa12">The situation resulting from the non-implementation, for an extended period, of a ruling can jeopardize international peace and security. That is why my country believes that the Secretary-General must regularly inform, in detail, the Security Council of the status of decisions handed down by the Court and inform Member States in his report to the General Assembly on the work of the Organization, whether or not the Organization is directly involved in the implementation process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa13">We believe that all States should be informed of what is being done to achieve peace so that they can assist the protagonists involved by lending support and advice.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa14">Mr. President, we hope that our request will be included among the conclusions that you will be drawing from this debate. If, indeed, responsibility for international peace and security falls on each and every Member State, the implementation of the Court's rulings -- rulings which contribute to it -- are just as important.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa15">In conclusion, Cameroon supports the Secretary-General's appeal to reflect, at this sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations, on ways in which we could better discharge our duties and responsibilities. We remain convinced that, without the support and cooperation of Member States, the United Nations will not be in a position to face the challenges of this new century or to meet the expectations of peoples in the United Nations.</div>
