<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Holliday</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">We would like to thank Ambassador Akram for all his work on this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">We are sponsoring this resolution as a statement of our strong support of the ongoing efforts of the United Nations to ensure peace and stability in Liberia and the region, and its recognition that premature lifting of sanctions at this time would threaten the re-emergence of armed conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">We share the desire of other Council member States to see Liberia's timber sector restored quickly as a source of legitimate revenue for the National Transitional Government. However, to accomplish that objective, we believe there must be security, transparency and accountability in the timber sector. At present, Liberia lacks the necessary institutional and financial mechanisms to ensure that forest resources are used for legitimate development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">Consistent with its desire to help Liberia quickly re-establish the conditions under which forest resources can be used for the benefit of the Liberian people, the United States Government has allocated $4 million and is working closely with the Government and other donors to implement reforms in the timber sector through the Liberia Forest Initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">It is critical that Liberia make a strong effort to implement those needed reforms, and I am pleased that, in the resolution adopted today, the Council has underlined the need for the Government to act boldly and quickly in instituting those reforms. Unfortunately, Liberia's Forestry Development Authority has not yet implemented the reforms that have been called for.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">With the full cooperation from Liberian authorities, we believe that substantial progress can be achieved over the next six to eight months in many of the most important aspects of the reform effort.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">In coordination with other donors, we have outlined a critical path timeline of necessary actions and donor resources intended to fulfil these aims and address the principal concerns of the Council. We urge the National Transitional Government of Liberia to do its utmost to cooperate in this endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">In closing, the United States Government is actively engaged in assisting the Liberian authorities to restructure both Liberia's timber and diamond sectors as a means to expedite, and not retard, the eventual lifting of sanctions, once necessary and appropriate control mechanisms have been established. It is essential that these key resources and the revenue derived from their export be used responsibly in the future to improve the lives of the Liberian people and not to perpetuate conflict, as in the past.</p>
