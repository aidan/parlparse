	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1063.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1063</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 15 September 1994 from the Permanent Representatives of Argentina and New Zealand to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council has given further consideration to the question of communication between members and non-members of the Council, in particular troop contributing countries, which was addressed in the statement of the President of the Council of 3 May 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-22.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/22</a>). The Council remains conscious of the implications which its decisions on peace-keeping operations have for troop contributing countries. Having regard to the increase in the number and complexity of such operations, it believes that there is a need for further enhancement, in a pragmatic and flexible manner, of the arrangements for consultation and exchange of information with troop contributing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"To this end, the Security Council has decided in future to follow the procedures set out in this statement:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa08">-- meetings should be held as a matter of course between members of the Council, troop contributing countries and the Secretariat to facilitate the exchange of information and views in good time before the Council takes decisions on extension or termination of, or significant changes in, the mandate of a particular peace-keeping operation;</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa09">-- such meetings would be chaired jointly by the Presidency of the Council and a representative of the Secretariat nominated by the Secretary-General;</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa10">-- the monthly tentative forecast of work of the Council made available to Member States will in future include an indication of the expected schedule of such meetings for the month;</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa11">-- in the context of their review of the tentative forecast, the members of the Council will examine this schedule and communicate any suggested changes or proposals as to the timing of meetings to the Secretariat;</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa12">-- ad hoc meetings chaired jointly by the Presidency of the Security Council and a representative of the Secretariat nominated by the Secretary-General may be convened in the event of unforeseen developments in a particular peace-keeping operation which could require action by the Council;</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa13">-- such meetings will be in addition to those convened and chaired solely by the Secretariat for troop contributors to meet with Special Representatives of the Secretary-General or Force Commanders or to discuss operational matters concerning particular peace-keeping operations, to which members of the Security Council will also be invited;</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa14">-- an informal paper, including topics to be covered and drawing attention to relevant background documentation, will be circulated by the Secretariat to the participants well in advance of each of the various meetings referred to above;</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa15">-- the time and venue of each meeting with members of the Council and troop contributors to a peace-keeping operation should where possible appear in advance in the <i>Journal </i>of the United Nations;</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa16">-- the President of the Council will, in the course of informal consultations of members of the Council, summarize the views expressed by participants at each meeting with troop contributors.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa17">"The Security Council recalls that the arrangements described herein are not exhaustive. Consultations may take a variety of forms, including informal communication between the Council President or its members and troop contributing countries and, as appropriate, with other countries especially affected, for example from the region concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa18">"The Security Council will keep arrangements for the exchange of information and views with troop contributors under review and stands ready to consider further measures to enhance arrangements in the light of experience.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa19">"The Security Council will also keep under review arrangements to improve the quality and speed of the flow of information available to support Council decision-making bearing in mind the conclusions contained in its statement of 3 May 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-22.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/22</a>)."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa20">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-62.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/62</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa21">We have thus concluded our business for this meeting. The next meeting of the Security Council to continue consideration of the item on the agenda will take place immediately following this meeting.</p>
