	 Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">We are witnessing the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East with the most serious crisis experienced in the area in recent years. The spiral of violence and State terrorism, with the death of innocent civilians and the desperation of millions of Palestinians and Arabs, systematically destroy the hope that serious and constructive dialogue can open the long path to peace.</div>
	<div class="p">Occupied Arab Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese territories continue to be occupied in flagrant violation of a broad range of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. The inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the creation of its own independent and sovereign State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, continues to be denied. Illegal Israeli colonialist settlement continues in occupied Arab territories, whose legitimate inhabitants are expelled from their lands. Grave violations of international humanitarian law and human rights of the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples under Israeli occupation are committed daily. Thousands of dead and tens of thousands wounded by the use of heavy and high-technology weapons testify to the fact that not even the right to life is respected.</div>
	<div class="p">We awakened this morning to terrible images of missile attacks by the Israeli army. Extrajudicial killings, selective assassinations, torture and brutal repression, including the destruction of homes, are carried out before our very eyes.</div>
	<div class="p">Economic pressure against the most vulnerable population is strengthened through embargoes, closures, taxes, the withholding of financial transfers and the flagrant daily violation of the agreements between the parties. To the physical and psychological blows one must add the flagrant violations of the right to food, education, health and development of millions of people in this part of the world. The coarse manipulation by the media that control information globally habitually conceals and distorts the facts and deceives public opinion, serving in a disciplined way the political interests of their Governments.</div>
	<div class="p">Innocent Israeli civilians, unfortunately, are also victims of the spiral of violence and terror caused by the policy of their Government. Cuba emphatically condemns the terrorist suicide bombings that took place over the weekend in Jerusalem and Haifa. There are many forces within Israel that are opposed to the continuation of the war and that share with neighbouring peoples the desire for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect.</div>
	<div class="p">There will not be a just and lasting peace if Israel does not denounce its occupation policy. There will be no peace if the legitimate interests of all the peoples of the region are not taken into consideration. There will be no peace if the Security Council does not implement its many resolutions or if it does not use its broad powers. There will be no peace if one of the permanent members of the Council continues to use the veto to impede the implementation of those resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p">There also will be no real progress in the global campaign against terrorism if those who claim to be the leaders of this campaign protect in the Security Council the exercise of State terrorism against the Palestinian and Arab peoples under occupation. Security Council reform that will eliminate, or at least temporarily curb, use of the veto and put an end to the double standard typical of that organ is urgent.</div>
	<div class="p">The recent history of the Middle East and of Palestine might have been different had the United States not vetoed 36 draft Security Council resolutions since 1972. It is a tragic paradox that a permanent member of the Security Council and the world super-Power should also be the Power that pays for and supplies the aeroplanes, helicopters and state-of-the-art missiles that are used to murder innocent civilians with impunity in that tumultuous region.</div>
	<div class="p">It is necessary to put an end to Israel's usurpation and occupation of the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza, of the Syrian Golan and of areas in southern Lebanon that are under Israeli army control. It is necessary to find a lasting and satisfactory solution for the millions of refugees and displaced persons. All the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly should be fully implemented, particularly Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978). It is urgent to deploy an international force to protect Palestinian civilians. It is essential that the United Nations play a genuine, effective role that would guarantee impartiality in the negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p">A solution to the Palestinian problem remains the core of a settlement of the Middle East conflict. There can be no peace or security unless the just demands of the Palestinian are met and unless the usurped Syrian and Lebanese territories are returned.</div>
	<div class="p">Nobody denies Israel's right to exist, and the occupying Power must not deny the right of its neighbours to live on their own lands and to engage in peaceful development in independent, sovereign, prosperous nations and States. The Cuban delegation supports the urgent convening of the Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.</div>
	<div class="p">The community of nations bears a major responsibility and must face it decisively and courageously no matter how difficult it may be. In that effort, the international community can always count on the constructive contribution and the traditional firm support and solidarity of Cuba.</div>

<span class="speaker" name=" Mr. Pamir" nation="Turkey" language="">
	 Mr. Pamir (Turkey)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I would like at the outset to express, on behalf of my Government and of the Turkish nation, our profound sympathy and deepest condolences to the bereaved families of the victims of the outrageous terrorist attacks which took place last weekend at Jerusalem and Haifa. This morning's news from the region clearly confirms once again the risks involved in a vicious circle of violence.</div>
	<div class="p">Turkey has already aligned itself with the statements made on 29 and 30 November on behalf of the European Union on the agenda items entitled "The question of Palestine" and "The situation in the Middle East". That being said, I would like to further address those agenda items and to expound our views on both.</div>
	<div class="p">Only four days ago, we commemorated the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, when the Secretary-General reminded us of the growing mistrust and animosity between the Israelis and the Palestinians, which has sadly come to the fore as a result of recurrent violence. The fact is that the escalation of violence has greatly undermined all the noble efforts directed at building bridges of reconciliation and feelings of partnership between those two ancient peoples. Nobody can be proud of the current standstill, which has been inflicted by violence, robbing the region and its peoples of the assurance of healthy prospects for a secure and enlightened future.</div>
	<div class="p">More than six months has passed since the Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee -- in whose work the former President of my country, His Excellency Mr. Süleyman Demirel, participated actively -- issued its ground-breaking report. And each precious day that has elapsed and every ominous development that has taken place since then has vindicated the basic wisdom and understanding that shaped the Mitchell report. Today, the implementation of the recommendations contained in that report remains the only viable path towards breaking the circle of violence at long last and reviving the Middle East peace process.</div>
	<div class="p">Therefore, and as a corollary, without waiting for any specified period and irrespective of the reason for it, the fighting should stop. Each side should do its utmost to prevent any such occurrence, show restraint and limit its reactions so that the process we all long for -- founded on the art of rebuilding confidence and trust instead of cowardice and mistrust -- between Israel and the Palestinian Authority can start in earnest. In the same vein, and at the same time, terrorism in all its forms should be renounced unequivocally.</div>
	<div class="p">It is high time indeed that all of us fully understood that searching for degrees of sense and reason in acts of terrorism is futile, not to mention self-defeating, anti-humanitarian and downright dangerous. We would like to hope that the international coalition against terrorism forged in the aftermath of the horrendous attacks of 11 September will encourage both parties to seek lasting peace. It was in that spirit that we welcomed the agreement between President Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres in late September, which was unfortunately marred once again by the continuation of wanton violence.</div>
	<div class="p">We really cannot lose our hope for peace. None who have the prosperity and well-being of future generations in mind and in sight can allow themselves to lose their hope for peace. That is why we have been reminding the parties of their responsibility before the flow of history to curb and then eradicate violence and to de-escalate tension on the ground, so that they can meet each other's fundamental needs: security in word and reality for Israel, and viable political prospects for the Palestinians. Their request to gain their inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination and to a State of their own, is a just cause.</div>
	<div class="p">It is only through the resumption of peace talks that the international community can expect to see a lasting and comprehensive agreement that will enable Israel and Palestine to live side by side within mutually recognized borders. The realistic and well-balanced Mitchell report and the Tenet plan, with its clearly defined parameters, constitute the pillars of a genuine road map that will lead the region to peace to be achieved on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land for peace.</div>
	<div class="p">While Turkey supports all international efforts directed at finding a solution to this problem, we deem the active involvement of the United States to be necessary in this sphere as well. We welcome heartily the commitment of the United States to a just peace in the Middle East, as expressed by President Bush and Secretary of State Powell on 10 and 19 November respectively. It is worthwhile to repeat the prospect put forward by the Secretary of State, as it describes a positive vision. He foresees the establishment of a State of Palestine which will live side by side with its neighbour Israel in peace, security and dignity. That State should assure the security of Israel and recognize its legitimacy.</div>
	<div class="p">We very much hope that this will be the point of departure for enduring peace, and a station at which to leave behind once and for all the tragedy of the past, and from which to depart towards a secure and enlightened future for the Middle East. It is in that spirit that we call upon the parties to show leadership of historic proportions and to exercise maximum restraint in order not to let themselves be derailed from the track towards this noble vision. Turkey, for its part, stands ready to contribute to these efforts and to continue to act as a facilitator.</div>
	<div class="p">While the Palestinian-Israeli conflict lies at the core of the Middle East problem, we must not lose sight of the other tracks. We are concerned that the process on the Syrian track has come to a standstill. We hope that peace talks on this track will soon resume. In this context, we welcomed the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in accordance with Security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978)">resolution 425 (1978)</a> and consider it to be a crucial step in the right direction.</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="3-8">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Al-Hussein" nation="Jordan" language="Arabic">
	Mr. Al-Hussein (Jordan)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The question of the Middle East, the core of which is the question of Palestine, remains an important item on this Assembly's agenda, especially as the discussion of this item is taking place at a time when the Palestinian people is a target of acts of military aggression by the Israeli occupation authorities and of their use of unjustified force. This will only result in more bloodshed, throw the Middle East peace process into an even deeper crisis and cause further deterioration in the situation between the two parties, as well as in the entire region.</div>
	<div class="p">How can we be convinced that peace is the ultimate goal when Israel continues to impose blockades against the Palestinian people, to implement assassination schemes, to make incursions into the territories under the control of the Palestinian National Authority and to build settlements, all of which are contrary to the principle of land for peace. Israel denies the rights of the Palestinians; yet, justice is the basis for peace, and peace is the framework for security.</div>
	<div class="p">Jordan firmly believes that the resolution of this conflict will not be possible through the use of force or by coercive or security measures. In this regard, we strongly condemn the targeting and killing of civilian populations on both sides. Indeed, there is no alternative but the return of the two parties to the negotiating table as equal partners seeking a settlement that would ensure their legitimate rights and their future. This will not be achieved unless reciprocal, parallel steps are taken on the basis of the accords and obligations concluded between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. First and foremost, the use of the Israeli military machine against the Palestinian people must end.</div>
	<div class="p">Taking these steps would constitute the right approach towards implementing the Mitchell commission's recommendations, which aim primarily at creating conditions conducive to a return to the negotiating table. Starting the final status negotiations would symbolize the urgent priority to achieve the primary objective of the peace process -- namely, the fulfilment of national Palestinian rights, the establishment of a viable Palestinian State on Palestinian territory and the provision of security for Israel.</div>
	<div class="p">Jordan's concept of peace, as we have repeatedly stated in this Assembly, is that it must be just, lasting and comprehensive. This concept has been underlined by the international parties directly involved in the Middle East question. Our firm commitment to peace within this concept is based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). These two resolutions, as well as other relevant General Assembly resolutions, have not yet been implemented, despite the passage of several decades since their adoption.</div>
	<div class="p">At this point, we must once again emphasize the United Nations role and responsibility towards the question of the Middle East, the peace process and the need for the revival of this role. We further underscore the responsibility to support the efforts and endeavours to push the peace process forward towards its desired objectives. The United Nations, its Charter, resolutions and provisions are the basic norms for the resolution of disputes, and they govern the basic rule of international law.</div>
	<div class="p">The peace process has been based on recognized and firm principles, primarily the principle of land for peace. We cannot understand how justice can be fulfilled without full Israeli withdrawal from all Palestinian and other Arab occupied territories.</div>
	<div class="p">Jordan welcomes the announcement by President George W. Bush regarding sponsoring a United States solution that would ensure the existence of two States, including a Palestinian State on occupied Palestinian territory on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions. This would complete the international consensus on the basic requirement for achieving peace in the region.</div>
	<div class="p">It is our hope that the United States efforts will continue, with the support of the European Union countries, Russia and the international community as a whole. We also welcome the thrust of United States Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement on the need to end Israeli occupation, in line with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).</div>
	<div class="p">Comprehensive peace must include Israel's withdrawal from occupied Syrian territory back to the 4 June 1967 lines and a complete withdrawal from the remaining occupied Lebanese territory on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p">There is an international juridical consensus that East Jerusalem is part of the West Bank territory that was occupied in 1967. As such, it is subject to Security Council resolutions. Indeed, the Council has treated the City of Jerusalem as a special case since the beginning of the Israeli occupation, and all along it has adopted a series of resolutions that reject annexation by Israel of East Jerusalem. Those resolutions also reject all Israeli measures and legislation aimed at changing the character of the Holy City and the works undertaken in order to transform its demographic and topographic character.</div>
	<div class="p">Therefore, all the announcements made repeatedly by Israeli officials regarding Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel are contrary to all foundations of the peace process. East Jerusalem is an occupied territory under international resolutions, and it is the spiritual centre of the three divine religions. Also, we would like to see Jerusalem as an ideal, noble symbol of peace and cooperation. This will not be achieved unless and until Israel withdraws from the territories occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, and a return of those territories to their legitimate owners, with Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State.</div>
	<div class="p">The question of the Palestinian refugees who were forced out of their homeland in 1947, 1948 and 1967, and those who were deported over the many and long years of occupation is still waiting for a just solution under international law and United Nations resolutions, especially General Assembly resolution 194 (III), which called for the rights of the Palestinian people to return or to receive compensation for their suffering during years of deportation, exile and occupation. The solution of the question of refugees remains one of the most important cornerstones of peace and security in the region.</div>
	<div class="p">In closing, my delegation would like to affirm categorically our full support for a comprehensive peace and the need to focus our efforts on stopping the deterioration of conditions in the occupied Arab territories.</div>
</div>

	Mr. Chaudhary (Nepal)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The situation in the Middle East is still volatile. Numerous lives have been lost since September 2000. Both sides -- the Palestinians and the Israelis -- have suffered a great deal due to the continuing violence in the region, which, unfortunately, has not seen peace for the last five decades, from the time of the United Nations partition plan in 1947.</div>
	<div class="p">The establishment of a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle East will be possible only with the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Nepal has always placed emphasis on the full implementation of those resolutions. We believe that both sides need to exercise the utmost restraint in order to create an environment conducive to giving peace a chance.</div>
	<div class="p">Nepal is deeply concerned at the outbreak of violence in the Middle East, which has resulted in the loss of precious human lives and in the destruction of property. We very much look forward to seeing the adoption of some practical measures before serious negotiations are brought back on track with a view to restoring lasting peace.</div>
	<div class="p">In this regard, we believe that implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Mitchell committee, released last April, and the Tenet ceasefire plan can, even under the present circumstances, play a very positive role in reducing tensions, which are running so high.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe that the international community's attention should be drawn to the need to ensure the exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination, with the creation of an independent state. The recent announcement by the United States Government of its intention to become more closely involved in efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East has also encouraged many of us who would like to see a lasting peace established in the region sooner rather than later.</div>
	<div class="p">The violent acts in the region of the Middle East must cease. Only a return to negotiations involving all of the parties concerned can lead to the promotion of peace and prosperity in the Middle East. The need of the hour is urgently to reverse the situation and to try to build on the achievements recorded so far with a view to establishing stability in the region.</div>

	<div class="p">It is with great concern that we view the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East and the escalation of violence to a level unknown for years. We call upon the Israeli and Palestinian sides immediately to return, without preconditions, to the negotiating table on the basis of the recommendations of the Mitchell report and the Tenet plan, which must be implemented fully and without delay.</div>
	<div class="p">The European Union believes that a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace in the region will not be complete without the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese tracks. These negotiations must be undertaken as soon as possible in order to reach an agreement in conformity with the same principles.</div>

	Mr. Lancry (Israel)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I am grateful for the opportunity to express my views on the voting on the draft resolutions on the question of Palestine.</div>
	<div class="p">Normally, this kind of voting hardly inspires us to offer an explanation, given how accustomed Israel has become to the unfailing ritual whereby it invariably finds itself, year after year, in splendid yet scarcely enviable isolation. Today, however, following the surge of Palestinian terrorism and the carnage of the last 48 hours in Jerusalem and Haifa, we are compelled to break with the traditional silent objection adopted by my delegation in previous years.</div>
	<div class="p">Indeed, we must tell the General Assembly today that, in the face of the Palestinian terrorist furor, we cannot remain indifferent. We cannot accept an endorsement -- based on a reflex conditioned by the shackles of automatic majorities and the burden of prejudice forged in the arbitrary nature of alliances and inalienable alignments -- of Palestinian terrorist attacks that corrupt any possibility of resuming negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p">Peace, according to the Palestinians, is a matter of strategic choice. And yet, their strategy for peace is heavily dependent on terrorist tactics, the devastating effects of which obscure the visibility and credibility of the peace process. Unless it considers Palestinian terrorism in its most abject and perverse form to be a kind of national resistance -- and thus ultimately acceptable -- the General Assembly must make a moral choice today and distance itself from certain Palestinian terrorist practices, the barbarism of which has no equal but in the suicidal and fanatical impulse that underlies it.</div>
	<div class="p">I urgently appeal here and now to my colleagues in many delegations to disengage themselves from draft resolutions that would endow Palestinian terrorism with international legitimacy, in flagrant contradiction to acts that no national aspiration, no matter how noble, can justify. I appeal here to those of my colleagues who are people of conscience. I appeal to colleagues whose alignment is not inevitably equivalent to blind partisanship. I appeal to colleagues who, in recent weeks and months, have courageously asserted their rejection of terrorism in all its forms and who should be able to demonstrate their independence, here and now, as they face a decisive and crucial choice.</div>
	<div class="p">In the voting on issues connected to the question of Palestine, Israel usually entertains hopes of rather modest support. The importance of the voting today lies in the quality of the message to be sent by the General Assembly to the Palestinians. That is up to the General Assembly to determine in its soul and conscience.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">As in previous years, the Russian Federation</div>
	<div class="p">will vote in favour of the draft resolution on the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine, contained in draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.22">A/56/L.22</a>.</div>
	<div class="p">At the same time, I wish to report that, yesterday, the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation issued a statement in which it strongly condemned the bloody terrorist act carried out in Jerusalem on 1 December and described that act as cruel provocation aimed at undermining attempts to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. We express our condolences to the families of the victims of that monstrous crime and once again call most categorically on the leadership of the Palestinian Authority to take effective measures to curb the extremists.</div>
	<div class="p">We are convinced that it is now more necessary than ever to intensify efforts to implement the Mitchell and Tenet plans for the normalization of the situation and a resumption of the negotiating process. Accommodating steps must be taken by the Palestinians and Israelis to break the senseless cycle of violence, in which every act of bloodshed, regardless of who may perpetrate it, only leads to an escalation of the crisis and claims more victims.</div>
	<div class="p">The Russian Federation, along with its American co-sponsors, the European Union, the United Nations and other parties, will continue to work for the easing of tensions and for returning the situation to the political track.</div>

</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea's position on the question of the right to self-determination is well known in the Assembly, and I do not need to repeat it. It has been reflected in Papua New Guinea's affirmative vote on draft resolutions on this subject in the past. However, Papua New Guinea has abstained in the voting this time.</div>
	<div class="p">We believe that peace cannot be achieved through continued violence, such as that occurring in the last several months in the Middle East region. As a Melanesian country and, for that matter, a Pacific island country, we believe that peace can be achieved only through negotiations and discussions with our adversaries to resolve differences and bring about the common peace we all desire.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea continues to believe that Israel must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and, as a result, to have a State. We also believe that Israel has a right to coexist in a safe and secure environment with its neighbours, and the State of Israel must therefore be assured of its right to coexist within safe and secure boundaries.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea also believes in the purposes of the United Nations as outlined in its Charter. Unless the United Nations is taking action under Chapter VII of the Charter, it must be seen as impartial at all times when dealing with parties to a conflict. It must not be seen as taking a position that could be interpreted to be pre-empting the outcome of any negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p">Papua New Guinea believes in the sanctity of life, whether Israeli or Palestinian. It is wrong to commit suicide or to use one's own body as a weapon of destruction. Extrajudicial killings also have no place in a civil society that is founded on the rule of law. By the same token, we are concerned about the implementation of the rule of law, and about governance generally, inside Palestinian-controlled areas. Peaceful coexistence is an uncertain outcome when there are elements in conflict that do not recognize the right of Israel to exist within secure borders.</div>
	<div class="p">In our view, these matters are not properly reflected in the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.22">A/55/L.22</a>. We have therefore abstained in the voting on the draft resolution.</div>

	<div class="p">My delegation voted in favour of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.22">A/56/L.22</a> because we feel that the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine is one of the indispensable elements in the settlement of the conflict in the Middle East.</div>
	<div class="p">Nonetheless, we would like to repeat the following observations in relation to the content of the draft resolution's operative paragraph 3.</div>
	<div class="p">Mexico observes that one of the postulates of the peace process in the Middle East is the return of land in exchange for peace. The formula of land for peace has demonstrated its usefulness on the path towards the resolution of this specific conflict. However, it would be hazardous to convert it into a universal legal principle and a norm applicable to all conflicts.</div>
	<div class="p">Behind that formula is the general principle of international law that military conquest does not confer territorial rights. We all recognize the fundamental norm that the acquisition of territories by means of force is inadmissible. As a corollary to this universal principle, it should be concluded that the totality of any territory occupied in an armed conflict should be returned unconditionally to its legitimate owners. That is why the delegation of Mexico repeats that even though we recognize the political value of that formula, we consider that it is not a very rigorous step to elevate it to the status of a general principle of international law.</div>
	<div class="p">Mexico would like once again to appeal for greater precision in the language used to describe a political understanding that is not, nor can be, a universal legal principle. In fact, in the eighth preambular paragraph of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.24">A/56/L.24</a>, on the Syrian Golan, which the Assembly also adopted at this meeting, reference is made to "the formula of land for peace". That is an expression that we feel much more correctly describes that understanding. The word "formula" is what we would prefer to see in all draft resolutions related to this issue. For Mexico, this is a matter of legal purity of terminology and does not have to do with the substance of the political understanding.</div>

	 Mr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">The observer delegation of Palestine is pleased with the outcome of voting on the draft resolution discussed today. We are deeply grateful to the General Assembly for this clear stance towards the Holy City of Jerusalem and rejection of the actions taken by Israel. No delegation voted against that resolution, except for Israel and, unfortunately, Nauru, for reasons that we cannot understand or know.</div>
	<div class="p">The results of the voting show the refusal of the international community to accept Israel's position on Jerusalem; a clear position regarding the State of Palestine, whose establishment is a sine qua non for achieving overall peace in the region; and a clear position of appreciation for the role of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, the Division for Palestinian Rights and the United Nations special information programme.</div>
	<div class="p">Our deep thanks go to the Chairman of the aforementioned Committee, Ambassador Papa Louis Fall, the members of the Bureau and the other members of the Committee, as well as all those who supported and voted in favour of these important resolutions today, especially the sponsors.</div>
	<div class="p">The Palestinian leadership has condemned the attacks that took place in Israel over the past few days. The Palestinian leadership expressed its outrage over these terrorist attacks not only because of the human losses they caused on the Israeli side but also because of the damage they inflict on our national cause, on the efforts to resume the peace talks and, last but not least, on the very unity of the Palestinian people.</div>
	<div class="p">Yesterday, the Palestinian leadership adopted a series of extraordinary decisions in this regard, including declaring a temporary state of emergency and making it illegal for any Palestinian faction not to comply with a ceasefire.</div>
	<div class="p">Today, Israeli helicopter gunships fired many missiles in the area of the offices of Chairman Yasser Arafat and attacked and destroyed two non-military helicopters belonging to the Palestinian Authority. Yesterday, the Israeli occupation forces shot to death five Palestinian martyrs. The day before, they killed two children after sweeping into the outskirts of the city of Jenin. Before that, the occupation forces were continually killing Palestinians, including by extrajudicial executions and planting a time bomb in a civilian neighbourhood, resulting in the deaths of five Palestinian schoolchildren. I wish to note that it was an army that undertook these attacks, and not an unofficial group or even Israeli settlers. Israel, the occupying Power, continues to violate the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 with deliberate killings, war crimes and State-sponsored terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly has discussed in depth the question of international terrorism, which dominated the Assembly's agenda this year. During that debate, we expressed our position clearly as part of the international consensus. At the same time, we warned against imposing an illegitimate agenda on the international agenda, and most specifically the Israeli agenda.</div>
	<div class="p">Israel continues its attempts to impose its own particular agenda. This time it is waging a fight, through its friends in the United States of America, to take control of the battle against terrorism, to have it work in its favour by linking the campaign of the United States and the international community in Afghanistan to what Israel is doing, trying to project itself as if it were in the same fight. As far as we know, the United States is not an occupying Power in Afghanistan. It has never been that. It has not denied any people its right to self-determination for over 35 years. It did not wage a protracted, oppressive, bloody war against that people. What Israel is doing is lowly; it will not improve its status as an occupying Power, but it will do great damage to the international campaign against terrorism and to the international coalition against terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Yes, there have been terrorist attacks carried out inside Israel, but this phenomenon started recently, only a few years ago. This is an outcome, and not the reason for the current situation. The reason is the uprooting of the Palestinian people from their homeland and their denial of their own State for more than 50 years. The reason is the Israeli occupation of those Palestinians who remained in Palestine after more than 35 years. The reason is colonialist settlement, taking control of land and water resources, bringing Israeli settlers to the occupied territories and isolating our people in their towns and villages. The reason is suppression, deportation, detentions and assassinations throughout so many years. The reason is war crimes and State-sponsored terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p">Despite all that, there is no justification for directing terror against civilians. It does not justify terrorism despite all the pain and suffering. But this explains it and places it in a clear context. More importantly, it prevents Israel from using that as a pretext for completing its efforts to destroy peace in the region and perhaps to demolish the Palestinian Authority and restore the occupation of all Palestinian territory.</div>
	<div class="p">The retreat by a limited number of friendly States from voting in favour of the resolution on the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine was a step in the wrong direction. It is not a position against terrorism, because we all stand united against terrorism. It is a position, deliberate or not, of making the fight against terrorism the single most important task in the region. We cannot accept this line of argument. The main task is to put an end to the occupation and to build peace, and in the course of doing that, to resist oppression, violence and terrorism. That position provides a convenient pretext for the Government of Israel to maintain its brutal, bloody campaign against our people, to continue circumventing the implementation of the Mitchell recommendations and, more importantly, to avoid ending its occupation of the Palestinian territory, which is the core issue. We regret that this position is not in line with the statements made by some of those countries and their lip service to establishing a Palestinian State.</div>
	<div class="p">However, more important than all that is what I said at the beginning. The strong and clear international position once again sends the message -- primarily to Israel, the occupying Power, and to all peoples of the region, including the Palestinian people -- that the international community continues to favour the observance of international law, on the side of right and justice, and to favour peace-building efforts in the Middle East region, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.</div>
	<div class="p">I wish to thank all Members. We hope that we will meet again next year under better conditions than those prevailing today.</div>

<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I wish to thank the representatives of many delegations for their expressions of condolence and their condemnation and denunciation of Palestinian terrorism and for their appeals for the resumption of negotiations. We have noted with satisfaction that our appeal in the course of our explanation of vote before the vote seems to have been heeded by a number of delegations and that a certain message, be it muffled, appears to have been transmitted today to the Palestinian side. Fourteen months of violence and Palestinian terrorism have done nothing to advance their cause. The results of the vote today testify to that.</div>
	<div class="p">Even within an organization in which, at times, a certain majority forms a kind of wall, we saw today some cracks in that wall: openings towards a fairer, more independent vote. Some other delegations too have noted the glaring inadequacies of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.22">A/56/L.22</a>, entitled "Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine". In their statements in explanation of vote, the Permanent Representatives of those delegations worked to bridge the deepening gulf the Palestinian delegation is digging with that draft resolution.</div>
	<div class="p">In our view, this terrorism should be understood in its terrorist dimension: to describe it in terms of a cycle of violence is incomplete. We are convinced that the international community is duty-bound to denounce Palestinian terrorist practices without ambiguity, without understatement, without lexical subtleties. It is by recalling the true nature of Palestinian terrorism, unmasking it and denouncing it for what it is that we can truly help the Palestinians become committed to dialogue, coexistence and peace.</div>
	<div class="p">The Palestinians mention Israel's "excessive use of force" and "extrajudicial killings". Perhaps one day the Palestinians can explain to us how the Palestinians, in their commitment to suicide terrorism and to mowing down Israelis by the dozen, are not engaging in the excessive use of force. Can our Palestinian partners tell us whether, with their implacable suicide attacks, they are departing from certain legal norms? In the Jerusalem and Haifa attacks there was no moderate use of force or, unfortunately, any act of justice. Justice will be restored to the Palestinian and Israeli peoples when peace is established through dialogue, through education for peace, through an end to hatred and incitement, and through absolute and total renunciation of the weapon of terrorism. Here I recall the 9 September 1993 letter from Yasser Arafat, dated four days before the signing of the Oslo accord, in which Chairman Arafat, in order to attain his strategic political ends, undertook to renounce all forms of terrorism. It is to those words of that letter that we should return.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I associate myself with the hope expressed by the Permanent Observer of Palestine, His Excellency Mr. Nasser Al-Kidwa, and in my turn express the hope that next year we can return here under much better circumstances.</div>

Regrettably and significantly, our proposal was not accepted: the sponsors of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.22">A/56/L.22</a> agreed that reference should be made to terrorist acts and to the need to put an end to terrorist acts because they are convinced that such acts are illegal and harmful to peace and should be condemned.

	<div class="p">My delegation is grateful to all delegations that voted in favour of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-56-L.24">A/56/L.24</a>, entitled "The Syrian Golan". The Assembly's adoption of that draft resolution means a great deal to our people and to all those struggling for liberation and for an end to foreign occupation.</div>
	<div class="p">The resolution sends a clear and unambiguous message that is beyond doubt: that occupation is unacceptable and has been rejected; that the building of settlements and the trampling of the rights of peoples are unacceptable and have been utterly rejected.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly has sent a very clear message to Israel about the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force. This is something that concerns all the world's peoples; all countries want an end to this occupation. The resolution further expresses the Assembly's deep concern at the fact that Israel has not withdrawn from the Syrian Golan, which has been under occupation since 1967, contrary to the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The Assembly is thus clearly announcing a policy that should be understood by the party that occupies the territories of others. The Assembly has also declared that the Israeli decision of 14 December 1981 to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and has no validity whatsoever. It determines once more that Israel's continued occupation of the Syrian Golan and its de facto annexation constitute a stumbling block in the way of achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.</div>
	<div class="p">The voice of the international community should be heard. The occupying Power should listen to this voice and should understand that the current situation cannot be resolved without its withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and the restoration of the legitimate, inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Any attempts to distract the attention of the international community from the real reason behind all the problems that the Middle East is facing as a result of the Israeli occupation are doomed. Peace and security are integral; one cannot be achieved without the other.</div>

	<div class="p">I must also confess that I do not understand what the representative of Israel said regarding the results of the vote, except that the traditional position of Israel is one that does not respect the absolute majority of Assembly members. Israel has rejected all United Nations resolutions -- those of the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and so forth. Not a single resolution has been adopted in favour of the point of view of Israel, and for the simple reason that it is illegitimate. It runs contrary to the provisions of international law and those of the United Nations Charter.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolutions that were adopted today fall into this context. It is my hope that the representative of Israel -- that the Government of Israel -- will understand the pronouncements of the international community as they are, rather than what they wish them to be.</div>
	<div class="p">As a representative of a people under long-term occupation, I feel extreme pain. I sincerely feel pain when the representative of Israel lectures us about morality as to what should or should not be; he is simply representing an occupying force. On the same moral basis, could we possibly expect him to condemn foreign occupation? Could we hear him condemn State-sponsored terrorism? Could we hear him condemn extrajudicial executions? And could he condemn the continued serious violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention? How about war crimes? Settler colonialism? Bringing colonialists and settlers to our land? The acquisition of one third of Gaza's territory to give to 4,000 settlers and the expulsion of more than 1 million Palestinians living below the line of poverty?</div>
	<div class="p">Israel's immoral and illegitimate practices have caused hatred, anger and rejection of Israel's colonialism. We do not condone such practices. The representative of Israel should not try to give the impression that what he represents is a moral position. The Israeli practices run contrary to all morals and ethics, and putting an end to such practices is a sine qua non for peace. Do not push the Palestinian people even further. Do not try to drag the region into a total war. What you have practised against our people is more than enough. It is enough.</div>
