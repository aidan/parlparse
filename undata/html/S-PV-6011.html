<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now proceed to the election of five members of the International Court of Justice, in accordance with Article 13 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, to fill the five seats which will become vacant on 5 February 2009 on the expiry of the terms of office of the following Judges: Judge Ronny Abraham (France), Judge Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh (Jordan), Judge Rosalyn Higgins (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), Judge Gonzalo Parra-Aranguren (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) and Judge Raymond Ranjeva (Madagascar).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The list of candidates indicating the national groups by which each candidate was nominated is contained in documents <a href="../pdf/S-2008-503.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/503</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2008-503-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">Add.1</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2008-503-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">Add.2</a>. In that connection, I should like to draw the attention of members to the note by the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2008-503-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2008/503/Add.2</a>, in which he reports that the national group of Colombia decided to withdraw its nomination of Mr. Rafael Nieto Navia as a candidate. Since Mr. Nieto Navia was nominated only by the national group of Colombia, his name is not included on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I should like to inform the members of the Council that I have received a letter addressed to me by the Legal Counsel, dated 4 November 2008, informing me, on behalf of the Secretary-General, that after the established deadline for the filing of nominations, namely 30 June 2008, several national groups submitted nominations to the Secretariat. I should like to draw members' attention to the fact that all such additional nominations relate to candidates already nominated by other national groups, whose names therefore already appear in documents <a href="../pdf/S-2008-503.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/503</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2008-503-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">Add.1</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2008-503-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">Add.2</a>. The Legal Counsel recommended that, in accordance with established practice, I inform Council members orally on the day of the election about the decisions of the aforementioned national groups. I am also informed that the Legal Counsel made a similar recommendation to the President of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">The nominations of the aforementioned national groups are as follows: for Mr. Ronny Abraham, Italy, the Russian Federation and Uruguay; for Mr. Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, Italy, Paraguay and Uruguay; for Mr. Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade, Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay, Spain and Uruguay; for Mr. Christopher Greenwood, Italy and the Russian Federation; and for Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, Italy and Uruguay.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">The Security Council has before it a memorandum by the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2008-502.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2008/502</a>, describing the present composition of the Court and setting out the procedure to be followed in the conduct of the election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">I should like to remind the Council that under Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"Those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of votes in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">The required majority in the Security Council is eight votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">If, in the first ballot, the number of candidates obtaining an absolute majority is less than five, then pursuant to rule 61 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council, the Council will proceed to a second ballot on the remaining vacancies. Balloting will continue in the same manner until five candidates have obtained the required majority of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">If, on the other hand, more than five candidates obtain the required majority, according to established practice and as set forth in paragraph 13 of the Secretary-General's memorandum, a new vote will be held on all the candidates. That rule will also apply to any subsequent ballots if the number of candidates obtaining the absolute majority is greater than the number of vacancies remaining.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">The voting will be held by secret ballot. When we proceed to the vote, members of the Council will receive a ballot containing the names of all the candidates. No candidacy withdrawal will be accepted once the ballot papers have been distributed. However, it will be possible to withdraw a candidacy between ballots.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">Members of the Council will be requested to place an "X" in the boxes next to the names of the candidates for whom they wish to vote. Only those candidates whose names appear on the ballot are eligible for election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">I should like to remind members of paragraph 10 of the Secretary-General's memorandum (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-502.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/502</a>), which specifies that "Each elector may vote for not more than five candidates on the first ballot". Any ballot paper containing votes for more than five names will be considered invalid.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">I should like to inform Council members that, in accordance with established practice, the ballot papers in the Security Council will not be counted until it has been verified that the ballot papers in the General Assembly have also been collected. The Council will remain in session pending the receipt of that information.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">Only when five candidates have obtained the required majority of votes in the Security Council shall I communicate the result to the President of the General Assembly. I shall request the Council to remain in session, pending the receipt from the President of the General Assembly of the result of the voting in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">The Council will now proceed to draw lots to select two delegations to serve as tellers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa17">The delegations of France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland will not be considered to serve as tellers because candidates of those two nationalities have been nominated. Because my delegation this month occupies the Council presidency, it will also be excluded from serving as a teller.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa18">In this box are the names of the 12 other delegations that can serve as tellers. I will now draw two.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa19">The delegations of China and Belgium have been chosen. I invite those delegations to appoint one of their members to serve as teller.</p>
