<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">"The Security Council recalls all its previous resolutions on Lebanon, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1559 (2004)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf" class="pdf">425 (1978)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-426(1978).pdf" class="pdf">426 (1978)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-520(1982).pdf" class="pdf">520 (1982)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1680(2006).pdf" class="pdf">1680 (2006)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">1701 (2006)</a>, as well as the statements of its president on the situation in Lebanon, in particular the statements of 18 June 2000, 19 October 2004, 4 May 2005, 23 January 2006, 30 October 2006, 12 December 2006 and 17 April 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">"The Security Council welcomes the fifth semi-annual report to the Security Council of 7 May 2007 on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the legitimate and democratically-elected Government of Lebanon, calls for full respect for the democratic institutions of the country, in conformity with its constitution, and condemns any effort to destabilize Lebanon. The Security Council calls upon all Lebanese political parties to show responsibility with a view to preventing, through dialogue, further deterioration of the situation in Lebanon. Recognizing the need to hold free and fair presidential elections in conformity with the Lebanese constitution and without any foreign interference and influence, the Security Council urges political parties in Lebanon to relaunch a national dialogue with the aim to reach an agreement to settle all political issues.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms its strong support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty, unity and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized borders and under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Council condemns the ongoing criminal and terrorist acts in Lebanon, including those perpetrated by Fatah al-Islam, and fully supports the efforts carried out by the Lebanese Government and army to ensure security and stability throughout Lebanon. The Council underlines the need to protect and give assistance to the civilian population, notably the Palestinian refugees. The Council reiterates that there should be no weapons in Lebanon without the consent of its Government and no authority other than that of its Government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council notes with appreciation that further progress has been made towards the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a>, in particular through the extension of the authority of the Government of Lebanon throughout its territory, particularly in the South, but it also notes with regret that some provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a> have yet to be fully implemented, particularly the disbanding and disarming of Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias, the strict respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity, and political independence of Lebanon, and free and fair presidential elections conducted according to the Lebanese constitutional rules, without any foreign interference and influence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its deep concern at mounting information by Israel and other States of illegal movements of arms into Lebanon, and in particular across the Lebanese-Syrian border, and looks forward to the conclusions of the Lebanon Independent Border Assessment Team. It reiterates its call for the strict respect for Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity, including its air space.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council reiterates its call for the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a> and urges all concerned States and parties, as mentioned in the report, to cooperate fully with the Government of Lebanon, the Security Council and the Secretary-General to achieve this goal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"The Security Council reaffirms its support to the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy in their efforts and dedication to facilitate and assist in the implementation of all provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1559 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1680(2006).pdf" class="pdf">1680 (2006)</a> and looks forward to the Secretary-General's next report on implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1701(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1701 (2006)</a> and to his further recommendations on the relevant outstanding issues."</p>
