	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01"> The General Assembly will now proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">As members will recall, when the 35th plenary meeting was adjourned, on Tuesday afternoon, 17 October 2006, there remained one seat from among the Latin American and Caribbean States to be filled. In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the next round of balloting by secret ballot. This twenty-third round of balloting will, in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, also be the tenth unrestricted ballot.</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">I have a procedural question before we begin the balloting. We would like to propose that we establish some kind of a timeframe for the voting process, because we have committee meetings and other engagements and matters to attend to. With its indulgence, therefore, we would ask the presidency to clarify, before the end of the day, how the process will be structured -- without, of course, getting into substantive questions regarding candidatures and so on. We have other committee work and engagements. My proposal, therefore, is to devote two or three days per week to this issue. I also propose that the General Assembly take into consideration the Id al-Fitr holiday, and not schedule any votes on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
