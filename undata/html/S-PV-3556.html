	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council, recalling its previous resolutions, is deeply concerned by the situation in and around the safe area of Zepa. It condemns in the strongest possible terms the offensive by the Bosnian Serb forces against that safe area. The Security Council is also concerned in particular at the plight of the civilian population there.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council attaches the utmost importance to the safety and well-being of the civilian population in Zepa. It demands that the Bosnian Serb forces refrain from any further action that threatens the safety of that population, and that they respect fully the rights of the civilian population and other persons protected under international humanitarian law. The Council reaffirms its condemnation of all violations of international humanitarian law, and reiterates to all concerned that those who have committed or ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts. It reminds the military and political leaders of the Bosnian Serb party that this responsibility extends to any such acts committed by forces under their command.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council underlines the importance it attaches to the fullest cooperation with UNHCR and other international humanitarian organizations, and demands that they be given unhindered freedom of movement and access to that area. It further demands that the Bosnian Serb authorities cooperate with all efforts, including those of UNPROFOR, to ensure the safety of the civilian population, and in particular its most vulnerable members, including evacuation as requested by the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in his letter of 17 July 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-582.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/582</a>, annex).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council strongly condemns the recent acts of violence and intimidation which have occurred against the personnel of UNPROFOR. It demands that both parties ensure the safety and freedom of movement of UNPROFOR personnel at all times."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-33.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/33</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
