<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">I should like at the outset to apologize to members of the Council and to other speakers for being late. As I said during our consultations, I had to represent the Security Council at a meeting of the Economic and Social Council, at which I had to speak. That meeting was late in getting started, which made me late for our meeting here; I apologize for that.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">If there is no objection, we will suspend the meeting at 6 p.m. and resume it at 3 p.m. on Monday.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa03">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haraguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">Mr. President, I wish to thank you for convening this public meeting of the Security Council. I shall be very brief.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">On the anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States, we vividly recalled the sense of tremendous panic and profound grief caused by such brutal acts. We could not but have heartfelt sympathy for the victims and their bereaved families. At the same time, we all had a sense of our own vulnerability, knowing that terrorists could strike anywhere, at any time.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">Although much progress has been made in the fight against terrorism, the struggle must be ongoing. Only through steadfast vigilance and a comprehensive approach, with efforts made by each State, as well as determined cooperation at the regional and international levels, can we have some assurance that such acts of terrorism will not be repeated.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa04">First, as part of its own efforts to combat terrorism, in June Japan deposited its instruments of acceptance of the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In so doing it became party to all twelve international anti-terrorism conventions. Japan hopes that every State will likewise conclude all of the anti-terrorism conventions. At the same time, we believe it is also important to further strengthen the international framework by adopting such conventions as the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Japan will continue to work towards this goal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa05">Secondly, I wish to refer to cooperation at the regional level. In Tokyo on l and 2 October, Japan co-hosted with the Republic of Korea and Singapore the Second ASEAN Regional Forum Workshop on counter-terrorism measures. The discussions at the Workshop focused on how we might make more concrete international cooperative efforts, based on the recommendation made at the first Workshop in Bangkok. As a result of the very fruitful discussions held there, we completed work on the paper entitled "Best Practices for Counter-Terrorism Measures in Major International Events". The Workshop thus offered a valuable opportunity to strengthen regional efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa06">Thirdly, cooperative efforts to combat terrorism at the international level are especially crucial. Japan therefore remains committed to fully supporting the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). I would like in particular to point out the important role of the CTC in facilitating global implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. As Japan has repeatedly stressed, developing countries which are facing difficulties in implementing that resolution must be provided with international assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa07">The CTC's directory of assistance is an important mechanism for the coordination of such assistance. For its part, Japan is now considering extending assistance to those countries, using as a reference the information provided by the Committee's distinguished expert, Ambassador Curtis A. Ward.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa08">In closing, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the CTC, and to the other members of the bureau for their excellent work, which they have conducted in a very transparent manner. I would also like to refer to the efforts of Ambassador Alfonso Valdivieso, Chairman of the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, and his staff. Without their dedication and extraordinary contributions, the Security Council, I am afraid, could not have accomplished its tasks so successfully. I wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to them as well.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Yemen. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Alsaidi</span> <span class="nation">Yemen</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">Before taking up the substance of the item, I would first like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council. We are fully confident that you will conduct the Council's work wisely. We would also like to express our gratitude to your predecessor for presiding over the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">We would like to commend the activities and vigorous efforts of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Committee is undertaking concrete activities that are undoubtedly commensurate with the gravity of the terrorist crimes that manifested themselves in the most heinous form of criminal attacks on the United States of America in September 2001. Those painful events alerted the peoples and Governments of the world to terrorism's devastating effects in all its forms and manifestations. Suffice it to say that international unanimity on combating and eliminating terrorism has become a top priority in the system of international cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">However, as far as we know, the dangers posed by acts of terrorism and the way to eliminate the roots of terrorism in all its forms and causes requires clarity of vision, unanimity of views and seriousness of purpose on our part. It is logical that collective will cannot be accomplished outside the framework of international law and legitimacy.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> laid the foundation for legitimate, coordinated international action, but we still need a legal framework that could govern our State policies and Government practices, either individually or collectively.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">The delegation of the Republic of Yemen has spared no effort in striving for success in the current negotiations on the first draft international convention that India, to its credit, has formulated. We feel that the slow progress of these negotiations is evidence of the desire that the proposed convention reflect the various points of view and serve as a true expression of the collective will. In this regard, we would like to affirm the view of numerous States that the convention must cover all acts of terrorism, whether they are undertaken by individuals, groups or States.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">We cannot envision, nor can we accept, any formula that would deny peoples their legitimate right to resist occupation. We insist on differentiating between "terrorism" and "legitimate resistance by all possible means against foreign occupation".</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">My country was among the first to call attention to the dangers of terrorism, and we called for concerted international and regional efforts early on to tackle these dangers. Arab and Islamic States, including my own, have ratified the majority of relevant conventions. However, my country has been a victim of terrorist acts and their devastating effects, which have adversely affected the development process and have inflicted severe damage on our national economy for more than a decade.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">We were given grounds for optimism with regard to international cooperation through the Committee established by the Council. We affirmed our cooperation with it and presented the requisite national report, which is contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-240.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/240</a>. The cooperation that we have affirmed in practice and the actions taken by our Government to confront terrorism and eliminate it within our borders are of utmost importance. The mass media have spared me the need to discuss these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">Once again, we reiterate the readiness of the Republic of Yemen to continue promoting international cooperation in order to eliminate the scourge of terrorism and to prevent the risks thereof.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">I thank the representative of Yemen for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Australia, whom I invite to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dauth</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">A year after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the international community, the Security Council and, of course, in particular the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) under Ambassador Greenstock's energetic chairmanship, can take justified pride in what has been accomplished, particularly in putting in place the legislative framework to fight terrorism and suppress its financing. Sir Jeremy Greenstock and his colleagues, I think, are particularly to be congratulated on really quite outstanding work. And as Sir Jeremy will know well, it is unusual for an Australian to heap such praise on an Englishman.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">But our work is beginning, rather than ending. Terrorism remains a significant and evolving threat to international peace and security. Our defence against terrorism is only as strong as its weakest link. Much remains to be done by States individually, by regional groups and multilaterally. Universal fulfilment of obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> must remain our key priority. National legislation needs to be strong and comprehensive. Adherence to all 12 anti-terrorism conventions needs to be global. And we need to ensure active implementation of legislation, assisted where necessary by strengthening the institutional capacities of those States where these are lacking.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">Australia is strongly committed to playing an energetic and creative role in the fight against terrorism. We take our obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> with the utmost seriousness. Australia is now a party to 11 of the 12 anti-terrorism conventions. We acceded to the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings this August, and ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism last month. We are actively considering our position with regard to the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa04">Within our own region, Australia continues to encourage greater cooperation to combat terrorism. As set out in detail in the Pacific Islands Forum statement, delivered by my colleague, the distinguished Ambassador of Fiji, the Nasonini Declaration on Regional Security was adopted by the Pacific Islands Forum on 17 August 2002, affirming the need for immediate and sustained regional action in response to terrorist threats. Australia also sponsored with the United States, New Zealand and the Forum Secretariat a counter-terrorism workshop for Pacific Island countries in March.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa05">Australia and Indonesia announced in September that they will co-host a regional conference on combating money-laundering and terrorist financing in December this year. The conference will augment and contribute to existing initiatives being undertaken by the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and other organizations. Australia and Indonesia believe that the meeting will enable countries in our region to strengthen further their individual efforts to prevent and counter money-laundering and the financing of terrorism, particularly by identifying capacity-building needs to meet existing and new obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa06">Australia has also been active in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum context. Together with Thailand we chaired an ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) workshop on terrorism prevention in Bangkok in April 2002. We were pleased to be part of the ASEAN Regional Forum's Declaration on Terrorist Financing at its Ministerial Meeting on 31 July 2002, as well as in the creation of an intersessional mechanism on terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa07">In addition to these regional initiatives, we consider that bilateral cooperation between Governments is also critical in combating terrorism, especially in the exchange of information and intelligence to identify terrorist threats at the earliest possible stage. Australia is seeking closer law enforcement cooperation with partners in our region and has negotiated Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) on counter-terrorism cooperation with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa08">Australia remains a very strong supporter of the CTC. We have provided an expert to the Committee and have nominated three additional experts to be called upon by the Committee as required.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa09">As the CTC embarks on its second year, it can be assured of Australia's ongoing support. We will also continue to work vigorously within the United Nations and elsewhere to defeat international terrorism, and we encourage other States to do likewise.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Australia for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ouch</span> <span class="nation">Cambodia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">I have the honour of speaking on behalf of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), namely Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">May I, first of all, congratulate you, Mr. President, for assuming the presidency of the Council this month, and thank the Secretary-General for his inspiring speech. I wish also to thank the Chairman of the CTC, His Excellency Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the Vice-Chairmen, the Committee members and all experts involved, as well as the United Nations Secretariat for their dedication and hard work.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">We appreciate the impressive progress made by the CTC in its first year, whereby over 90 per cent of Member States have reported to the CTC on the action taken and planned, and a large percentage of them have completed their follow-up reports. We are pleased to inform you that all ASEAN member States have already submitted their initial reports and, at this stage, are further progressing towards fulfilling the next requirements of the CTC. We also note from the CTC Chairman's statement today that, for most States, priority will have to be placed in the following two areas: first, having legislation in place covering all aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and a process in hand to ratify as soon as possible the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, and secondly, having effective executive machinery for preventing and suppressing the financing of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">We appreciate the efforts made by the CTC to facilitate the provision of necessary technical assistance to Member States. In this regard, we welcome the establishment of the web site, which makes available a comprehensive directory of counter-terrorism information and sources of technical assistance. We wish to reiterate that we would welcome further assistance from the CTC to ASEAN member States to strengthen their capacity in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Allow me, Mr. President, to give a further update on ASEAN's ongoing efforts to combat international terrorism since the last meeting on the subject on 27 June 2002. The ASEAN Foreign Ministers, at their meeting held from 29-30 July 2002 in Brunei Darussalam, expressed their determination to enhance counter-terrorism cooperation, and affirmed the major role of the United Nations in combating terrorism at the international level. The Ministers also expressed their full support for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">In addition, there have been a number of agreements and specific action plans that ASEAN and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) have put in place in order to tackle threats of terrorism in our region. For example, at the recent ninth meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum, the participants agreed to implement quickly and decisively measures that the United Nations has identified as mandatory to combat the financing of terrorism. The participants also agreed to enhance their ability to share information, domestically and internationally, as a vital component in the fight against terrorism. The participants also welcomed the establishment of inter-sessional meetings (ISMs) as avenues to discuss concrete measures of how ARF members can enhance their cooperation against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">In August this year, ASEAN member States and the United States signed an anti-terrorism declaration as a framework for increased cooperation to prevent and combat global terrorism, recognizing the principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and non-interference in domestic affairs of other States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Countering terrorism remains high on the agenda of ASEAN member States, both individually and collectively. I would like to take this opportunity to reassure you of ASEAN's continued commitment and cooperation to prevent, counter and suppress all terrorist acts in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, all relevant United Nations resolutions and, in particular, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, as well as the principles of international law.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa01">Today's meeting offers a good opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved in our common fight against international terrorism, as well as to look ahead to the future. At the outset, we would like to offer some thoughts on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa02">We all owe gratitude above all to Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, who has guided the work of the Committee with exemplary circumspection and transparency. Given the sensitive tasks of the CTC, his leadership has played a decisive role in ensuring a prominent place for the Committee. Liechtenstein has accorded high priority to its cooperation with the CTC, in particular in the light of the strong focus that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> places on the issue of the financing of terrorism. We have submitted to the Committee in a timely manner a report and a supplementary report, and we have engaged in a fruitful dialogue on issues relating to implementation. We have ratified 10 out of the 12 anti-terrorism conventions. We look forward to the early ratification of the remaining two, as soon as we have enacted the relevant implementing legislation, as is the practice in our country.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa03">It is encouraging to note that most States have extended full and constructive cooperation to the CTC and that, where full cooperation was not forthcoming, that was due more often to inability than to unwillingness. The CTC has thus had a tremendous impact, in particular by also reaching out to other organizations -- especially regional organizations -- to ensure full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa04">Looking to the future, we are of the view that standards will be necessary to ensure a minimum level of compliance at the global level. The standards to be observed were set a year ago, and a set of minimum requirements will be needed to ensure the effectiveness of those standards and, thus, of the work of the Committee. We agree with the philosophy of the CTC, that the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is a process and that no State is perfect when it comes to implementation. Enhancing compliance will therefore be of crucial importance in the second phase of the Committee's work. My Government has offered our expertise to the Counter-Terrorism Committee in the past, and our offer still stands.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa05">The rule of law has become a predominant theme in the overall fight against terrorism. We remain convinced that human rights must never fall victim to the fight against terrorism. Our common fight against terrorism must not jeopardize the existing human rights standards, which are among the greatest achievements of the Organization. If we were to curtail human rights in the name of the fight against terrorism, we would be making a fatal concession by sacrificing some of our most fundamental values, the very values that terrorists set out to destroy. While the danger posed by terrorism is certainly unprecedented in its magnitude, existing standards nevertheless provide a balance between the enjoyment of human rights and security concerns in that they allow for the limitation of some human rights under clearly defined circumstances. At the same time, there is also a set of irrevocable human rights. Those solid human rights achievements must not be touched.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa06">It is not only States that are called upon to uphold the rule of law at the national level. Indeed, the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, are challenged to live up to their obligation to uphold the rule of law at the international level. Individuals suspected of being involved in terrorist activities must be guaranteed the minimum standards of protection accorded to them by international law. The Security Council, more than any other body, is called upon to respect those rights. In particular, it must ensure that there is never a conflict for States between their obligation to fully observe human rights standards and their obligation to implement decisions of the Security Council.</p>

Let me also thank you for convening this public meeting on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). We believe that today's meeting offers a valuable opportunity for the wider membership of the United Nations to share its views on a subject of the utmost importance.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">More than a year has passed since the horrendous acts of terrorism of September 2001. Since then, with the CTC standing at the forefront of our global efforts in the fight against terrorism, the resolve of the international community has been further strengthened and its readiness significantly enhanced. In that regard, I would like to express my delegation's appreciation to Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock for his outstanding leadership in steering the work of the CTC. Our appreciation goes also to his team at the United Kingdom Mission, as well as to the independent experts and the Secretariat staff, for their dedicated efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">We have recorded important progress following the Security Council's adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which laid down a comprehensive road map to combat terrorism. The concerted action taken by the international community has led to the dismantling of many terrorist networks and the disrupting of their channels of financial support. In that common endeavour, it is noteworthy that global participation and cooperation have been consistent and pervasive, as reflected by the fact that more than 170 States have submitted their reports to the CTC on steps taken under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">My delegation notes that the CTC is now focusing its work on reviewing the second reports submitted by Member States, identifying gaps in domestic legislation and Government machinery in the field of counter-terrorism and proposing future measures to be taken by national Governments. We also note the expanding focus of the CTC regarding its framework of cooperation with other international, regional and subregional organizations and its role in facilitating assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">My Government in June 2002 submitted its second report to the CTC and that report is now under review by the Committee. The Republic of Korea welcomes the CTC's work programme for the coming months and stands ready to lend its full support.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">On the national level, the Republic of Korea has been according paramount importance to the issue of counter-terrorism. Our specific measures to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> include the establishment and active operation of the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KFIU) to prevent and combat terrorist financing. As far as the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism are concerned, the Republic of Korea is currently a party to eight of those legal instruments. Two other instruments, on unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation and of fixed platforms located on the continental shelf, have now been placed before the National Assembly for its consideration, with a view to our accession to them by the end of this year.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">Furthermore, we are expediting the process of early ratification of the two remaining conventions, on the suppression of the financing of terrorism and on the suppression of terrorist bombings, which we have already signed.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">The Republic of Korea has also been continuing its active participation in regional forums related to counter-terrorism. Within the context of such regional endeavours, my Government, along with the Governments of Japan and Singapore, co-hosted the Second Workshop on Counter-Terrorism of the Association of South-East Asian Nations Regional Forum, which was held in Tokyo on 1 and 2 October 2002. On that occasion, we presented, among other things, the successful anti-terrorism measures taken during the 2002 FIFA World Cup tournament held in Korea and Japan, which could contribute to the establishment of best practices in managing major international events.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">In the global efforts to fight terrorism, my Government attaches great importance to following up on the initiatives of the Financial Action Task Force in the field of combating terrorist financing, and hopes to become a member of that body upon the expansion of its membership.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">As the CTC enters its second year of work, we believe that it would be useful to find ways to disseminate the achievements of the CTC in the fight against international terrorism to a wider arena. The CTC's experience and expertise, based on its in-depth reviews of national reports covering nearly all corners of the world, could offer the best source of wisdom with regard to our common endeavour to eliminate the threat of terrorism. Given the still incomplete international legal regime in this field, the strengths, setbacks and patterns of national counter-terrorism measures identified by the CTC would be of particular benefit to the relevant deliberations in the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">Because the global menace of terrorism has not been entirely eliminated, as reflected in the recently published report of a United Nations monitoring group, my delegation believes that the international community should remain fully vigilant about such threats under the guiding role of the CTC. In that regard, I would like to reiterate the unswerving commitment of the Republic of Korea to fighting the scourge of terrorism in an effective, comprehensive and sustained manner. We also reaffirm our full support for the mandate of the CTC to enable all States to expand their capacity and readiness to counter terrorism on all fronts.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of the Republic of Korea for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mejdoub</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Please allow me at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you and all the other members of your delegation on your accession to the presidency of the Council. Let me assure you as well of our complete cooperation in the fulfilment of your duties. My congratulations go also to your predecessor, Ambassador Tafrov, for his excellent leadership of the work of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Please allow me also to thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this meeting, which marks one year since the first meeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). Today's meeting gives us the opportunity to report to members of the Council about the measures that Tunisia has taken to combat the grave threat posed by international terrorism. But first, I would like to join those who spoke before me to pay tribute to the sustained efforts made in this regard by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the Vice-Chairmen of the Committee, the other representatives of CTC members, the experts and the Secretariat staff.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Tunisia, which was among the first nations to warn against the dangers of terrorism, is firmly committed to continue its work to strengthen cooperation aimed at effectively countering and finally eliminating this scourge. Therefore, beyond its multi-dimensional, comprehensive national counter-terrorism policy, Tunisia has signed bilateral agreements with 30 countries with a view to strengthening its cooperation with those countries in the legal and security areas. Furthermore, Tunisia has adhered to regional conventions adopted by the League of Arab States, the Organization of African Unity and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as to the 12 international conventions on specific terrorism issues.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Tunisia has also made many initiatives. Among these was the call by President Ben Ali to hold an international conference that would lay down common parameters for a code of conduct for all States. It would help initiate a responsible dialogue that would avoid double standards in regional conflicts and mitigate the feelings of deprivation and oppression experienced by many peoples.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">As a member of the Council at the time, Tunisia actively participated in the formulation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In compliance with this resolution, we have submitted to the Counter-Terrorism Committee two reports dealing with the measures taken in this regard, and we remain ready to respond to any new request from the Committee. Furthermore, my country has given effective support to the CTC, in particular by designating an expert in counter-terrorism law.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">During its term in the Council, Tunisia stressed the need to guarantee maximum transparency in the Committee's work. We also urged that technical assistance be provided to the States to enable them to fulfil <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and called for equitable geographic representation in the selection of experts working with the CTC. One year later, we note with great satisfaction that the Committee is working resolutely in that direction.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">In that regard, we are grateful to Sir Jeremy for organizing periodic briefings with non-member States. We are also pleased by the Committee's increased cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations and institutions, as well as by its continued efforts to obtain financing and specialized technical support.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa01">Before concluding, I wish to underline two points of major importance to my delegation. First, the comprehensive strategy to prevent and fight terrorism should not jeopardize the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination or the legitimate struggle of peoples against foreign and colonial occupation. It is essential not to confuse those rights, recognized and protected by the Charter and by international law, with acts of terrorism targeting civilian populations. A clear definition agreed upon by all States would definitely help avoid that confusion.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa02">Secondly, the fight against terrorism requires that we attack its root causes. Thus, it is necessary to tackle all manifestations of poverty and underdevelopment wherever they occur, work resolutely to eliminate causes of frustration and deprivation and resolve major pending issues so that they cannot be exploited by terrorist groups wishing to harm international stability.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Løj</span> <span class="nation">Denmark</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The Central and Eastern Europe countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated countries Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European Free Trade Association country member of the European Economic Area Iceland, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir, and your delegation upon assuming the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. The European Union pledges to cooperate fully with you in your important tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The European Union welcomes the opportunity to once again review the work of the Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). At the outset, the European Union would like to express its strong support for the work of the Committee and for its efforts to make its activities as transparent as possible. Likewise, we commend the great effort made by the members of the Committee, its experts and the Secretariat to process and analyse the wealth of information provided in the reports.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">The fight against terrorism remains an absolute priority for the European Union. In that regard, we acknowledge the central role of the United Nations, through the Security Council and the CTC, and we remain fully committed to the closest and fullest cooperation with the Committee, in the spirit of paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">As the Chairman of the CTC outlined this morning, the second phase of the review of national and other reports is well under way. We urge those who have not yet submitted an initial or a subsequent report to do so.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">However, the European Union reiterates that compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is not met through the mere presentation of reports. We have to move beyond words if we are to be successful in our attempts to eliminate international terrorism. It is, therefore, essential to fully implement the resolution by adopting and implementing the necessary legal and practical measures at the national and regional levels.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">As we have heard again and again, there must be no weak links in the chain. The European Union fully agrees with this and, thus, stands ready to assist third countries. There is scope for further assistance, and we encourage those in need of assistance to provide specific requests in that regard. An overview of EU assistance programmes appears on the CTC's web site.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">Furthermore, the European Union is stepping up its efforts to assist third countries in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We are identifying a number of countries with which to cooperate in launching pilot projects. That assistance will be based on an assessment of needs, on which we will be cooperating very closely with the CTC. The European Union reiterates the importance of effective and adequate coordination among donors in order to avoid duplication of work.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">Thus, the European Union intends to make progress to incorporate the fight against terrorism into all aspects of the Union's external policy, in particular by strengthening the role of the Common Foreign and Security Policy in that area: for instance, to include anti-terrorism clauses in EU agreements with third countries, to focus more sharply on a political dialogue with third countries and to actively promote coordination with relevant international and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">The European Union supports the report of the Policy Working Group on the United Nations and Terrorism. We underscore that the United Nations system as a whole should continue to ensure its readiness to assist in the implementation of measures to counter terrorism, in particular the efforts of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa11">The European Union continues to urge the speedy signing and ratification of all 12 international terrorism conventions, especially the one related to the financing of terrorism. In that context, we take note of the proposals of the Secretary-General to strengthen the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention. The EU also remains committed to finalizing the work on a draft comprehensive convention against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa12">The European Union emphasizes that our efforts to establish effective instruments to fight terrorism must be conducted with respect for the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We must not fall into the trap of responding to terrorist attacks by undermining our own democratic values. We, therefore, commend the contact the CTC has developed with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, the fight against terrorism requires a comprehensive approach and effective instruments for legal collaboration. That fight can be won only through strong and sustained international cooperation. The United Nations, most notably the CTC, will remain crucial in that regard, and the EU urges all Member States and international organizations to show their fullest commitment to this important cause.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">We are delighted to see you, Sir, assume the presidency of the Security Council at this critical moment for international peace and security and, indeed, a critical moment for the United Nations. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Stefan Tafrov, your predecessor, for his skilful and outstanding leadership of the Council last month. On this occasion, the Pakistan delegation extends its high appreciation to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), to the Vice-Chairmen of the CTC and to its experts for their endeavours over the past year. We wish them continued success in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">The debate on the issue of threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist attacks is important and timely. The catastrophic terrorist attacks of 11 September last year mobilized the international community to launch a comprehensive campaign against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">The Security Council has made a significant contribution to that campaign, including through the series of resolutions it has adopted -- <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1368(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1368 (2001)</a> calling on all States to work together to bring to justice "the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors" of the atrocities of 11 September; <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, adopted almost a year ago this week, which aimed at cutting off the supply lines -- financial, military and logistic -- of the terrorists; <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1377(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1377 (2001)</a> calling on all States to eliminate the scourge of terrorism; and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1390(2002).pdf" class="pdf">1390 (2002)</a> targeting Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">On the ground, an international coalition was quickly constituted and has waged a successful war against the Al Qaeda terrorist organization in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Almost a year later, Al Qaeda has been virtually destroyed and the Government which harboured and protected those terrorists ejected from power. The Bonn process, supplemented by the Tokyo Conference, has opened the way for the installation of a representative Government in Kabul, led by President Hamid Karzai, and for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">However, the war against terrorism in Afghanistan is not yet fully won. Coalition forces are still pursuing the remnants of Al Qaeda in the mountains and valleys of Afghanistan. That final mopping-up operation is likely to be painstaking and time-consuming. In the meantime, the international community, which has organized itself admirably in Afghanistan under the guidance of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, cannot afford to become complacent. Security continues to be under threat in Afghanistan from a variety of sources, including tribal and regional rivalries and the quest for power and influence. Pakistan continues to believe and to urge that the international community should deploy additional forces, especially in the regional centres, as a means of consolidating peace and security in Afghanistan and ensuring that the writ of President Karzai prevails over the entire country. Failure to take timely action to consolidate security in Afghanistan could prove to be very costly in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">It is equally important to commence the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction simultaneously throughout Afghanistan under the auspices of the Karzai Government. Apart from generating an economic revival and creating jobs, it will also help to extend the influence and authority of the Government in Kabul to all Afghanistan.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">Even as the international community acts to consolidate peace and security and to revive economic activity in Afghanistan, the need to support Pakistan in its multiple endeavours to combat terrorism should not be overlooked. As President Musharraf stated in the 2nd meeting of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, on 12 September:</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">"Pakistan is in the forefront of the fight against terrorism. We have made major sacrifices in this war. We have interdicted infiltration by Al Qaeda into Pakistan. We have arrested and deported foreign suspects found on our territory. We are determined not to allow anyone to use our soil for terrorist acts inside or outside Pakistan."</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">Pakistan continues to conduct extensive operations on its western border involving a sizeable number of its military and paramilitary forces to interdict Al Qaeda infiltration, even as coalition forces undertake simultaneous operations on the other side of the Durand Line.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">With equal vigour, Pakistan Government agencies are engaged in an extensive operation to hunt down Al Qaeda and other terrorists who may have infiltrated into Pakistan. Some have been discovered in the border regions, while others were found hiding in our cities. This intelligence and police operation has proved to be highly successful, resulting in the capture of some of the top leadership of Al Qaeda. We are confident of further and ultimate success in capturing any remaining Al Qaeda members on the run.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">It was expected that the terrorists, when cornered, would seek retaliation and revenge. In the war against terrorism, Pakistan has become not only the frontline fighter but also the frontline target of the terrorists. To draw publicity to their acts of vengeance and violence, the terrorists have focused on attacking foreigners, as well as members of Pakistan's Christian community. We condemn and deplore those attacks and the resulting loss of innocent lives. Yet the fact that the terrorists are attacking the innocent and "soft targets" is an indication that their capacities have been severely eroded. Pakistan is determined to pursue the operation until complete success is achieved in eliminating and eradicating those terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa12">It is unfortunate that in certain recent incidents of terrorism in Pakistan, we have found some grounds to suspect that there are external agencies other than Al Qaeda who may have been responsible for those terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa13">Just this morning there was a condemnable attack by gunmen against the girls' Islamic school in Lahore and another attack on a Christian hospital in Bannu, in north-western Pakistan. A young girl was injured in Lahore. Fortunately, there were no injuries in the Bannu attack.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa14">The Government of Pakistan is also seeking to clear the pond in which extremists and terrorists could survive. Through the detailed reports submitted by Pakistan to the CTC under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the Security Council is aware of the extensive legislative, administrative and operational measures which the Pakistani Government has adopted to arrest and eradicate all domestic manifestations of terrorism and extremism in Pakistan.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa15">Our campaign against terrorism and extremism is part of the endeavour of President Musharraf's Government to realize the vision of our founder, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, for the emergence of Pakistan as a modern, tolerant, democratic Islamic State. President Musharraf's Government has launched the country towards this vision, introducing comprehensive socio-economic reforms and restructuring our polity, inter alia, through grassroots democracy, the empowerment of women and an ambitious programme of human resources development, including education.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa16">As we move to the stage of completing the process of democratic revival with the holding of national and provincial assembly elections in Pakistan on 10 October -- six days away -- it is our hope and expectation that our friends in the international community will continue their support for Pakistan's comprehensive endeavour for rapid socio-economic development and to realize thereby our people's aspirations for peace, security and prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa17">It must be in the knowledge of the Council that Pakistan's ability to support the international struggle against terrorism -- and our aspirations for peace and prosperity -- could be significantly eroded by the military threat against Pakistan from our eastern neighbour. Misusing the rationale of the anti-terrorist campaign, this neighbour has deployed one million troops on Pakistan's border and along the Line of Control in Kashmir. It has repeatedly threatened to use force against Pakistan. It refuses mutual de-escalation of forces; it refuses bilateral dialogue; it refuses third-party mediation; it refuses the Secretary-General's good offices; and it refuses to end its military repression of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, justifying this stance by denigrating this noble freedom struggle as cross-border terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa18">The Kashmiris are struggling to exercise their right to self-determination, as promised to them by the Security Council in a number of resolutions. Those Security Council resolutions must also be faithfully implemented.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa19">If the war against terrorism is to be brought to a successful conclusion, it is vital to ensure that it is in no way misappropriated by interested parties who want to suppress the fundamental right of peoples under colonial and alien occupation or domination to struggle for their right to self-determination and freedom. As the President of Pakistan also stated in the General Assembly,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg010-bk02-pa20">"acts of terrorism by individuals or groups cannot be the justification to outlaw the just struggle of a people for self-determination and liberation from colonial or foreign occupation, nor can it justify State terrorism."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa21">There is another, less recognized threat to the successful conclusion of the anti-terrorist campaign -- the danger of unwittingly provoking a clash of religions and cultures. Obviously, some quarters have a vested interest in utilizing the war against terrorism as a vehicle to spread hatred against Islam and Muslims. Some of these people live close to us. But let us remember: terrorism has a history; but it has no religion or creed. In his address to the General Assembly, President Musharraf also said:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg010-bk02-pa22">"In a globalized world, religious and cultural diversity should be a vehicle for complementary creativity and dynamism, not the rationale for a new ideological or political confrontation."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa23">The veil of mutual suspicion and ignorance between the West and Islam, which has become so visible over the last year, can be lifted only through an open, honest and sustained dialogue. The President of Pakistan has proposed that, as a first step, the General Assembly should adopt a declaration on religious and cultural understanding, harmony and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa24">The attempt to equate Islam and Muslims with terrorism is exacerbating discrimination against Muslim minorities and peoples in various parts of the world. Unless this trend is reversed, it could result in another age-old manifestation of terrorism: organized pogroms against minorities and suppressed peoples, such as the one the world witnessed against the Muslims of Gujarat earlier this year.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa25">Even as we take practical and legal measures to combat the phenomenon of terrorism, the international community must initiate comprehensive and effective steps to address the root causes of terrorism. Terrorism often arises from political and economic injustice; from foreign occupation and the repression of peoples; from festering disputes and conflict among nations; and from economic deprivation and poverty, which provides a fertile field in which fanaticism flourishes. The efforts of the Security Council to eliminate terrorist threats must therefore embrace the endeavour to address these root causes of terrorism, in particular through the promotion of just and peaceful solutions to conflicts and disputes and of prosperity for all peoples.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Adamia</span> <span class="nation">Georgia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">Today's meeting has a special significance for my country as this is the first time that we have spoken in the Security Council since we joined the global anti-terrorist coalition. In this connection, I would like to commend the members of the Security Council for mobilizing the coordinated efforts of the international community against international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">I would like to express our support for and appreciation of the central role played by the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and its Chairman, Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock. We fully share the aims and objectives outlined by the Chairman for the next working period.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">The work of the Committee inspired a process of review of domestic legislation in my country to bring it into line with our obligations both under the conventions against terrorism and under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Government of Georgia recently approved a draft law on amendments to the criminal code of Georgia, and submitted it to the parliament for adoption. Domestic legislation on charitable and humanitarian organizations is also being reviewed to prevent money-laundering and any subsequent financing of terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">We are particularly pleased that the CTC remains focused on the timely provision of assistance to States and on capacity-building in order to address the threat of terrorism within the framework of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In this respect, we note the importance of dispatching an assessment mission to Georgia.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">The objective of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is to set out a legal and political framework for the undertaking by States of cooperative efforts in the process of fighting international terrorism. It is both a means- and goal-oriented resolution, and any attempt to expand its scope to manipulate it to one's own liking would undermine the very cornerstone of current international law and the Charter-based international system.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">Let me be candid. What is the real value of our deliberations and the commitments made in this Chamber given that Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, itself subjects my country to daily terror, intimidation and the threat of aggression. The flames of anti-Georgia hysteria that Russia's mass media continuously fan are fuelled by accusations that Georgia is not only not fighting the terrorists but, worse still, condoning them.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">I beg your pardon, Mr. President, but I have to say that sometimes it appears that whole sections of the United Nations Charter that set out the functions of the Security Council are completely missing from the memory of the Russian decision makers.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">In order to provide an objective picture of events and to dispel any doubts, I will resort only to the facts. In line with our obligations to suppress and prevent terrorist acts under anti-terrorist conventions and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, we launched and completed an anti-terrorist and anti-criminal operation in Georgia's Pankisi Gorge. The operation, which has been praised by the State Department of the United States and by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, would never have been possible without the decisive assistance of the United States. We have already re-established full control over the territory, and we are able to report that there are no Chechen fighters, terrorist suspects or mercenaries in the gorge. Forty-one persons have been detained, and 2 boeviks were killed during the operation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">We fulfilled our commitment. As the President of Georgia stated, the Pankisi problem no longer exists. We have already invited international monitors to verify the situation and we are ready to receive representatives and groups from any interested State, international body or organization to ensure maximum transparency with regard to the situation there. The first step in that direction has been taken: members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Parliamentary Assembly recently visited the Pankisi Gorge and verified that it has been cleared of armed personnel and that the Government has full control of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">We are still being accused of being in breach of our obligations. Allegedly, we released Chechen <i>boeviks</i> who were later engaged by Russian forces 150 kilometres from the Pankisi Gorge, deep within Russian territory. The blame placed on Georgia for those events is ill-founded. As everyone is aware, the Georgians alone are unable to guard the Georgian-Russian border. Thus, it would have been reasonable to ask Russia's border guards and military personnel how it happened that the armed group moved unhindered through Russian territory towards Chechnya and were intercepted only at the last moment. Georgia's Pankisi Gorge is a strip of territory populated by peaceful civilians. We would never allow the use of excessive force in Pankisi, as happened in Chechnya; that would mean the spillover of the conflict into Georgia. That is why it took time. But I must reiterate that there are no armed personnel in the Gorge.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Let me be clear: Chechens are Russian citizens, and the conflict in Chechnya is Russia's internal affair. Indeed, President Shevardnadze was the first to support Russia's territorial integrity. In 1999, the deliberate push of Chechen fighters into Georgia was regarded as a Russian military success. Now that those Russian citizens have returned to their country, we are blamed for violating international norms. Where is the logic in that? What has changed since then? Should terrorism be defined differently on every occasion according to Russia's liking? Does that define Russia's modus operandi as a member of the global anti-terrorism coalition?</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">I must cite one more example of such extraordinary logic: the case of one of the most notorious international terrorists, Igor Giorgadze -- wanted for several assassination attempts against President Shevardnadze -- which could serve as a litmus test with regard to Russia's commitments. Igor Giorgadze has been taking refuge in Russia for seven years. Numerous requests by both Georgia and Interpol for his extradition have been turned down on the grounds that the Russian law enforcement agencies were unable to establish his whereabouts. The appeal made in 1999 by the United States Congress to the Russian Federation authorities to extradite the terrorist to Georgia was also in vain. Meanwhile, Giorgadze is frequently seen in the company of members of the Russian intelligence and security services and of high-ranking military officers, and he has even become a semi-permanent feature in the Russian media. Giorgadze has been allowed to brazenly use Russian television and print media outlets to actually call for the overthrow of the democratically elected Georgian Government. This repeated use of the Russian media by a wanted international criminal and terrorist is unprecedented in the post-Soviet world. Only two days ago, he was again featured on Russian State television. To what extent can one tolerate double standards on the part of a country that is a permanent member of the Security Council and whose rich history and culture deserve only admiration?</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa13">Here, I must draw the Council's attention to the most painful issue of Georgian-Russian relations: the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia. It is well known that Abkhazia achieved de facto independence only by virtue of the massive involvement and assistance provided by the Russian military and special services. What is the situation here? All the members of the group of Friends of the Secretary-General on Georgia are aware that the paper on the distribution of constitutional competencies between Tbilisi and Sokhumi -- which the group studied for the past two years and only recently agreed upon -- has still not been presented to the parties. In fact, the paper has again been delayed and will not be presented at tomorrow's meeting of the Group with the representatives of the Abkhaz separatist leadership. We cannot fail to express our disappointment in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa14">With regard to the Kodory valley part of Abkhazia, we can state with full authority that Georgia has shouldered all its responsibilities. Moreover, we call for full transparency in the valley, and we invite all interested parties -- both international organizations and others -- to visit the valley for the purpose of verification. Here, I must emphasize that the most dangerous developments are taking place right now in the valley area, where, according to our confirmed reports, the Abkhaz military, together with Russian mercenaries, are concentrating in preparation for an attack against the Georgian-controlled territory. The recent failure of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia to conduct patrols in the valley, which was the result of obstruction by the Russian peacekeeping forces and by the Abkhaz side, only confirms our worst fear that any minute now -- and I do not exaggerate -- those forces may unleash a provocation that could lead to the resumption of hostilities.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa15">I wish I could stop here. But I must voice our concern at the fact that almost 80 per cent of the population of separatist Abkhazia has been granted Russian Federation citizenship. That development has finally brought about a unique situation in which Russia has multiple capacities: facilitator of the peace process and sole peacekeeper in the separatist region, the overwhelming majority of whose population consists of Russian citizens. On whose side is the conflict, then? Surely, it is no longer on the Abkhaz side.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa16">The Abkhazia and Tskhinvali -- the former South Ossetia -- regions of Georgia have degenerated into areas of lawlessness where grave violations of human rights and acts of terrorism have become the normal pattern of life. The Abkhaz separatist regime has tarnished itself by carrying out the ethnic cleansing of the predominantly Georgian population, expelling 300,000 people from their places of permanent residence. The data that we possess clearly indicate that the situation in those regions has created a breeding ground for terrorism, drug trafficking and illicit arms smuggling.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa17">Yet we cherish the hope that goodwill will prevail. We are proud of the heritage of friendly relations between the Georgian and the Russian peoples. We still strive towards a friendship with the great Russian people that is rooted in equality and mutual respect, not in intimidation and continuous deceit. Therefore, we appeal to the Russian authorities to desist from carrying out terrorism against a friendly neighbouring State, against its people and against its President. Any military action against my country will have catastrophic repercussions on the entire Caucasus region. We appeal to the Security Council not to allow that to happen.</p>

	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Georgia for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Yugoslavia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sahovi</span> <span class="nation">Yugoslavia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">At the outset, allow me, Sir, to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council and to express our appreciation to you for convening this meeting, which provides an opportunity for a broader debate on an issue that is of concern to us all.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">The Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), at the beginning of today's debate, eloquently expressed their concern and indicated the course to be followed in our future counter-terrorism efforts. We thank them for that.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">The Security Council gave substance to its resolve to combat international terrorism by adopting a landmark resolution -- <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> -- which has become the basis for the broadest possible international coalition against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">The Counter-Terrorism Committee -- unique in the breadth of its mandate -- has become the focal point for counter-terrorism action within the United Nations. It provides an effective mechanism for implementing the resolution and for enabling continuity of international action in this field, particularly on the basis of inter-State cooperation. Yugoslavia fully supports the work of the CTC. We would also like to express our appreciation for the outstanding, energetic and committed leadership of CTC Chairman Sir Jeremy Greenstock.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">The achievements of the Security Council in countering this global threat have once again proved that the United Nations is uniquely positioned to serve as the legitimate forum for an international counter-terrorism coalition, as it can ensure that the greatest possible number of States are able and willing to take the necessary steps to oppose terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">The fight against terrorism cannot be won solely by focusing on mechanisms aimed at eliminating individual terrorist groups, since terrorism is not an isolated phenomenon. Instead, it should be viewed in the context from which terrorist activities arise. In its counter-terrorism efforts, the United Nations must focus on the broader picture. As the Policy Working Group on the United Nations and Terrorism stated in its recent report, it is necessary for the United Nations to reassert the main purposes of the United Nations Charter, the core of which has been threatened by terrorism. We have identified in this report certain important points and recommendations that warrant the attention of the United Nations membership as a basis for further enhancing United Nations engagement in the field of counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> notes "the increase, in various regions of the world, of acts of terrorism motivated by intolerance or extremism". It also calls for the prevention of movement of terrorists or terrorist groups by effective border controls.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">Yugoslavia has been faced with both extremism and illegal border crossings in the province of Kosovo and Metohija. We welcome the enhanced efforts by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to address these problems, and we expect the Mission to continue to improve its measures in these areas. My Government reiterates its readiness, in line with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, to enhance cooperation with UNMIK and KFOR with a view to preventing and suppressing acts of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">Regrettably, organized crime, whose close connection with terrorism has been firmly established, figures high on the list of acute problems affecting South-eastern Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">Yugoslavia is fully committed to adequately addressing this issue. At the national level, Yugoslavia has recently adopted laws on combating organized crime at both the federal level and at the level of the Republic of Serbia, and a new law on the prevention of money laundering took effect in Yugoslavia in July this year. At the international level, we have ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its supplementary protocols, as well as the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime. At the regional level, we are fully committed to dealing with this issue within the South-eastern European Cooperation Process, which Yugoslavia is currently chairing, as well as within the framework of the Stability Pact for South-eastern Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa11">My country is also bound by most international anti-terrorist treaties. We have ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and signed the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection as well as the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. Both are now before Parliament pending ratification. Bilaterally, Yugoslavia has signed treaties with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia related to the struggle against terrorism, organized crime and illegal migration. Yugoslavia is regionally fully engaged in raising awareness of the danger of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa12">We are, of course, also engaged in a dialogue with the CTC. My Government has submitted both the initial and supplementary reports and would like to take advantage of this opportunity to reiterate its readiness for future cooperation. In order to make its full contribution to the fight against terrorism, my country needs, and would greatly appreciate, international assistance.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Stagno</span> <span class="nation">Costa Rica</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">I am pleased to address the Security Council on behalf of the 19 member States of the Rio Group, during consideration of the fourth quarterly report of the Counter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">I should like to begin by thanking Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Committee, for his excellent work at the helm of the Committee and for the presentation this morning of his report.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">A year after the regrettable terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Rio Group categorically reiterates its condemnation and rejection of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We the member States of the Group firmly support all cooperation and coordination measures adopted at the international and regional level in order to combat terrorism, on the basis of strict respect for human rights, the rule of law, international humanitarian law and other norms and principles of general international law.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">We the member States of the Rio Group are firmly committed to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Where it has been necessary, and in order fully to comply with the obligations set out in that resolution, our countries have prepared new legislation and have ratified or initiated the process of ratification of those international ant-terrorism conventions that had not been ratified earlier.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">The Counter-Terrorism Committee has the fundamental task of establishing a constructive dialogue with all States Members of the United Nations in order to ensure that all nations have adopted effective measures to prevent, eradicate and punish terrorist acts. The success of the Committee depends on its capacity to generate ongoing communication between this Organization and its Member States in order to strengthen intergovernmental and inter-institutional cooperation and assistance in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">We the member States of the Rio Group appreciate the opportunity for a constructive dialogue provided by the submission and consideration of national reports. We recognize the value of the Committee's recommendations, while noting, as indicated by Ambassador Greenstock himself, that this body does not exercise judicial functions or seek to judge the conduct of States.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">The Rio Group notes with satisfaction the submission of more than 261 national reports, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We appreciate the excellent work done by the Committee, which has enabled it to consider, with professionalism and transparency, the majority of these reports. We note in particular the progress achieved in the second round of exchanges.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">We have noted that a small group of States has not yet submitted initial reports. While we recognize that some of those States have structural problems which might have made it difficult to prepare their respective reports, we deem it essential that they submit those reports as soon as possible. Therefore we urge them to contact the Committee's experts, who are prepared to help them overcome any practical difficulties they are facing.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">We welcome the presentation of the Committee's programme of work for the fifth 90-day period in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-1075.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/1075</a>. We welcome the Committee's intention to finalize its consideration of the second round of letters before 31 December this year as well as to compile a list of actions undertaken by various international, regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">We are pleased at the Committee's determination to strengthen its contacts and cooperation with regional and subregional organizations in order to create positive synergy among the various multilateral efforts aimed at countering terrorism. In this context, we would mention the adoption, at the thirty-second General Assembly of the Organization of American States, of the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism and of a resolution on human rights and terrorism -- <i>(1906 (XXXII-0/02))</i>, dated 3 June 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa11">We have noted, however, that regional organizations can only act within the respective legislative mandates and in accordance with their constitutions. In this framework, cooperation between these organizations and the Committee should be carried out with strict compliance for these mandates. It is essential for these States which make up the various regional and subregional entities to consider the role which each of them can play in combating this crime.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa12">We have observed the intention of the Counter-Terrorism Committee to remain in constant contact with the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This Committee must always be aware of the interrelationship between combating terrorism and the full observance of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa13">We the member States of the Rio Group are aware that combating terrorism means attacking structural conditions which promote terrorism. With this in mind, we feel it necessary to achieve the goals enshrined in the Millennium Declaration, substantially reducing levels of poverty and improving conditions for health, housing, education and democracy throughout the world.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa14">Moreover, the Rio Group is pleased with the increase in international cooperation to combat terrorism. In this context, we have noted with satisfaction renewed bilateral assistance as well as technical assistance, and financial cooperation undertaken through the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa15">In addition, we must reiterate our concern at the financial situation of the Committee. We feel it essential to apportion sufficient resources to the Committee so that it can effectively carry out its work.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa16">The members of the Rio Group are aware that combating terrorism must lead us to build more open and tolerant societies. Combating this scourge must promote the creation of a true culture of peace, tolerance and solidarity. The members of the Rio Group are firmly committed to this objective.</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Costa Rica for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Egypt. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aboul Gheit</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">There is no doubt that nowadays there is a consensus on the importance of collective international effort to combat terrorism, suppress terrorist acts, arrest those who commit them, and block their funding resources.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">The tragic events of 11 September have focused the world's attention on the fact that there is no alternative to global international cooperation to combat this phenomenon, which knows no boundaries and belongs to no religion or culture. Those who perpetrate these terrorist acts belong to all religions and cultures, as do their victims.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">Egypt is among those countries that have suffered from terrorism, having been the victim of different terrorist acts. This led it to adopt early on legal and security measures in order to confront this phenomenon. Experience demonstrated to us that the fight against it cannot be confined to a security or a political approach. In addition to the security and political aspects, we must include economic, social and legal ones, as well as questions of human rights, in order to achieve concrete results when faced with this criminal action.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">Such an approach requires us to deal with international terrorism comprehensively, in a way that takes into account its many manifestations, different causes, and the means to combat it under its different guises.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">In this context, we must not confuse terrorism -- which we refuse, condemn and combat -- with the legitimate right to self-defence against foreign occupation. This is a legitimate defence that is in agreement with the principles of resisting aggression, occupation, the usurping of rights, and the obliteration of identity. Exercising this right was illustrated by popular resistance in Europe and in the United States in order to end foreign occupation. It was also exercised by people in Latin America, Asia and Africa, in order to gain independence. It is a right confirmed by international law and the United Nations Charter, and by the resolutions and declarations promulgated by this international Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">During the past year, the United Nations has shown that it is an effective instrument for coordinating international efforts to combat terrorism. On that basis, Egypt resolved to be among the first countries to respond favourably to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In fact, Egypt presented two complete reports to the newly formed Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), pursuant to that resolution, describing the measures and actions taken by the Government of Egypt to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">Furthermore, within the same context, the Egyptian parliament last June enacted a new statute to combat money laundering. That ensures the integration of the national measures to fight terrorism with international criteria in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">The war against international terrorism and its manifestations must be waged forcefully. It is crucial, however, when waging this war, that we be vigilant to certain factors that cannot be neglected. Among these is the fact that this war requires the involvement of the entire international community, and not of a few nations. In the context of these efforts, we should not fall into any trap that international terrorism prepares for us, namely, the appearance of disagreements or tensions among different members of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">This war should rather be waged by a broad-based international coalition, in accordance with agreed-upon international laws and with Security Council resolutions and other international conventions.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">We are convinced that what we have mentioned previously is an extremely important point, one about which we must be careful, given the dangers and nefarious effects that this may have on our common efforts. This point relates to kindling tensions between the different entities of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa11">Egypt is convinced that this international Organization, as an effective instrument that represents international will and legality, can play a pioneering role in the fight against terrorism. We therefore expect the United Nations to pursue its role and fulfil its responsibilities in that regard. Egypt will honour its obligations by supporting the efforts of the Organization and by cooperating with it to collectively succeed in combating terrorism and ending its evils.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa12">In conclusion, we would like to recognize the efforts of the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Sir Jeremy Greenstock. We appreciate his hard work, patience, determination and complete credibility in seeking to implement the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> without any problems or tensions. It is thanks to his efforts that we have been able to get to where we are today in our international efforts. We thank him for his efforts.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Egypt for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of India. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nambiar</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">We extend our warmest congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month. We wish you success in dealing with the complicated issues engaging the attention of this body. We would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Bulgaria on the work achieved during the month of its presidency, coinciding as it did with the anniversary of the attacks of 11 September and the general debate in the General Assembly. I also take this opportunity to congratulate Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain on their election by the General Assembly to the Council beginning next year.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">We commend your initiative, Mr. President, to convene this open meeting of the Council on the subject of counter-terrorism, which is the overriding concern of the international community today. One year after the catastrophe of 11 September, such a meeting is opportune to review the progress achieved in our common endeavour to extirpate this phenomenon from our midst and to assess what more needs to be done in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">For some decades, global terrorism has fixed its malign attention upon many countries across the world, bringing in its wake the pain and waste of human tragedy through wanton murders, mindless mayhem and indiscriminate destruction. In recent years this phenomenon has become more pervasive, organized and networked, arising as it has from the debris of the polarizations, divisions and conflicts that characterized the cold war era.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">The response of the international community to this challenge had, until recently, been generally episodic, sometimes apathetic, and characterized often by tokenism. Perhaps this was due to a sense of immunity felt by some societies from the worst manifestations of this phenomenon. Without their conscious engagement, political will and determination, no struggle against terrorism could become a global reality. States that were victims of terrorism, which had hitherto faced this challenge on their own, now find support and sympathy. Indeed, they have now been asked to join the coalition to combat this global evil.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">We in India believe that terrorism is a common enemy of all peoples, of all beliefs and of all religions. It is a disorder that seeks to undermine the peaceful, democratic and cooperative order that most civil societies aspire to attain. The act of terror is intended to cause physical, psychological, social and political damage on a scale that is meant to destabilize communities and to disrupt and retard peace, economic progress and development, social harmony and political institution-building. We know from experience that open, liberal and democratic societies are particularly vulnerable.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">India has been a victim of State-sponsored, cross-border terrorism for two decades now, with a horrendous toll of tens of thousands of persons killed. The recent terrorist attack in a place of worship in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, left over 30 innocent men, women and children dead and hundreds of others wounded. The determination of the people of the state of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise their electoral right to choose their representatives has been marred by a campaign of intimidation and terror inspired from across the border. That campaign has been designed specifically to foster a climate of fear and instability. But, as is abundantly clear in all democratic societies and as has been expressly confirmed in this case as well, the preferred option invariably is that of the ballot over the bullet. Our commitment to the preservation of the rule of law also remains undiminished.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">The international community has responded to the collective challenge created by terrorism and its backers through resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The global war against terrorism has so far been successfully conducted against Al Qaeda and has resulted in the removal of the regressive and obscurantist Taliban regime in Afghanistan. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> has sent a clear and unambiguous message that the world community will no longer tolerate terrorists or their sponsors; that the international community is determined to hold the perpetrators and instigators of terror to account; and that the civilized world will no longer permit such acts to be conducted with impunity. India unreservedly supports <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">The anguish and suffering caused by terrorism is well known to us. We have fought this terror and will continue to do so with unflinching determination and resolve. We have also gained valuable lessons from this tragic period. It is against that background that we would like to share with the Security Council some suggestions that we hope will be beneficial to the implementation of the counter-terrorism resolution and a more effective response from the Council and the Committee to this grave threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) has worked with unceasing effort to coordinate an international approach to tackling international terrorism. We commend Ambassador Greenstock and his colleagues on the Committee, as well as the experts who have helped in furthering the Committee's work, for their untiring labour and productive results. We appreciate the fact that the Chairman of the Committee has held regular briefing sessions for Member States on the progress made by the Committee in implementing the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">Member States have responded promptly to the resolution, judging by the fact that over 170 national reports have been received by the CTC in the first round of reporting, while 83 countries have submitted a second round of reports. This reflects the importance the membership attaches to the work of the Committee and the support it enjoys across the board. I would like to reiterate here that India is fully committed to implementing its obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We have submitted two reports so far.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">The CTC has been doing commendable work in persuading Member States to take legislative and other measures that comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. But there is a long way to go before we can say we have been able to make <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> really effective and operational. It is not beyond the knowledge of the Council that even when Member States have ratified other anti-terrorism conventions there has been more than one instance of blatant non-compliance. Neither the United Nations nor the Member States affected has been able to do much about it. Therefore, enforceability of violations assumes significance.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">I would like draw the particular attention of the Council to sub-paragraphs 2(b), (d) and (e) and 3(a) of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. They deal with what I would call cross-border or transnational terrorism. These sub-paragraphs mandate Members to take actions to prevent the financial planning and facilitation of terrorism against other States. Sub-paragraph 2(e) calls upon States to bring perpetrators of such offences to justice. Member States may say they have complied with these provisions in letter, but how is the CTC or Security Council going to account for the complaint of a Member State which is a victim of such cross-border terrorist acts? What is the action that can be taken against errant Member States?</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">There is a growing momentum towards ratification of all twelve sectoral conventions on terrorism. Countries have also either strengthened existing legislation to tackle terrorism and strengthened institutions, procedures and mechanisms to combat the financing of terrorism, or, where these are absent, have begun them. These achievements should not be underestimated. The approach adopted so far by the CTC to elicit information and then to probe countries in a manner which encourages them to consider the deficiencies in their legal system has served a useful purpose.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa14">However, some work still remains. There are countries which have not submitted any report, because of lack of capacity or other reasons. An approach by the CTC to provide technical assistance, where required, may be useful in such a context. There have also been references to a possible regional approach. This may not be relevant in regions where terrorism emanates from within the region.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa15">I have earlier reiterated that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> marks a watershed in our common combat against terrorism. In our view, it is a timely and ambitious undertaking of the Security Council in fulfilment of its responsibility to maintain international peace and security. The Council must act swiftly and resolutely to implement the counter-terrorism resolution with neither fear nor favour. I compliment the Council on the purposeful start it has made and would like to assure you that the Council and its Committee will have my delegation's full support in the fulfilment of their mandate.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">The last speaker on my list this evening is the Permanent Observer of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lamani</span> <span class="non-nation">Organization of the Islamic Conference</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I would like to express our sincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, and through you to your country, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. We are confident that the work of the Council will be successfully steered under your wise leadership. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his statement this morning, and Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for his eloquent explanation of the important achievements of the Committee he chairs.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">Today, we believe that the convening of this open meeting of the Council is a further step within the framework of the tireless international efforts being undertaken by the Council in combating the scourge of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has constantly condemned terrorism on the basis of the noble ethical and humanitarian principles that are adhered to by its member States, and which stem from its religious and cultural heritage, proscribing all forms of injustice, aggression and intolerance, as well as the organization's adherence to international consensus and agreement on combating terrorism in all its forms and eliminating its causes.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">Based upon this -- and after the Eighth Islamic Summit Conference held in Tehran in 1997, which reaffirmed Islam's condemnation of terrorism -- the OIC Convention on Combating International Terrorism was drafted and later adopted at the twenty-sixth session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers, held in Burkina Faso in 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">Successive OIC Ministerial Conferences have reiterated their commitment to this Convention, in particular those articles stressing the commitment to refrain from initiating, participating in, financing or instigating support for terrorist action in any form, and to those other articles that require the member States not to use their territories as a basis for masterminding or organizing terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of member States of the OIC held two extraordinary meetings. The first was in Doha on 10 October 2001, in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 terrorist acts, and it stressed that these acts run counter to the tolerant teachings of Islam and called for the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to formulate a plan of action to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">The second meeting was held in Kuala Lumpur in April 2002. The Ministers stressed the urgent need to reach an international consensus on a definition of terrorism. They also decided to establish a 14-member open-ended ministerial-level committee on international terrorism. During the annual coordination meeting in New York, held on 17 September 2002, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the OIC member States finalized the composition of this committee with the following States: Malaysia, Qatar, Iran, the Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Pakistan, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Palestine, Djibouti, Tunisia and Indonesia. The Government of Algeria has gracefully offered to host the first meeting in February 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">Both the Security Council and the General Assembly have adopted a number of important resolutions calling for the elimination of terrorism and for the establishment of serious rules for collective international effort, under the auspices of the United Nations, to take a unified stand against international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">The spread of acts of terrorism all over the world and the expansion of the phenomenon of extremism in all mankind's beliefs confirms that the phenomenon of terrorism is one and is not restricted to one people or ethnic group or religion.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">The international community stands on the pillars of cultural, religious, scholarly and philosophical diversity, and such diversity should not be allowed to adversely affect the unity of this international community. In this regard, perhaps the best example would be a quotation from a statement delivered by French President Mr. Jacques Chirac at UNESCO on 15 October 2001 on the role of cultures and the different courses of their evolution:</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">"To be sure, cultures do not all develop at the same pace. They reach their zenith, then decline; they experience periods of influence and expansion, as well as times of silence and contraction. And yet, they all continue to live in the present in our collective memory. They fashion our identity and our raison d'être. They bring light and pleasure to our existence, the marvels of poetry and the fine arts, they open the door to knowledge and transcendence. They also ponder the dark side of things, questioning mysteries and riddles. Together, in equal shares, they have brought light, progress and ethical rigour to humanity."</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lamani</span> <span class="non-nation">Organization of the Islamic Conference</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa01">It is important to state that when we condemn terrorism, we should, at the same time, also condemn attempts to abolish the distinction between terrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial domination or foreign occupation.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa02">The determination of our member States in their call for the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to define terrorism and to differentiate between it and the right of peoples to resist occupation, and to take all necessary measures to completely eliminate international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, stems from the fact that they suffered during the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century from foreign occupation and achieved their independence and freedom after long and bitter struggles for which they paid a high price. Many areas of our world are still suffering from the consequences of the preceding colonial era with regard to the demarcation of their boundaries. Therefore, we do not want any legitimate struggle to end occupation to be labelled as terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa03">In conclusion, it is imperative for all of us as members of the international community to continue our efforts against terrorism. We must refrain from applying double standards in dealing with this grave phenomenon. Our endeavours in this direction should be undertaken along with the effort to continue our support for dialogue among civilizations, in order to shoulder our responsibility to stand against the attempts to create distances by feeding the feelings of hatred and abhorrence. We must all support the foundations of coexistence -- respect and cooperation among all peoples -- to achieve peace and development.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I thank the observer of the Organization of the Islamic Conference for his kind words addressed to me. I invite Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, to speak to respond to the questions raised and comments made.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Just a few comments to pick up on the two points that came out of some interesting presentations this afternoon focusing particularly on those issues that are of direct relevance to the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">Several delegations -- I think Yemen was the first this afternoon -- have mentioned the importance of the 12 international conventions against terrorism. That is something that the Counter-Terrorism Committee has repeatedly referred to. It is also becoming increasingly relevant to each Member State with regard to the adoption of the right legislation and ensuring that it meets the standards of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. I am very pleased to notice that some delegations have picked up the importance of that reference, but I think every Member State needs to realize that the 12 anti-terrorist conventions have a very clear and broad relevance to what we are trying to do under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We need to keep on reminding people and get the regional and international organizations to take this up with greater momentum, because that is the quickest and clearest legislative route to meeting most of the standards of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">I should also like, in passing, to thank again those members of the wider United Nations community that are being particularly proactive in helping their regions or offering assistance and in generating the spirit that we need in cooperation between States. I mentioned one or two in my address this morning, but I would like to thank in particular Australia, which is doing an enormous job in the Asian and Pacific regions, and Algeria, which, in the African Union and in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, has taken a lead in trying to bring people together in regional and wider groups. There are many others. I noticed that Algeria is not speaking in this debate, but it deserves some credit for recent initiatives.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">I notice that one or two statements -- Liechtenstein and the European Union are two that come to mind -- focused on minimum requirements and the weakest link, something that Norway referred to this morning. Again, people should be aware that a weak link breaks the whole chain and this is a global effort. That is why the CTC has focused above all on capacity-building. I am going to come back to it in a second, but recalling the importance of the weakest link as a vulnerability in the counter-terrorist effort and as a huge factor in what we are trying to do in the CTC is very important.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">That is why it is also important that we should be mainstreaming counter-terrorism. I think that during our next period we will look more deeply into the interconnection between counter-terrorism and countering other forms of international organized crime, and, indeed, preserving security in all sorts of ways across the broad spectrum of United Nations business. But getting counter-terrorism into the standard work that we do in security, development and combating crime is very important.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">The last area is one raised by India, which I think is quite important. We are going to come to it in the CTC. It is enforcement and enforceability. I think that Member States are right to raise that. We have not gotten to it yet in the CTC, because we have to start with capacity-building and we have to focus in the early period on creating political momentum; in those two areas we create an objectivity in what we are doing. India, I think, said neither fear nor favour in these matters -- and objectivity, which will make it more possible, if we succeed in those first two areas, to deal with the hard cases. When we have established -- we are half way to it, but we have not done it yet -- that objectivity and the Committee feels able to move on in unanimity to some of the questions of enforcement, then I think that we can consider how we approach failures to meet the necessary standard. But I would also add that enforcement is a matter for the Security Council as a whole, and not for the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We would need to bring those failures to the Security Council, and not try to deal with them ourselves. We have to do the analysis and the groundwork on particular cases. I hope that before I finish my job as Chairman of the Committee, we will begin to focus on those areas that really need attention.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">I look forward to further interventions when you recall this debate, Mr. President, and I am grateful to you for presiding today over a very interesting set of exchanges.</p>
