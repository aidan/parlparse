<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Côte d'Ivoire in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk07">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council reiterates its grave concern at the events which occurred in Côte d'Ivoire at the end of March and at the current impasse in the peace process defined in the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council recalls that it endorsed the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, which is the only solution to the crisis in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms the individual responsibility of each of the Ivorian actors to ensure the full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. It reiterates its complete readiness to take any necessary further steps, against individuals who block the full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council takes note of the report of the commission of inquiry of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the events that occurred in Abidjan on 25-26 March with deep concern. It expresses its appreciation for the work by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council strongly condemns the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in Côte d'Ivoire, including those that occurred in Abidjan on 25-26 March, and expresses its determination to ensure that those responsible for all these violations are identified and that the Ivorian Government brings them to justice. The Security Council expects President Laurent Gbagbo to comply fully with the commitment he has made in this regard through the letter sent by the Permanent Representative of Côte d'Ivoire to the Security Council on 20 May 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council requests, therefore, the Secretary-General to establish, as soon as possible, the international commission of inquiry, as recommended by the commission of inquiry of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and requested by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire, in order to investigate all human rights violations committed in Côte d'Ivoire since 19 September 2002, and determine responsibility. The Security Council calls upon all the Ivorian parties to cooperate fully with this international commission of inquiry.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates its demand for the Government of Côte d'Ivoire to bring to justice those responsible for these violations of human rights. In this regard, it expresses its complete readiness to encourage possible international assistance to the Ivorian judicial authorities to this end and requests the Secretary-General to submit recommendations on the various possible options for such an assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council is deeply concerned by slogans and declarations of hate, in particular those addressed against the personnel of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI), and urges all the Ivorian actors to refrain from any action or statement, especially in the media, which put at risk the security of United Nations personnel and, more globally, the process of national reconciliation. The Security Council recalls the obligation of all Ivorian actors, in particular the Government of Côte d'Ivoire, to cooperate fully in the deployment and operations of UNOCI, which is there at the request of the Government, in particular by guaranteeing the safety, security and free movement of all United Nations personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council requests UNOCI to establish without delay its broadcasting capacity, as mandated in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1528(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1528 (2004)</a> of 27 February 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council recalls that it decided, on the basis of the commitment of all Ivorian political forces to implement fully and without conditions the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, to deploy UNOCI to support the process of peaceful settlement of the crisis, which is to lead to the organization in 2005 of open, free and transparent elections.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council underlines that no concrete progress can be made in the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement until the Government of National Reconciliation composed on 13 March 2003 and completed on 12 September 2003 meets again under the authority of the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council is therefore deeply concerned by the recent announcement by President Gbagbo that he would dismiss opposition ministers. The Security Council also reiterates its concerns at the continuing non-participation of the opposition parties in the Government of National Reconciliation. The Security Council considers that such decisions undermine the normal functioning of Ivorian institutions and resumption of dialogue between Ivorian parties which is the basis of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">"The Security Council underscores the importance of having all relevant Ivorian parties participate fully in the Government of National Reconciliation. In this regard, the Security Council calls on all Ivorian parties to apply faithfully all the provisions of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, including those regarding the composition and the functioning of the Government of National Reconciliation, and to immediately resume political dialogue, with a view to ensuring the effective functioning of the Government of National Reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">"The Security Council reiterates its full support to the Prime Minister, Seydou Diarra, Head of the Government of National Reconciliation, and encourages him to carry on his task until the completion of the peace process, as foreseen in the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">"The Security Council recalls the importance it attaches to the early and full adoption of the constitutional and legislative reforms provided for in the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">"The Security Council takes note in this regard of the renewed commitment of President Laurent Gbagbo, in his message to the nation on 18 May, to fully apply the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and his request addressed to the Parliament to accelerate the achievement of the legislative reforms. It is now expecting these commitments to be fulfilled in order that concrete steps can be undertaken to restore confidence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa19">"The Security Council also reaffirms the urgency of disbanding militias and armed groups and proceeding with operations to regroup the opposing forces in order to permit the start of disarmament and demobilization, which must precede their reintegration into the regular army or civilian life.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa20">"The Security Council firmly rejects the assertion that disarmament can be delayed until after the 2005 elections and calls on all parties to move immediately to begin this process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa21">"The Security Council underlines the responsibilities of the Monitoring Committee as the guarantor of the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and expresses its appreciation for further efforts it may undertake in order to overcome the current impasse in the peace process as well as in supporting UNOCI to carry out its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa22">"The Security Council calls on all parties to take immediate action to implement the steps above and emphasizes that these measures are essential to enable Côte d'Ivoire and Ivorians to return to the path to peace, stability and economic development."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa23">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-17.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/17</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa24">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
