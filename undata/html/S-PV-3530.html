	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council is deeply concerned about the failure of the Bosnian parties to agree to an extension of the agreements on a cease-fire and a complete cessation of hostilities in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the recent deterioration of the situation there. It stresses once again the unacceptability of all attempts to resolve the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by military means.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council calls upon the Bosnian parties to agree without further delay to a further cease-fire and a complete cessation of hostilities and, in this regard, fully supports the negotiating efforts of UNPROFOR and other international efforts aimed at persuading the Bosnian parties to agree to such a cease-fire and complete cessation of hostilities. The Council urges the Bosnian parties to abstain from any steps which may lead to further escalation of the conflict and reaffirms the need for a political settlement on the basis of the acceptance of the Contact Group plan as a starting point."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-24.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/24</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have also been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council is deeply concerned about the obstruction of the normal operation of Sarajevo airport, including the suspension of the humanitarian relief airlift, caused by Bosnian Serb threats against United Nations aircraft and humanitarian relief flights, and by their attempts to impose restrictions on the use of Sarajevo airport by official missions as foreseen in the 5 June 1992 agreement (<a href="../pdf/S-24075.pdf" class="nolink">S/24075</a>). Such obstruction is in breach of the 5 June 1992 agreement and of the Council's previous resolutions, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-761(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 761 (1992)</a>, and is unacceptable. Obstruction of the humanitarian relief also constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"In that context the Security Council demands that all parties and others concerned comply fully with the 5 June 1992 agreement and create immediately the necessary conditions for unimpeded delivery of humanitarian supplies to Sarajevo and other destinations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It calls upon the Bosnian Serb party to guarantee the safety of all UNPROFOR supervised flights to Sarajevo, including humanitarian relief flights.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to keep it informed of discussions with the Bosnian Serb party on the restoration of the normal functioning of Sarajevo airport so that it might take further action as necessary."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-25.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/25</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
