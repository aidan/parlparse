	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa01"> In accordance with rule 30 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, as amended by Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-509.pdf">resolution 56/509</a> of 8 July 2002, I now invite members of the General Assembly to proceed to the election of the President of the General Assembly for the sixty-first session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa02">May I recall that, in accordance with paragraph 1 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-33-138.pdf">General Assembly resolution 33/138</a> of 19 December 1978, the President of the General Assembly for the sixty-first session should be elected from among the Asian States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa03">In that connection, I was informed by the Chairman of the Group of Asian States for the month of March 2006 that the Group has endorsed Her Excellency Ambassador Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain for the presidency of the General Assembly for the sixty-first session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa04">Taking into account the provisions of paragraph 16 of annex VI to the rules of procedure, and with the support of the Assembly, I therefore declare Her Excellency Ambassador Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain elected by acclamation President of the General Assembly for the sixty-first session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa05">On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to extend my warm congratulations to Her Excellency Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa and to welcome her to the General Assembly and to this splendid Hall today. Her election to the presidency of the General Assembly is a recognition of her impressive record of achievements and, I would add, her warm personality, as well as of the strong commitment of the Kingdom of Bahrain to the principles and purposes of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa06">Let me express my deep appreciation of the presence at today's solemn occasion of the Foreign Minister of Bahrain, His Excellency Shaikh Khalid bin Mohammed Al-Khalifa.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa07">The President-elect, Ambassador Al-Khalifa, brings a long and distinguished legal career, at both the national and the international levels, to the United Nations. She was one of the first two women lawyers to practice law in Bahrain. She has held many senior positions with leading legal organizations of the world, including with the International Bar Association. She is currently the Legal Adviser to the Royal Court in the Kingdom of Bahrain.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa08">Her pioneering role in the legal sphere has been coupled more recently with a prestigious diplomatic assignment. She served successfully as Bahrain's Ambassador to France as well as a permanent representative to UNESCO from 2000 to 2004.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa09">Throughout her professional life, Ambassador Al-Khalifa has been a champion of women's rights in her society and in the court system. Here at the United Nations -- and I am sure all present will agree -- her election is a significant contribution to gender equality within the Organization and in the world. She will become only the third female President of the General Assembly and the first one since the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly, in 1969.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa10">Today's election marks the beginning of a three-month transition period. Just as my predecessor, President Ping, did -- so ably -- I am ready to support my successor in her preparations and ensure a smooth transition between the two presidencies. This goes especially for the ongoing reform processes and the two High-level Meetings, on migration and development and on the least developed countries, which will take place in the General Assembly at the beginning of the sixty-first session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa11">I warmly wish Ambassador Al-Khalifa the best of success in her new position. I welcome the fact that she is present in New York already, in early June, and ask all of you to extend your cooperation to her and to her Office during this important period of transition.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk03-pa12">I now invite Her Excellency Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain, who has just been elected President of the General Assembly for its sixty-first session, to take the floor.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Ms. Al-Khalifa" nation="Bahrain" language="Arabic">
	Ms. Al-Khalifa (Bahrain)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01">I am delighted and honoured to have been elected President of the General Assembly for its sixty-first session. I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to all member States, in particular the Asian Group, for their endorsement of my election and for the trust they have bestowed on me. My election to this high post is an honour for my country, the Kingdom of Bahrain, which has witnessed real and comprehensive political and economic reforms. Though small in size, Bahrain has registered tremendous achievements.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">I will work with you all, in cooperation with you, to continue on the path that my colleagues, the presidents of the General Assembly at its previous sessions, have paved, in particular my colleague His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, President of the General Assembly at the current session. He has made great efforts to advance United Nations reform, and his achievements in the areas of international peace and security and of human rights are indeed noteworthy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa03">I cannot fail to commend the tireless efforts made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, during his tenure, to promote the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to enhance respect for human dignity around the world. I commend the continuous manner in which he is working with Member States to liberate peoples from fear, want and disease, as well as to lay the foundations for the reform of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa04">Allow me to congratulate you all on your efforts during this session, which were crowned by the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the creation of the Human Rights Council, affiliated with the General Assembly, and the strengthening of the Central Emergency Response Fund.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa05">The United Nations today faces challenges in many parts of the world that threaten global security and that require collective efforts to confront and resolve them. It is my hope that, in consultation and in coordination with one another, we will be able to identify any shortcomings and develop a system based on effective multilateralism that can accomplish tangible results and serve our common interests, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa06">Indeed, the United Nations is in need of continuous efforts on the part of us all to revitalize its main organs -- hence reforming the Organization has become imperative if it is to achieve its objectives.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa07">I look forward to working with you in pursuing the universal principles enshrined in the Charter. I will also be guided by the Kingdom of Bahrain's foreign policy, which is based on the rule of law, tolerance and respect for human rights and freedoms. We need to enhance the General Assembly's relationship with the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and other United Nations organs. There is also a need to strengthen the partnership among the United Nations, regional organizations and civil society institutions. I will work with you to ensure that at its sixty-first session, the Assembly continues the process of United Nations reform that began a number of years ago.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa08">I am moved by a deep feeling of pain caused by the tragedies occurring throughout the world at both the human and environmental levels. At the human level, the suffering caused by political disputes, wars, terrorism, poverty and malnutrition motivates me; at the environmental level, pollution, global warming, the depletion of natural resources and the increase in the rate of extinction of living species compel me to try to make a difference.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa09">In that context, I have not forgotten the many instances of women being harshly treated, in some parts of the world -- instances of suppression and human indignities. Those memories indicate that the suffering experienced by women as a result of injustices motivate me to work with you to find appropriate solutions to alleviate their pain and to uphold the principles of the Charter, which emphasizes full respect for all humans without discrimination.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa10">I am further motivated by our need to identify and communicate with one another so as to develop a common understanding. It is inconceivable to me how information technology can have advanced to such an incredible degree and yet we still have such difficulty communicating with one another. Indeed, over the past few years the Internet has made a reality of the notion of the universal library, which a few decades ago was merely a figment of the imagination of the noted Argentinean author Jorge Luis Borges. That attests to the role that advanced information technology can play in bringing human beings closer to one another.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa11">Thus, if we reflect upon all the miseries and tragedies suffered by humanity throughout the twentieth century and to the present day, we realize that they not only harm humanity, but also distort the meaning of creativity, art and beauty, leaving a disastrous imprint on reality and on our lives. In fact, the future of coming generations depends on the way in which we address current problems. We must work to preserve humanitarianism and to ensure that our planet is a safer and more suitable place in which to live. Essentially, we are all human beings who share a common fate, and that is what inspired the founders of our Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa12">Thus it is crucial that we find a comprehensive and practical strategy to combat one of the greatest evils of our time: terrorism. Is it possible to achieve this without addressing the problems of poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and extremism in all its forms? Is it possible to achieve this without examining educational curricula that give rise to terrorist ideologies and to exclusion? It is time that we focus on the importance of education in nurturing future generations and foster curricula that promote openness, critical thinking and creativity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa13">Is this not what we, the peoples of the United Nations, seek to achieve: a clear, pragmatic vision that will put an end to the ongoing violations of human freedoms? We are aware that the majority of the world's people live with hunger, disease, illiteracy, war and internal and international displacement. Yet we should not lose hope, for I believe that great hope arises from great hardships.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa14">In conclusion, I cannot fail to reaffirm my commitment to work with you during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly to attain the objectives set out in the United Nations Charter, within a framework of transparency and full respect for all views and positions.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank Her Excellency Ambassador Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain, President-elect of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, for her important, thoughtful and forward-looking statement stressing the need for us to live in a world of hope rather than in a world of fear. There will be an opportunity to extend congratulations to the President-elect in the Indonesian Lounge after the adjournment of this meeting.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Allow me, on behalf of the Group of African States, to congratulate Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Sheikha Al-Khalifa brings with her a wealth of diplomatic experience. We are confident that under her able leadership and guidance, we will have a fruitful sixty-first session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The African Group is particularly pleased at this election, as it has brought a breath of fresh air to the General Assembly. Sheikha Al-Khalifa becomes only the third woman President of the General Assembly since 1946, and we welcome her election as a demonstration of our collective commitment to gender equality.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa03">The agenda of the sixty-first session will be challenging and exciting as we continue to grapple with the unfinished business of reform. As we begin to see the outcome of that effort and to assess its conformity with the expressed aspirations of the majority of the United Nations membership, we will rely on the new President's leadership. While the task before Sheikha Al-Khalifa will not be easy, let me assure her, through you, Mr. President, that she can count on the support of the African Group in her efforts.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa01">It is an honour to express, on behalf of the Group of Asian States, our heartfelt congratulations to Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, former Ambassador of the Kingdom of Bahrain to France and currently representative of the Kingdom of Bahrain at the International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration in Paris, on her election to the high office of President of the General Assembly for its sixty-first session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa02">Her deep knowledge, impressive experience and wide professional achievements in the fields of law and diplomacy will, without doubt, prove to be of great value and will be an asset in guiding member States through the important and complex issues before them, while maintaining our momentum towards reforming the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa03">It is also significant that we have today elected the third woman President of the General Assembly, a step in the right direction towards bridging the wide gender-equality gap that has characterized the presidency of this body.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa04">I would like to assure the President-elect that the Asian Group will render active support and cooperation as she discharges the responsibilities of her high office.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Our group would also like to express its deep appreciation and profound gratitude to the President, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, for his extraordinary commitment and able guidance in fulfilling his duties as President of the Assembly at its sixtieth session. His skill, leadership and dedication have been essential for the achievement of the successful outcome of the session during one of the Assembly's most crucial periods.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa06">As a result of his strong determination and perseverance, fundamental changes have, indeed, taken place under his presidency. The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council are just two of the significant steps that instantly spring to mind. Again, we thank Mr. Eliasson for his outstanding presidency and wish him all the best in his important position as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden. At the same time, we extend our warmest welcome to Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa as the next President of the General Assembly, and look forward to working closely with her.</div>
