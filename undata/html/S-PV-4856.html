	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council, recalling its previous decisions concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular the statement of its President of 12 March 2003 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-2.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/2</a>) and welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 13 October 2003 (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-987.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/987</a>), reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia, and its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of the country, consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its firm support for the Somali national reconciliation process launched under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and led by Kenya. The Council commends the progress made and acknowledges the challenges ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the relevant decisions made by the tenth Summit of IGAD and the first Ministerial Meeting of the IGAD Facilitation Committee on the Somali Peace Process in October 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council urges all Somali leaders to participate constructively in the Leaders Meeting planned by the IGAD Facilitation Committee in Kenya in November 2003 to bridge their differences and to reach agreements on a viable government and a durable and inclusive solution to the conflict in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council commends the Government of Kenya for its crucial role in facilitating the Somali national reconciliation process, and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda for joining in the facilitation work, and encourages the Facilitation Committee to work concertedly towards a successful conclusion of the process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council also commends the support given by the African Union to the Somali national reconciliation process, including its participation in the process and its commitment to deploy a military observer mission to Somalia once a comprehensive agreement is reached.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council calls on the international community to continue its efforts to support IGAD in its facilitation of the Somali national reconciliation process, and calls on the donor countries to contribute to the process, the Trust Fund for Peace-building in Somalia and the United Nations consolidated inter-agency appeal for Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council expresses serious concern regarding the humanitarian situation in Somalia, and calls on the Somalia leaders to facilitate the delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance and to assure the safety of all international and national aid workers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council welcomes the forthcoming mission of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-751(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 751 (1992)</a> to Somalia and States in the region from 11 to 21 November 2003 as a step towards giving full effect to the arms embargo. The Council calls on relevant States and organizations to cooperate with the above mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council reiterates that a comprehensive peace-building programme with special emphasis on disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration will be important to post-conflict Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council expresses its readiness to assist the Somali parties and support IGAD in implementation of the agreements reached in the Somali national reconciliation process."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-19.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/19</a>.</p>
