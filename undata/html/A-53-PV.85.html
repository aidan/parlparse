	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Australia is deeply concerned about the activities of mercenaries and at the potential for instability brought about by their use. Australia has already taken steps to legislate against mercenaries in its Crimes, Foreign Incursions and Recruitment Act, which prohibits the training, financing and use of mercenaries in Australia.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa02">Given the nature of the problem of mercenaries, Australia also considers that international cooperation is required to address this significant global issue. The Australian Government is therefore taking steps to accede to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, and urges other countries to do likewise. When it enters into force, the Convention will provide an effective legal regime to enhance international cooperation for the prevention of recruitment and use of mercenaries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Australia therefore supports strongly the call, in operative paragraph 4 of the resolution, on all States that have not yet done so to consider taking the necessary action to become parties to the Convention.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa04">However, Australia is unable to support the resolution as a whole, because of the language used in other operative paragraphs, which divert the focus of the resolution from the use of mercenaries to extraneous issues.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa01">In the Third Committee, the United States delegation voted against draft resolution XVI, on the right to development, and did so again here in plenary meeting. We had hoped until the final stages of consultations before the Committee took action that we would be able to negotiate compromises that would have allowed us to join consensus. We believe that the effort failed because the draft resolution was not circulated in time for all of the contentious issues to be worked out. As members know, this draft resolution was the last to be addressed by the Third Committee, and the session was extended several times because of it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa02">While there is much in the resolution that we support, the United States voted against it because of profound disagreement on the following points. We do not agree that international macroeconomic policy-making, globalization and debt relief are proper subjects for consideration in the various United Nations human rights forums. Other United Nations forums exist with responsibility for these issues.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa03">We believe it is wrong, and dangerously misleading, to pin the blame for long-standing problems of food, health, education and unemployment on the current international financial difficulties. These problems existed long before the global financial crisis and will continue long after the crisis has passed, unless we confront them squarely, understand their fundamental roots and deal with them through the fundamental structural measures that we all know are required.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa04">We do not support a convention on the right to development. There are many United Nations agencies devoted to development activities, and we believe that promotion of development appropriately belongs with them. By the same token, we do not support adding to the mandate of the High Commissioner for Human Rights burdensome new mandates in the field of development, which are already being pursued by the appropriate United Nations development agencies. Apart from being wasteful and duplicative, this will divert scarce resources from human rights activities for which the High Commissioner has an exclusive mandate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa05">We also regret that the resolution fails to note an essential point agreed upon at the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights: that the lack of development cannot be invoked to justify an abridgement of internationally recognized human rights.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa06">Five years after the first consensus statement in Vienna on this subject, and after a consensus resolution at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, we believed developing and developed countries alike would be able to proceed another step towards a more complete understanding of what the right to development means and how to work together towards its realization. We are disappointed that consensus was broken. We hope that all delegations will take time to reflect on how we can retain the spirit of cooperation that prevails on development issues when we return to the Commission on Human Rights next March in Geneva.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk06-pa02">The democratic process that began in my country after unification in 1990 has consecrated human rights in Yemen, constitutionally, legally and in practice. This process has also been conducive to a widespread climate of political freedom and freedom of the press -- there are more than 100 newspapers and party bulletins and over 17 political parties and organizations in the country. This democratic process has been promoted by parliamentary elections that were declared fair and free by hundreds of international observers.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk06-pa03">Yemen therefore wishes to stress its commitment to human rights conventions and instruments. At the same time, it denounces all violations of human rights whenever and wherever they occur. However, the Arab Republic of Yemen has noticed that the issue of human rights has been treated in a politicized and selective way. This has compelled my delegation to abstain in the voting on all draft resolutions on human rights, with the exception of those adopted by consensus. Accordingly, we abstained in the voting in the Third Committee on the draft resolutions contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-625-Add.3.pdf">A/53/625/Add.3</a> for the following reasons.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk06-pa04">First, we abstained in the voting because of the politicization of human rights issues and their use as political tools to pursue economic, commercial and other interests.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk06-pa05">Secondly, we abstained because of the use of human rights issues as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of States in order to impose hegemony or a state of political dependency on other countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk06-pa06">We abstained, thirdly, because of double standards and criteria, fourthly, because of the selective approach in investigating shortcomings with regards to human rights and, fifthly, because of the disregard for the right of development and the underemphasis on its direct impact on human rights.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa01">My delegation wishes to explain its position on draft resolution X, contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-625-Add.3.pdf">A/53/625/Add.3</a>, entitled "Situation of human rights in Afghanistan".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa02">We fully understand that the human rights situation in various parts of Afghanistan is a cause of international concern. We are confident that this situation will improve once peace returns to that war-ravaged country, and we urge reconciliation within Afghanistan through realistic compromise and mutual accommodation. We also call for international engagement and dialogue with Afghanistan to promote the objectives of humanitarianism, human rights and peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa03">Pakistan fully supports the efforts of the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference for the restoration of durable peace in Afghanistan. We believe, however, that the cessation of all outside interference inside Afghanistan is a prerequisite for the realization of this objective. In order to strengthen its role as an impartial mediator in Afghanistan, the United Nations needs to adopt the vacant-seat formula for the representation of Afghanistan, as has been implemented by the Organization of the Islamic Conference.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa04">Pakistan strongly condemned the killing of the Iranian personnel seized in Mazar-e-Sharif. Those responsible for these outrageous killings must be punished. We are encouraged that during the recent visit of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, the authorities in Kabul agreed to the establishment of commissions of inquiry to investigate the killing of Iranian personnel in Mazar-e-Sharif -- a crime from which they have already dissociated themselves -- as well as other killings.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa05">The United Nations needs urgently to initiate the process for establishing these commissions. Besides the visit of the commissions of inquiry, the return of United Nations workers to Afghanistan and the stationing of United Nations monitors in major cities of Afghanistan would help in preventing the recurrence of such unfortunate incidents in the future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa06">In the Third Committee my delegation expressed its dissatisfaction with the interim report of the Special Rapporteur on Afghanistan. Paragraph 3 of that interim report clearly states that the Special Rapporteur was "unable to travel to Afghanistan and Pakistan" (<i><a href="../pdf/A-53-539.pdf">A/53/539</a>, para.3) </i>due to security considerations. We are unable to understand the reference to Pakistan. I myself, at least, am not aware of any security situation in Pakistan that could have prevented the Special Rapporteur from undertaking a visit to Islamabad.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa07">What is clear, however, is that the Special Rapporteur did not visit Afghanistan. It is obvious, then, that the interim report was written somewhere else. It therefore contains merely allegations and counter-allegations, based on hearsay and bereft of any on-the-spot investigation whatsoever. Despite this serious flaw, the Special Rapporteur has regrettably deemed it appropriate to draw conclusions and to express shock and dismay at the situation in the country. How has he arrived at these conclusions, and on the basis of what evidence and what investigations?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa08">My delegation cannot associate itself with an unsubstantiated report from a Special Rapporteur who failed even to appear before the Committee to explain how he had arrived at his conclusions without any investigation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa09">For these reasons, my delegation disassociated itself from the consideration of the draft resolution on "The question of human rights in Afghanistan" in the Third Committee on 20 November 1998. My delegation wishes to reiterate the same position in the plenary as well.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk07-pa10">I would request that this statement be included in the official proceedings of the General Assembly.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I should like to speak in explanation of vote before the voting on draft resolution IX, entitled "Situation of human rights in Kosovo".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Albania has for a number of years been the main author of the resolution entitled "Situation of human rights in Kosovo". Since 1992, the General Assembly has addressed the situation of human rights in Kosovo with particular concern through its resolutions 47/147, 48/153, 49/204, 50/190, 51/111 and 52/139.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa03">Unfortunately, despite this continuous attention, a second Bosnia tragedy is in the making in Kosovo, which the international community has not been able to prevent. The year 1998 has become the year of the "ethnic cleansing" of the Kosovo Albanians, and the situation there has taken on the dimensions of a real threat to international peace and security, as already defined in Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf">1160 (1998)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1199(1998).pdf">1199 (1998)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1203(1998).pdf">1203 (1998)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Since the beginning of this year, the Serbian military and police forces have been carrying out military attacks against the Albanian population in Kosovo. The consequences of this policy have been appalling. First, wanton and summary executions have caused the death of thousands of innocent people, who were massacred, mutilated and beheaded. Among them were pregnant women, children, and elderly and sick people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Secondly, the intentional shelling and burning of Albanian villages has destroyed one-third of the houses and forced more than 300,000 people to flee. Thirdly, a catastrophic humanitarian situation has developed, with people living in the open, without food, shelter or medical assistance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa06">The Albanian delegation would like from the outset to thank the United States of America for taking the lead this year and for its great efforts to reach a broad agreement on this issue. My delegation was actively involved in the whole process of negotiations and was prepared and willing to become a co-sponsor of this draft resolution, given the fact that Albania has been its main author for years, the relevance of this issue, and the situation of 2 million Albanians in Kosovo.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa07">Unfortunately, Albania was not able to co-sponsor the draft resolution this year. Despite our great and constructive efforts, the sponsors of this draft could not accommodate our principled position on a number of issues.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa08">First, the draft resolution took out the reference to the respect of the will of the inhabitants of Kosovo -- operative paragraph 16 -- which has been the core element of the previous resolutions on the human rights situation in Kosovo adopted by the General Assembly. The Albanian delegation is of the opinion that no sustainable solution to the conflict in Kosovo can be found without respecting the will of the Kosovar Albanians.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa09">Secondly, the draft resolution fails to take into consideration the fact that the Kosovar Albanians have for nine years organized a peaceful resistance to the Serbian oppression and State terror. For nine years, the Albanians did not commit a single act of violence despite persecution, torture, deprivation, illegal detention and the negation of all human rights by the Belgrade regime.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa10">In the face of this year's Serbian military and police attack, which threatened their basic right to life, the Kosovar Albanians were obliged to resist through self-defence. The sixth preambular paragraph and operative paragraphs 6 and 9 do not reflect the reality on the ground. If the sixth preambular paragraph and operative paragraphs 6, 9 and 16 were to be put to the vote separately, the Albanian delegation would vote against them.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa11">Given the importance of the issue and the fact that this is the only draft resolution of the General Assembly which addresses the situation of human rights in Kosovo, the Albanian delegation will vote in its favour.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa12">We would kindly ask the Secretariat that this statement be placed on record.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk04-pa02">The Republic of Benin remains committed to the question of democracy and human rights, and we have made it one of the bases of our foreign policy. In fact, since the conference of the nation's active forces in February of 1990, Benin has constantly taken steps to promote a democratic culture and respect for human rights. In this endeavour, we enjoy considerable support from the international community in general and from our development partners in particular. It is in this context that we will be hosting the Fourth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies in the year 2000 in Cotonou.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk04-pa03">According to the resolution on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran, there is a real political will to establish a more tolerant and more peaceful society in that country. The Iranian Government has undertaken to promote respect for the rule of law, to eliminate arbitrary arrests and detentions and to strengthen the legal and prison systems. All these points are welcomed in the resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk04-pa04">Benin's modest experience in this field has shown that the promotion of human rights and democracy is a long-term endeavour that needs to be carried out on the ground and over time. This is why Benin believes that Iran should be supported and encouraged to continue the efforts being made to establish a state of law. It is for this reason that we voted against the resolution.</div>

We believe that Kosovo is a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and respect for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in its internal affairs under any pretext are in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter. For this reason, the Chinese delegation could not support the resolution entitled &quot;Situation of human rights in Kosovo&quot;, which was just adopted. Therefore, we abstained in the voting.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk06-pa01">My delegation wishes to explain its vote on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-164.pdf">resolution 53/164</a>, on the situation of human rights in Kosovo.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk06-pa02">India voted against the resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo, but not because India is indifferent to the plight of the Albanian minority in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On the contrary, as a democracy and country of many languages and faiths, committed to pluralism, India is firmly committed to human rights and to the promotion and protection of the rights of all minorities within the framework of the unity and territorial integrity of Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk06-pa03">Rather, we voted against the resolution because it reflects the inconsistent manner in which human rights violations in the former Yugoslavia have been treated in the Third Committee.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk06-pa04">On the one hand, we have one resolution -- <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-163.pdf">resolution 53/163</a> -- on the situation of human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) -- that is, on three independent, sovereign countries, in one resolution. On the other hand, we have another resolution, piloted in the Third Committee by the same delegation, on a part of one of those three countries as though that part of the country were not an integral part of the country concerned.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk06-pa05">India is also committed to the preservation and protection of the territorial integrity, national sovereignty and independence of Member States of the United Nations. Indeed, Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf">1160 (1998)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1199(1998).pdf">1199 (1998)</a> also reaffirm the commitment of all United Nations Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Given the existence of another resolution on the same country, the resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo seems to convey the presumably unintended signal that we are referring to the situation of human rights in a separate territory. It could therefore be seen as inconsistent with Article 2, paragraph 7, of the United Nations Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk06-pa06">The right place to have addressed the situation of human rights in Kosovo would appear to have been in the context of either the omnibus resolution or a separate resolution on the situation of human rights in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg022-bk06-pa07">For the reasons outlined, we were obliged to vote against the resolution.</div>

We did so because we believe that the resolution highlights the positive developments and general progress on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk04-pa01">I am speaking in reply to the statement made by the Ambassador of Pakistan on the resolution on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk04-pa02">I was truly saddened to hear such an eminent personality as Professor Paik, a dean of the College of Law of Seoul National University in Korea, referred to almost as though he were a dishonest man by the representative of Pakistan, who threw Professor Paik's report into question. People like Mr. Paik are faithful servants of human society and human rights. He visited Afghanistan several times, including in May 1998, and his statements are thus very well founded. For three years, we have repeatedly endorsed his statements on Afghanistan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk04-pa03">The representative of Pakistan tells us that Mr. Paik has not been to Afghanistan in recent months. Obviously, he was unable to enter the country because he was denied permission to do so and clearly could not run the risk of suffering the fate of Lieutenant-Colonel Calo, who was murdered on 21 August by two Pakistanis in Afghanistan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk04-pa04">The Ambassador of Pakistan yet again trotted out the three-year-old litany about a vacant seat for Afghanistan. Of course, he cited the instance of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. The Assembly should be aware, however, that ever since the Conference adopted a resolution on the Afghanistan seat, the Taliban side has systematically denied every demand of the Conference.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg023-bk04-pa05">The representative of Pakistan obviously intends that there should be no Afghani voice in this Assembly, because we denounce Pakistani intervention, particularly military intervention, in Afghanistan's affairs and the presence of 35,000 armed Pakistanis in Afghanistan. That paints the picture clearly. What is also crystal clear is that no country here, no State represented in this great Hall, supports the points made by the representative of Pakistan.</div>
