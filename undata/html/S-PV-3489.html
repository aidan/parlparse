	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">The first speaker is the representative of Liberia, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bull</span> <span class="nation">Liberia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">At the outset, Sir, I would like to congratulate you upon your ascendancy to the presidency of the Security Council for January 1995. The record of your distinguished career shows us that the deliberations of the Council will achieve every measure of success.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I should also like to thank the Ambassador of Rwanda for his stewardship of the Council last month, which yielded positive results.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">My delegation expresses its profound gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his unrelenting concern with and involvement in the Liberian crisis. In particular we appreciate his eighth progress report on the activities of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) and on the current status of peace initiatives being pursued by the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), His Excellency President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, and other ECOWAS leaders, in concert with the Liberian National Transitional Government, faction leaders, and others concerned with the conflict in Liberia -- initiatives aimed at finding an acceptable and durable resolution of the Liberian civil war.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The useful recommendations which have been advanced by the high-level mission led by Mr. Lansana Kouyate, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and which the Secretary-General endorses in his report, capture quite vividly the various dimensions of the Liberian problem. My delegation shares the optimism that if those proposals are translated into action it will not be long before lasting peace is achieved in Liberia and the subregion as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">While it is a source of considerable regret and disappointment to note that talks in Accra among the faction leaders which should have culminated in the establishment of a new Council of State appear to have ended in a stalemate, we are hopeful that this is only a temporary setback.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">We the overwhelming majority of Liberians have publicly declared our desire for peace. It is only in an atmosphere of peace and stability that our national aspirations and ambitions can be achieved. The faction leaders must show courage and flexibility in order to reach political accommodation and begin the process of national reconciliation.We therefore fervently appeal to their sense of brotherhood and patriotism and ask them to empathize with the unnecessary, long suffering of their compatriots.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">While we recognize that it is up to Liberians to end the war and that the international community, particularly States members of the Economic Community of West African States, has expended large resources on peace-keeping and peacemaking in Liberia, their continuing engagement in Liberia is needed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">Even though we welcome the Secretary-General's recommendation for the extension of the mandate of UNOMIL, my delegation would have preferred a longer extension in view of UNOMIL's direct responsibilities in the implementation of the agreed schedule for the cease-fire now in effect and the disarmament and demobilization of the combatants, as well as in the holding of democratic elections on 14 November this year.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">The Secretary-General's report emphasized the urgent need for full compliance with the Council's arms embargo on Liberia. The truth of the matter is that as long as arms are provided to the factions this will continue to result in the use of force.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">We welcome the Secretary-General's request that an ECOWAS summit be convened to address these and other concerns. However, the Security Council must take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with its own embargo, to which I have just referred. In successive reports to the Council, the Secretary-General has requested the contribution of Member States to the Trust Fund for Liberia. As the Fund is used to help provide assistance to the troop-contributing countries, my delegation joins in the Secretary-General's appeal for increased contributions to it. In this connection, we thank those countries which have responded to the appeal and also the troop-contributing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">The grave humanitarian crisis in Liberia, which the Secretary-General highlighted in his report, continues to deserve the international community's sympathy and support. We welcome the Council's appeal for increased humanitarian assistance as set forth in the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">When the Liberian crisis is finally resolved, it will herald a significant milestone in what can be attained through regional peace-keeping buttressed by firm action from the international community through the Security Council. We therefore appeal for the Council's steadfast cooperation and support until peace is achieved in Liberia.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. If I hear no objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Xuexian</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">The Liberian peace process is now at a crucial juncture. We are pleased to note that the parties in Liberia signed the Accra Agreement on 21 December 1994 and thereafter entered into a comprehensive cease-fire. By no means an easy achievement, this has laid a solid foundation for the advancement of the peace process in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The reality in Liberia has once again demonstrated that peace cannot be achieved by military means. Persistent, patient and sincere negotiation and dialogue are the only ways to a political solution acceptable to all the parties to a conflict. What is important in this regard is the political will of the parties to commit themselves to a peaceful settlement. A conflict in a country must, in the final analysis, be settled by its own people. The international community, including the United Nations, can play only a supplementary and promotive role in this respect. We hope and believe that the Liberian parties, acting in their national interests, will strictly implement the provisions and the timetable set forth in the Accra Agreement and abide by the cease-fire agreement so as to create the conditions for the restoration of peace in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">The Chinese delegation would like to thank the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) for their unremitting efforts to promote a political settlement in Liberia. We are also highly appreciative of the contributions made to the Liberian peace process by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and particularly by its current Chairman, His Excellency President Rawlings of Ghana, and by the Military Observer Group. They have set an example for joint efforts by the United Nations and regional organizations in settling conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">The Chinese delegation is deeply concerned at the continued massive flow of arms into Liberia, which could undermine the cease-fire agreement reached by the Liberian parties and hamper the successful implementation of the Accra Agreement. The Chinese delegation hopes that the provisions related to the arms embargo will be strictly observed.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The Chinese delegation has all along supported the peace process in Liberia and the efforts by the international community and the relevant regional organizations to bring lasting peace to that country. It is based on this position that we will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ayewah</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">For over four years now the Liberian people have been at the mercy of factional leaders and parties whose desire for power, as well as the allure of high office, would appear to have blinded them to the need for a negotiated settlement to their political differences. The months immediately preceding December last year marked such a deterioration in the political and security situation in Liberia that the number of military observers of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) had to be drastically reduced, the humanitarian situation worsened, and the area controlled by the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG) effectively became limited to no more than 15 per cent of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">Against that background, my Government and other member States of ECOWAS welcome the recent agreement brokered in Accra by the current Chairman of ECOWAS, which builds upon the Yamoussoukro, Cotonou and Akosombo agreements and includes a timetable for the implementation of a programme leading to a cease-fire and to elections.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Taking into account the chain of broken promises and the bad faith so far exhibited by the parties and factions in Liberia in relation to previous commitments, one would be justified in being pessimistic about, if not outright dismissive of, the possibilities and prospects of this latest agreement. As if to justify this pessimism, we have since learned that the latest attempt in Accra to agree on the composition of a transitional Council for Liberia has aborted. We regret this outcome and hope that the great expectations that were only beginning to gain momentum are not permanently lost.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">However, because the ultimate solution to the Liberian conflict must rest with the Liberians, one cannot but hope that the parties will seize the opportunity of the moment, however sad it might seem to be, in the realization that it is futile to continue along the destructive path of a fratricidal war whose main victims are innocent civilians, particularly women and children.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">The draft resolution before us attests to the continuing interest of the international community in helping the Liberians solve their own problems. My delegation would have favoured an extension of UNOMIL's mandate for a six-month period, to allow sufficient time for the initial and critical stage of the military aspects of the Accra Agreement to commence and be observed before the Secretary-General presented his report to the Council. Because of the three-month duration of the present mandate, such a report by the Secretary-General would, of necessity, be tentative and could give the wrong impression of the prospects for implementing the relevant aspects of the Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">My delegation has always underlined -- and this has also been recently highlighted by the Secretary-General in his "Supplement to an Agenda for Peace" -- that ECOMOG's operation in Liberia presents a classical example of cooperation between a regional organization and the United Nations in peacemaking and peace-keeping. In this connection, the international community has a responsibility to continue to assist the process. Otherwise, the burden on ECOWAS countries, which is already a matter of great concern to most Governments of the subregion, will become even more unbearable for their fragile economies. We look forward with particular interest to the Secretary-General's forthcoming report -- referred to in operative paragraph 5 of the draft resolution before us -- on the assistance needed by ECOWAS member States in order to maintain their troops in ECOMOG.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">A very important element in the current draft resolution relates to the continuing flow of weapons into Liberia in violation of the arms embargo imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-788(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 788 (1992)</a>. This proliferation of weapons not only complicates the prospects for disarmament but also compounds the problems of security and jeopardizes the safety of ECOMOG and UNOMIL personnel in the country. It is important, as the current draft resolution reminds us, that all Member States abide by and comply with the embargo on deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">The Nigerian Government and people continue to expend enormous human and financial resources on the ECOMOG operations aimed at restoring peace to the war-torn country. We are doing so because we are convinced that Liberia and Liberians should not be left to their own devices in their moment of travail. What is more, the crisis in Liberia has implications not only for that country but also for the stability of the entire subregion of West Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa09">We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his continuing interest and involvement in the search for a solution to the crisis in Liberia. We also thank those Member States and organizations that have provided financial, logistic and other forms of support to the peace-keeping operation. We appeal to all Member States for additional support so that Liberians may soon be able to resume normal lives and pursue their economic development and well-being.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fulci</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Italy will vote in favour of the draft resolution. We now view the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) for three months as being of considerable advantage.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">On one hand, three months is long enough to allow verification of whether or not the Liberian factions are complying with the Accra Agreement, signed on 21 December 1994 -- in particular, the provisions relating to the cease-fire and the establishment of the Council of State. Unfortunately, as has been mentioned by other members of the Council, the parties were unable last night to reach agreement on the composition of the Council of State, which has therefore not been installed. Thus, the schedule agreed upon in Accra has been delayed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">On the other hand, the extension is short enough to issue a clear warning, a clear signal, to the parties that the time has come for them to demonstrate -- and to demonstrate by deeds, not by words only -- their willingness to ensure peace in their country. Too many times they have failed to abide by agreements they signed. Too often the factions have resumed fighting, making it impossible for the international relief organizations to deliver much-needed humanitarian assistance, prolonging the suffering of the civilian population and plunging its country into an ever-worsening humanitarian and economic crisis. The parties should therefore, without delay, resume their negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Today's draft resolution also calls for tightening of the application of the arms embargo. In this sense, let a clear message go out to the countries concerned: no peace will be reached until the arms flow across the Liberian borders is interrupted.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">The case of Liberia seems emblematic of the collaboration that there should be between the United Nations and the regional organizations in the area of conflict prevention and the maintenance of peace. Africa's regional organizations recently showed their willingness to play a concrete role in the maintenance of peace and security in their respective geopolitical areas and are equipping themselves with mechanisms for conflict prevention and management and the settlement of disputes.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">Italy, but not only Italy, understands and welcomes the growing aspiration of the African countries to play a more effective role, despite the fact that there are still some inadequacies in the structure that is available to them -- a structure that we hope will soon be reinforced.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">The draft resolution that is before the Council today also acknowledges the crucial role played by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), particularly by the Community's current Chairman, President Rawlings of Ghana, whose diplomatic efforts in the negotiation process that led to the recent developments in Liberia deserve full recognition. We strongly hope that these efforts, including a summit of the ECOWAS States, will continue, thus improving the prospects for a lasting solution to the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">We ask the Ambassador of Liberia, who is sitting at the Security Council table today, to transmit this message of hope and encouragement to his country and his people.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">Let me conclude by reiterating my country's willingness to support the African countries' bid for a more direct role in conflict prevention and management on their continent and to strive for more effective coordination between them and the United Nations. Italy hopes very much that the conflict in Liberia will very soon come to an end and that peace and prosperity will be restored in that country.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Legwaila</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">My delegation is gratified that the Security Council agrees that it is necessary to extend the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia by three months -- although some of us would have preferred a longer extension.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">The report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Liberia is informative. My delegation is pleased with it and would like to thank the Secretary-General and his Special Representative for their tireless efforts in the search for peace in Liberia. We should also like to thank and congratulate States members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) -- particularly its Chairman, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana -- in respect of the current breakthrough in the peace process in Liberia, as envisaged in the Accra Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">The Accra Agreement offers perhaps the brightest ray of hope for the people of Liberia. It has brought about a cease-fire, which took effect on 28 December 1994. It also contains a clear programme of action for the peace process. Granted, Liberia has in the past seen the signing of cease-fire agreements that were never respected. It is our fervent hope, however, that this time the leaders of the parties to the Accra Agreement will not renege on their commitment to a peaceful solution to the Liberian crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">It would be disheartening and disappointing for my delegation if any of the Liberian parties were to dishonour their commitment to yet another cease-fire. Unfortunately, we are already disheartened and disappointed by the suspension of the talks in Accra. But by their own agreement the Liberian parties are obliged fully to implement and honour the Accra Agreement. It is their bounden duty to uphold the cease-fire, ensure the installation of the Council of State and commit themselves to the demobilization, encampment and disarming of their militias. They should see to it that humanitarian assistance reaches its intended target groups by ensuring the security of organizations involved in distributing relief supplies to displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">The crucial role that has been and continues to be played by the countries contributing troops to the ECOWAS Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) cannot be overemphasized. In his report the Secretary-General has highlighted the need for assistance to be given to these Member States. We appeal to the international community to render all the necessary assistance to ECOMOG so that it can continue its work without interruptions caused by financial, logistical and other problems. They are doing a difficult and very important job on behalf of all of us, and they deserve the support of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">By <a href="../pdf/S-RES-788(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 788 (1992)</a>, the Security Council imposed an embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Liberia. The continued proliferation of weapons into Liberia not only violates the provisions of that resolution, but also has a destabilizing effect on both the peace process in Liberia and stability in the subregion at large. It is important that the enforcement of that embargo should continue to be tightened. In addition, my delegation believes that the idea of a summit meeting for ECOWAS member States is a brilliant one which should be brought to fruition in the near future in order to bring about, among other things, the harmonization and consolidation of a subregional approach to the Liberian question at this important juncture in the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">Let me conclude by repeating that durable peace can come to Liberia only if the Liberians themselves are ready -- sincerely and seriously ready -- to work for it.</p>

It hopes that the commitments undertaken by all the Liberian parties will this time be respected. It deeply regrets that the Accra talks on the setting up of the Council of State have failed, and it calls upon the parties to set up without delay this organ that is so essential for the transition.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa02">My delegation voted in favour of this resolution, which extends the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) for three months, to enable the parties to provide concrete proof of their good will and spirit of responsibility. It is once again being made clear that the international community and the United Nations cannot take the place of the Liberians; they alone are responsible for their country's fate. The French Government urges the Liberian factions to respect the cease-fire concluded on 28 December last and calls for strict implementation of the arms embargo. My Government supports the Secretary-General's recommendation for the holding of a summit of the Heads of State of the region to harmonize their policies towards Liberia and promote the implementation of the Accra Agreement. The continuation of the conflict in Liberia is truly a threat to the stability of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa03">The humanitarian situation, which, as the Secretary-General stresses, has left the population in extreme distress, is of deep concern to my country. France is providing humanitarian assistance, particularly within the framework of the European Union. The United Nations and the non-governmental organizations are doing all they can to come to the aid of the civilian population. It is absolutely shocking that material and other supplies intended to assist people are plundered and that the life and freedom of movement of the personnel of these organizations are threatened. My delegation therefore calls upon the parties to respect their commitments and to ensure that the military commanders in the field allow assistance to reach its destination.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa04">At the end of the three-month period, which will serve as a test of the good will of the Liberian factions, my country will be ready to consider possible recommendations by the Secretary-General for augmenting UNOMIL's resources and functions.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir David Hannay</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">My delegation welcomes the signing of the Accra Agreement as a positive step towards the solution of the Liberian conflict. It is right that, in the light of this development and, in particular, the implementation of a cease-fire, the United Nations should maintain its involvement in the peace process in Liberia, and it is for this reason that my delegation was pleased to vote for the resolution just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The successful conclusion of the Accra Agreement is due in very large part to the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and, in particular, its current Chairman, President Rawlings of Ghana, who has shown admirable persistence and commitment in bringing all the factions together to hammer out a solution. We commend his efforts and those of the ECOWAS Military Observer Group (ECOMOG), which has been playing a valuable peace-keeping role in the country. The efforts of ECOWAS, ECOMOG, the United Nations and its Member States represent an enormous commitment on the part of the international community to reaching a settlement to the conflict in Liberia. We urge the Liberian factions now to demonstrate similar commitment and to uphold the cease-fire and implement the other provisions of the Accra Agreement in accordance with the agreed timetable, including the prompt installation of the Council of State.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">One of the very important issues covered in the resolution we have just adopted is that of reminding all Member States of their obligation strictly to abide by, and comply with, the arms embargo. The damaging effect of the brutal conflict in Liberia, not only on the people of that country but also on Liberia's neighbours, is a matter of great concern to my delegation. The conflict is sustained by arms traffic across and within Liberia's borders, which can only increase the risk of regional destabilization. My Government attaches great importance to the effective implementation of this arms embargo by all.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">Finally, let me say that, as the Council adopts this resolution today, my delegation has to admit to the feeling that we have been here before. Throughout the Liberian conflict we have seen a number of agreements signed, each one seeming to offer a way out of the impasse reached. Each time, the Security Council has expressed its support for the peace process and underlined its willingness to work with the factions and with ECOMOG to help bring about a solution to the conflict which is having such a devastating impact on the lives of the people of Liberia. It is our sincere hope that this time the agreement into which the mediators have put such commendable effort will be translated into deeds and that by the time we review the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) again in April we will have seen concrete evidence of the commitment of the Liberian factions to the peace their country desperately needs.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The news we have heard this morning, alas, of the failure of the Accra talks so far to reach a decision on the installation of the Council of State is discouraging indeed, and it hardly augurs well for that review or for the hopes for peace in Liberia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wisnumurti</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">My delegation, at the outset, would like to register its sincere appreciation for the succinct and useful report of the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1995-9.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/9</a> of 6 January 1995, the eighth in the series of progress reports on the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">We also commend and express appreciation to the Secretary-General and his former Special Representative, Mr. Trevor Gordon-Somers, for the untiring efforts to bring about peace in Liberia. We welcome the appointment of Mr. Anthony Nyakyi as the Secretary-General's new Special Representative for Liberia; we hope that he will enjoy success in carrying out his new duties.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">We pay tribute to the members of the high-level mission dispatched to the Member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in order to find ways for reviving the peace process and achieving reconciliation among the Liberian factions. The mission, led by Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Mr. Lansana Kouyaté, carried out extensive consultations throughout West Africa to facilitate a new political accommodation among Liberians, an accommodation which would be possible only if it was supported by a common policy of the neighbouring States directly involved with Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">My delegation is pleased to note that all the Liberian parties succeeded in signing an agreement on 21 December 1994 in Accra. Since this Accra Agreement has been signed by all the factions currently involved in the conflict, we think it appropriate to extend our appreciation to the Chairman of ECOWAS, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, for his success in carrying out the principal negotiations among the parties concerned. His initiatives substantially helped in overcoming the parties' differences; this subsequently led to the signing of the Agreement. In this regard, we also commend the positive role played by the Foreign Ministers of the ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">As pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report, the Liberian parties have signed many peace agreements but have failed to implement them. Hence, we hope that all Liberian parties will now begin to adhere to the Accra Agreement and substantially demonstrate their readiness to implement it fully. We believe that the observance of a cease-fire as of 28 December 1994 could lead to the holding of the free and fair elections which are now scheduled for 14 November 1995, and also to the installation of the elected government on 1 January 1996. We are also in a position to support the Secretary-General's recommendation for the convening of a summit of ECOWAS leaders to coordinate and harmonize their policies on Liberia and promote implementation of the Accra Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">The political future of Liberia depends on the Liberians. Therefore, they must strive to demonstrate further their political will and sustained commitment to peace and stability in their country. This would entail their actively facilitating the safe delivery of international humanitarian assistance throughout the country. In this regard, my delegation calls upon all Liberians to cooperate fully with the activities undertaken by the ECOWAS Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) and the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">Since the peace process in Liberia is now entering a crucial moment, by voting for the resolution the Council has just adopted my delegation has indicated its support for UNOMIL's continued presence in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">The resolution that has just been adopted by the Council extends the mandate of UNOMIL for another three months beginning on 13 January 1995. This reflects the unanimous determination of the international community and the commitment it has undertaken in favour of an early and peaceful solution to the conflict on the basis of the Accra Agreement, including its timetable for implementation of its provisions -- and this process has already dragged on for far too long.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">We hope that the talks on the composition of the Council of State, as referred to in the Accra Agreement, can be resumed immediately and that agreement can be reached as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa10">The extension of the mandate ought to be seen as an opportunity for the parties to the conflict to respect the cease-fire and implement all the relevant agreements. It is our hope that within this period the Liberian parties will be afforded a significant opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to solve their own problems and to respect the role of international, regional and subregional organizations.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Inderfurth</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">The United States is pleased to support extension of the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) for another three months. This follows the agreement of 21 December among the Liberian parties on a cease-fire and a political process for ending their five-year civil war. We commend President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), for his success in facilitating the peace agreement. We also commend Trevor Gordon-Somers, who was then the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General, the Organization of African Unity, the ECOWAS Committee of Nine, and Nigeria, the major contributor to ECOMOG, for their supportive roles in this achievement. It is now up to the Liberian people themselves to demonstrate their commitment to peace by doing all in their power to implement fully the provisions of the peace agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">In this regard, we are concerned by the inability of the Liberian parties to agree on the composition of the new Council of State at the recent meetings in Accra, and urge the parties to overcome the obstacles encountered in their deliberations on this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">UNOMIL, in conjunction with ECOMOG, has a critical role to play. It is already engaged in monitoring the 28 December cease-fire and, providing the cease-fire holds, will soon begin monitoring the disarmament process, supervising demobilization of combatants and reintegrating them into peaceful society, and assisting ECOMOG in overseeing overall implementation of the peace agreement. If implementation of the peace agreement proceeds and the cease-fire is maintained, UNOMIL should be returned to the level authorized by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-866(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 866 (1993)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The United States strongly supports humanitarian efforts to alleviate the suffering of the hundreds of thousands of persons displaced by the conflict. We urge all members of the international community to help further the peace process in Liberia and to support international and regional efforts to aid implementation of the Accra Agreement. The United States hopes that other States Members of the United Nations will contribute generously to the United Nations Trust Fund for Liberia, as the United States has already done, because the Fund is a tangible expression of support for the Liberian people's desire for peace. We hope that peace will return to Liberia in 1995.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">In Russia we are greatly concerned by the complex military, political and humanitarian situation in which Liberia finds itself. We share the assessment and recommendations set out in the Secretary-General's report of 6 January 1995, which in our view adequately reflects the situation in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">The draft resolution that the Council has adopted today provides for the optimum period for which in present conditions the mandate of the United Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) can be extended. It sends all the Liberian sides a clear signal that they must strictly implement all the provisions of the peace agreement relating to the timetable for their implementation. To judge by the latest information from Accra, the sides have not yet fully realized the importance of consistent actions in that specific direction. We therefore call upon them, as a first step and without delay, to set up the Council of State and to resume negotiations to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">In this context, and taking into account the experience of the past few years, we consider appropriate the linkage in the resolution of the establishment of the former level of UNOMIL personnel with the existence, first and foremost, of a stable cease-fire in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Russia has always considered that the active participation of African countries in the achievement of a settlement in Liberia is important in principle for that country's return to the path of peaceful, democratic development. We wish to single out the constructive role of the current Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Mr. Rawlings, President of Ghana. We consider that the countries that are participating in ECOWAS and in the ECOWAS Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) are playing a key role in preventing Liberia from sliding into complete military and political anarchy and in preventing the breakup of the country -- which, without any doubt, would have serious negative consequences for the entire region.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">For that reason we view as most important the provisions in the resolution for strengthening the potential of ECOMOG, including through the help of the international community, and the provisions on convening a summit of the leaders of the ECOWAS States with a view to harmonizing their policies on Liberia and promoting the implementation of the Accra Agreement, through, among other things, tightening the embargo on the supply of arms to Liberia. If this agreement is carried out, then the crisis in Liberia can be overcome, and this, in our opinion, can serve as an example of the successful settlement of a conflict situation on the African continent by forces of the Africans themselves and as an example of the effective interaction of the international community, as represented by the United Nations, and regional peacemaking mechanisms.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Biontino</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Germany views the signing of the Accra Agreement by all the Liberian parties concerned as an encouraging step towards peace in Liberia. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), under the current leadership of President Rawlings of Ghana, has played a most important role in securing this Agreement. We hope that, together with the Akosombo Agreement and the underlying Cotonou Agreement, it will prove to be the basis for a more dynamic peace process in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">We voted in favour of extending the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) for three months. During this extension the Liberian parties will have to prove their commitment to the peace process. In this respect, we are deeply concerned about the failure of the Liberian parties to reach agreement on the composition of the Council of State as stipulated in the Accra Agreement. It is crucial that the cease-fire, the agreed timetable towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict, and the other relevant aspects of the Accra Agreement be respected meticulously. Otherwise the Council will not be able to examine UNOMIL's mandate more thoroughly.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">While it is important to be cautious today, this does not mean that we should hesitate to assist the peace process in Liberia. In this respect, I should like to point out the important role which the Cease-fire Monitoring Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG), together with UNOMIL, is playing in securing such a process. This shows how regional and subregional organizations can assist the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security. We know that the African countries contributing to ECOMOG are shouldering a heavy burden and we think that they should be assisted. I am glad to recall that my Government has offered ECOMOG 35 trucks to help it carry out its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">The Security Council and the international community can assist the peace process. But the various Liberian parties are ultimately responsible for the future of their country. It is up to them to advance the process of national reconciliation and thus to lay the foundations for a lasting peace. We call on them truly to respect the Accra Agreement as well as the Akosombo and Cotonou Agreements, to which they have committed themselves. The international community can assist the Liberians, but only they can achieve true peace.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bakarumutsa</span> <span class="nation">Rwanda</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Since this is the first time that I have personally spoken in the Council, permit me to congratulate you, Sir, on your accession to the presidency of the Security Council for this month. Rwanda is confident that with your experience and competence you will lead the work of the Council successfully. We can assure you of our cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">It is an honour for the delegation of Rwanda to welcome the new members of the Security Council and to assure them of our full and fruitful cooperation this year.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">My delegation wishes to pay a wholehearted tribute to the Secretary-General for his report dated 6 January 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-9.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/9</a>) on the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL). We wish also to extend deep thanks to the current Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the President of Ghana; to all the States members of ECOWAS; to the personnel of the ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG); and to the international community for their invaluable support for the peace process in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">In regard to the Liberian conflict and its disastrous effects on neighbouring countries, the delegation of Rwanda deplores the deterioration of the situation in Liberia caused by the non-compliance with the letter of the Cotonou and Accra agreements signed in 1993 and 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">At this time when the peace process in Liberia is proceeding in fits and starts and therefore dampening the international community's optimism, the delegation of Rwanda believes the Accra Agreement to be an oasis of hope in a desert almost totally devoid of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">My delegation nevertheless deplores a widespread attitude in the Security Council <i>vis-à-vis </i>the resolution of African conflicts. It became clear in 1994 alone that in some cases the withdrawal of troops led to massacres. In the case of another African country, the decision by the United Nations to disengage its forces was not the best solution for the people of that country who were victims of warlords.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">In the case of Liberia, the decision to extend the presence of UNOMIL's peace forces by three months has not been taken for the good of the population but is, instead, a solution based on a strategy of threatening the parties to the conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">Africa is going through a period of crisis and its effects are not felt by just one country. At the same time, Africa is at a stage of advanced marginalization in many spheres as compared to the rest of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">The search for solutions to conflicts like the one in Liberia should not be limited to a three-month period. Only a process, a slow path, can lead to consensus by all parties concerned. This is evidenced by the fact that in other regions of the world the Council has acted differently.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">As a gesture of solidarity and cooperation, my delegation voted in favour of the extension of UNOMIL's mandate until 13 April 1995, but we promise the Council that we will return to this matter at an appropriate moment.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa11">Meanwhile, my delegation encourages and supports all efforts undertaken by the countries of the subregion to assist in speeding up the implementation of the provisions of the various peace agreements in Liberia.</p>
