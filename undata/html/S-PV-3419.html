	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">&quot;The Security Council considered the oral report of its fact-finding mission to Burundi which visited Bujumbura on 13-14 August 1994 and subsequent briefing by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Council takes note of the observations and recommendations contained therein.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the ongoing negotiations in Burundi aimed at reaching an early agreement on presidential succession, overcoming the long-lasting constitutional crisis and establishing stable democratic institutions in the country. The Council urges all parties to these negotiations to display maximum political will for a speedy settlement of existing differences and to make every effort to accomplish this objective by the scheduled date of 26 August 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council follows closely the current negotiations and deplores the attempts of any party to block progress towards political settlement which is essential for stability in the country and for the prevention of outbreaks of violence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council reaffirms its condemnation of those extremist elements who attempt to undermine the national reconciliation. The Council calls upon all the parties in Burundi to reject any undemocratic or extremist solutions in the settlement of their political differences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Security Council considers that impunity from justice is one of the most serious problems which contributes to the deterioration of the security situation in Burundi. For this reason, it attaches importance to the strengthening of the national judicial system. The Security Council also attaches importance to the deployment in Burundi of civilian observers responsible for monitoring the establishment of a more secure environment.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Security Council is alarmed at the extent of the humanitarian crisis in Burundi. It is concerned with recent attacks against foreigners in Burundi, including those involved in humanitarian relief operations and belonging to the diplomatic community. It calls upon the authorities and all parties in Burundi to provide safety and security for all personnel involved in the relief efforts and other international personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Council encourages the Secretary-General to continue to keep under close review ways and means of using available resources to sustain and enhance the international humanitarian efforts in Burundi and to promote national reconciliation there. It likewise encourages the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and Member States of the United Nations to redouble their efforts in this regard, including through political contacts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;The Security Council commends the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in Burundi, as well as the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the High Commissioner for Refugees, for their tireless efforts, within their respective competences, to contribute to the resolution of political, humanitarian and other problems of this country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">&quot;The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-47.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/47</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
