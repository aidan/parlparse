	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">There were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1514(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1514 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council urges all Ivorian political forces to implement fully, without delay or precondition all the provisions of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement as well as those of the agreement reached in Accra on 8 March 2003 ('Accra II') with a view to open, free and transparent elections being held in Côte d'Ivoire in 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction the progress made since the statement by its President on 25 July, in particular the appointment of Ministers of Interior and Defence, the adoption of the amnesty bill by the National Assembly, the reopening of the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, and the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers on 16 October to restore public order and reform the statute of Ivorian radio and television (RTI).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its serious concern, however, that the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement has slowed down. It emphasizes in particular the importance of the entire Government of National Reconciliation meeting as soon as possible in order to implement fully the content of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. It reaffirms in this context the urgency of carrying out the cantonment operations of the forces involved, to allow the beginning of disarmament and demobilization, accompanied by measures for reintegration into the regular army or civilian life.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council further emphasizes the urgent need to begin reforming land law and electoral rules, restore public services and the authority of the State throughout the territory of Côte d'Ivoire, and end the use of mercenaries and the illicit purchase of weapons in violation of national laws.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council condemns firmly the grave human rights violations. It further condemns the murder of a French journalist on 21 October in Abidjan. The Security Council calls for a full investigation by the Ivorian authorities of this crime and punishment of the perpetrators in accordance with the law. It also calls on them to ensure that organs of the press and groups which sponsor them refrain from encouraging any remark that might incite hatred or violence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its concern for the grave humanitarian situation in the field. In this context, the Council supports the activities of all United Nations agencies aimed at assisting the Ivorian people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"The Security Council further condemns the hostile acts against United Nations personnel in Bouaké and Man on 24 and 25 October last, and recalls that all the parties are obliged, by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1479(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1479 (2003)</a>, to cooperate with the special political mission established by the Security Council, the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire (MINUCI), and to ensure freedom of movement of its personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), France and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General with a view to stabilizing the country and seeking a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The Council welcomes in particular the recent initiatives of the Presidents of Ghana and Nigeria and the holding of a regional summit in Accra on 11 November 2003 to address security problems in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">"The Security Council commends the action of the forces of ECOWAS and France, and that of MINUCI, and pays tribute to the commitment and dedication shown by their personnel. It also welcomes the efforts of the United Nations Office for West Africa and of all United Nations missions in the region to coordinate their action in order to address regional issues in an appropriate manner. It expresses its intention to examine the recommendations by the Secretary-General on ways to facilitate peace and stability in Côte d'Ivoire."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-20.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/20</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
