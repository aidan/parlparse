	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa04">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Third Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Third Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified otherwise in advance. This means that where recorded votes and separate votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Third Committee.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Kangaskorpi</span> <span class="nation">Finland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa01">I have the honour, on behalf of the European Union, to explain our position in connection with the two resolutions just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa02">The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated countries Cyprus and Malta, as well as the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country member of the European Economic Area (EEA), Iceland, align themselves with this explanation of vote.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa03">The European Union would like to share our views regarding the arrangements for the participation of non-governmental organizations in the Beijing + 5 special session. The European Union has joined the consensus in adopting the resolutions and can support their content.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa04">While paragraph 16 of draft resolution II and corresponding paragraph 15 of draft resolution I remain valid, further discussion, in light of the new developments concerning non-governmental organization participation in the follow-up processes, is required. Since the adoption of draft resolution II in March of this year, new experience has been gained and new developments have taken place. Agreement was reached regarding the arrangements for accreditation and participation of non-governmental organizations in the ICPD + 5 special session held in June and later, in August, for next year's Copenhagen + 5 special session.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa05">In light of these recent developments, we feel that it is important that women's organizations are treated on an equal basis with non-governmental organizations which are participating in other, similar follow-up processes.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa06">The European Union discussed the issue of participation by non-governmental organizations informally during the negotiation process in the Third Committee but decided not to pursue the issue, as it is a matter to be addressed by the Preparatory Committee. Non-governmental organization participation was discussed during the Beijing + 5 informal consultations a couple of weeks ago, and the European Union also raised the question of accreditation of those non-governmental organizations not covered by the existing arrangements.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa07">Since the Beijing Conference in 1995, new non-governmental organizations have emerged as a result of the momentum created by the Conference itself. These include a number of small national organizations which are unable to participate in the work of the United Nations on a regular basis. For these organizations, the process of applying for the Economic and Social Council consultative status to participate in this particular special session only would not be reasonable and, indeed, would not be meaningful from a practical point of view, especially taking into account the workload faced by the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations. To widen the accreditation for non-governmental organizations other than those having Economic and Social Council consultative status or which participated in the Beijing Conference would provide the interested non-governmental organizations or women's groups with the possibility to attend this particular special session.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa08">Only a short while ago, consensus was reached among delegations on the arrangements for participation by non-governmental organizations in the context of the ICPD + 5 conference and the Copenhagen + 5 preparatory process, including addressing the participation of organizations which did not attend those Conferences or which do not have Economic and Social Council consultative status.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa09">We believe that these arrangements would provide us with a good basis for our discussions. As regards the arrangements concerning the participation of the non-governmental organizations in the plenary, the African Group made a proposal in the informal consultations of the Preparatory Committee which we welcomed. We hope that a final agreement on all the arrangements for participation by non-governmental organizations in the Beijing + 5 special session will be reached before we enter the substantive negotiations in the Preparatory Committee in March 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa10">After all, non-governmental organizations, in particular women's organizations, play a vital role in the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and continue to be an indispensable force for gender equality. Therefore, wide attendance at the special session is essential.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">In connection with the accreditation of non-governmental organizations and their participation in the special session to be held next year for Beijing+5, it is clear to the Algerian delegation -- and we want this to be clearly reflected in the records of the Assembly -- that the accreditation of non-governmental organizations to the General Assembly has already been the subject of discussion and of consensus not only in the Preparatory Committee and the Economic and Social Council, but also in the Third Committee. We feel that the statement made just now by the European Union is an attempt to reopen this question. We hope that this is not the case. In any event, it is clear to the Algerian delegation that the question of accreditation is a matter that has already been discussed and negotiated and on which consensus has been reached. The Algerian delegation does not intend to reopen this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">The participation of these non-governmental organizations in the special session is a question that is now being negotiated. We do not believe that the question should be raised now, at the time of the adoption of the report of the Third Committee. I would ask, therefore, that the statement made by the Algerian delegation be reflected in the records of the Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk08-pa03">For the record, the Government of the United States wishes to note that the applicable international law, which is stated in Article 19 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, is that</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk08-pa05">(a) the reservation is prohibited by the treaty;</p>

The great majority of countries have chosen not to become a party to this instrument, among them the Government of the United States. We cannot support the use of scarce funds by the Secretary-General for a public affairs campaign aimed at promoting a Convention that has gained so little support.</p>

However, my delegation wishes to state that the allocation of funds would be intended to promote the ratification and dissemination of the Convention, which has recently been receiving ratifications, albeit slowly. Moreover, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recently referred to this Convention as a basic international instrument in the area of human rights that certainly deserves the support of the Member States of the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk13-pa02">Thailand deeply regrets that the issue of the right to development has become highly politicized during this session of the General Assembly. The definition of the right to development has become selectively interpreted. Such selective interpretation is contrary to the principles enshrined in the 1986 Declaration on the Right to Development, which clearly stipulates that the right to development encompasses all human rights. Thailand feels that the advancement of the right to development is very much contingent on common understanding of and consensus on the true spirit and real objectives of the Declaration on the Right to Development.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk13-pa03">In this regard, we sincerely hope that in future work on the right to development all parties will make great efforts to achieve such consensus, bearing in mind the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights. Attaching great importance to consensus on the issue of the right to development, Thailand will vote in support this draft resolution, but we reserve our right to express our views in future work and subsequent discussions on the right to development, particularly on the issues reflected in the context of paragraphs to be voted on by the General Assembly.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tapia</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa01">The Chilean delegation wishes to explain its vote on the resolution entitled "Human rights and cultural diversity", contained in <a href="../pdf/A-54-605-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/605/Add.2</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa02">The delegation of Chile joined in the consensus on the adoption of the draft resolution on "Human rights and cultural diversity". Nonetheless, it has reservations as to the appropriateness of including the subject of cultural diversity in the area of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa03">My country scrupulously respects the coexistence of different cultural systems in the international sphere. It could not be otherwise for a country such as Chile, where different cultures of very diverse origin coexist. Nonetheless, we believe that the subject of cultural diversity corresponds to a different area of the work of the United Nations, in particular that of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and not to the area of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa04">We are approaching the close of the twentieth century, of which no one speaks at length because of the expectations for the next millennium. But progress has certainly been achieved in this difficult century, at the cost of great suffering, in the area of the recognition and acceptance of the universality of human rights. For Chile, universality of human rights means that the intrinsic dignity of all inhabitants of the world must be respected, regardless of culture, religion, social status, ethnic origin, gender or traditions. Neither lack of development nor cultural characteristics can be invoked to justify a limitation of human rights as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the other conventions that constitute the universal system for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Reopening a debate on human rights and cultural diversity could mean, in the view of the Chilean delegation, a step backwards with regard to the universality and validity of those rights.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Schalin</span> <span class="nation">Finland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to explain our position on draft resolution II, entitled "Human rights and cultural diversity", and our vote on draft resolution XX, entitled "The right to development". I will first turn to resolution XX and make an explanation of vote on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa02">The European Union was unable to vote in support of the draft resolution. We sincerely regret that it was not possible to arrive at a consensus on the resolution this year. Indeed, on many occasions in the past, such consensus has been achieved. The European Union, because of its great interest in this matter, participated, as did many others, very actively in the informal consultations on the text. While we appreciate the flexibility shown by all involved in the negotiations and the willingness of the sponsors to accommodate many concerns, we regret that the sponsors decided to include a number of new elements which are not directly part of the subject matter under consideration and could not find consensus. We are also concerned about the new reporting obligations established by this resolution; these obligations prematurely change the mandate of the follow-up mechanism on the right to development, established at last year's session of the Commission on Human Rights. This change of the mandate has been effected even before the working group has started its work.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa03">The European Union stands prepared to work for the realization of the right to development in constructive partnership with all interested countries. For that purpose, we have great expectations and hopes for the follow-up mechanism, which was established with the support of all Member States. The vote on the resolution was particularly unfortunate in the run-up to the first meeting of the open-ended working group of the Commission on Human Rights, which was planned to take place this week, but had to be postponed again to a later date.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa04">The implementation of the right to development deserves active support from the international community. The European Union reiterates its willingness to continue, in a true partnership, its cooperation in implementing the right to development. Such partnership should, in our view, be reflected in a joint commitment to reach consensus in multilateral forums. We therefore hope that the open-ended working group on the right to development will be able to lay the foundations for a return to consensus on the important subject of the right to development.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa05">I will now turn to draft resolution II, entitled "Human rights and cultural diversity". I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated countries, Cyprus and Malta, as well as the European Free Trade Association countries and members of the European Economic Area, Iceland and Liechtenstein, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa06">Cultural, religious and linguistic diversity is a fundamental asset for humankind. For Europe, as for so many other regions around the world, multi-ethnic and multicultural diversity and interaction have created an enormously rich heritage. The European Union supports the importance of cultural diversity at all levels of society. We have not stood in the way of consensus on the resolution just adopted, regardless of our reservations with regard to the way it is drafted.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa07">The European Union remains of the view that the promotion and protection of human rights, including cultural rights, is the first responsibility of States, and they have the responsibility of ensuring the enjoyment of such rights by individuals within their jurisdiction. The Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the right of everyone to take part in cultural life. States have a duty to conserve, develop and diffuse science and culture, with a view to achieving the full realization of this right, which belongs to the individual. In a resolution on human rights and cultural diversity, the European Union would have liked to see this elementary cultural right referred to or reiterated. This idea, however, was not accepted by the sponsors of the resolution. Instead the draft resolution refers repeatedly to cultural diversity at the international level.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa08">The European Union agrees that all peoples have the right freely to pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The European Union is also of the view that this right can be fully realized only within democratic societies which respect the diversity and cultural rights of their members. Cultural diversity at the national level, between individuals and communities, flows directly from respect by the State for all human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa09">According to draft resolution II, cultural diversity at the international level is enjoyed by "nations" or "peoples" of the world. Such promotion of cultural diversity between nations could easily promote uniformity within nations -- at worst, even to the point where it would hamper the right of individuals to enjoy cultural diversity among themselves. The European Union is made uneasy by the possibility that nations, by actively identifying with a particular set of distinct cultural attributes, will in fact discourage tolerance for cultural expressions flowing from other sets of cultural attributes. Such a bias could, at worst, lead to limitations on the enjoyment of human rights by persons belonging to linguistic, religious or cultural minorities.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa10">For all these reasons, in the view of the European Union, the subject of cultural diversity at the international level would have been better addressed in the context of agenda item 34, entitled "Dialogue among civilizations". A draft resolution entitled "Human rights and cultural diversity", presented under a human rights item, should have remained focused at the national level, where human rights are primarily promoted, protected and respected.</p>

	<p id="pg026-bk11-pa02">Over the past year there has been a positive trend in the development of human rights in Iran. Local elections were held. Iranian women are increasingly participating in public life. Human rights, good governance and the rule of law have taken their place on the Iranian Government's agenda. Thailand recognizes and commends these sincere efforts that are being made by the Government of Iran, despite difficulties and obstacles. We believe that the Government of Iran will continue unwaveringly to redouble its efforts in this proper direction. For these reasons, Thailand will abstain in the voting.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk11-pa03">We also feel that dialogues being held both within the Iranian society and between Iran and the United Nations, including with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, will further constructively contribute to the progress that has been made by the present Government of Iran in promoting human rights.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ileka</span> <span class="nation">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">At this session my delegation has on many occasions had an opportunity to shed light on the armed conflict that has victimized my country. For almost two years there have been significant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law as a result of this conflict. My delegation would like again to emphasize the gravity of the situation, as the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Garreton, did. He most eloquently described the situation -- in particular as regards the atrocities -- and he clearly indicated who is responsible for these atrocities. As the international community knows, those responsible are the Government forces from Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi that are occupying the northern and eastern sections of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations, the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, and the Ceasefire Agreement that the Governments of these countries that are attacking my country signed with us on 10 July 1999 in Lusaka.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa02">During debates in the Committee on sub-item (c) of agenda item 116, my delegation in fact made a statement about the unfairness of the draft resolution that was introduced by the European Union and that appears as draft resolution IV in <a href="../pdf/A-54-605-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">document A/54/605/Add.3</a>. This draft resolution pretends to be based on Mr. Garreton's report, but in fact it constitutes an unacceptable denial of the most basic rights of the Congolese civilian population in the northern and eastern parts of the country, in particular, their right to life. Similarly, the European Union has overlooked the efforts made by my Government, as described by the Special Rapporteur, to promote and protect human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in spite of this unjust war.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa03">My delegation therefore notes with great regret that the philosophy underlying this draft resolution completely lacks objectivity and balance, and to such an extent that my delegation finds itself wondering whether the European Union -- by lending its support to the barbaric and murderous acts being committed against innocent Congolese victims by the aggressors, Rwandans in particular -- is not making itself the spokesperson for the very ideology it fought so hard against 50 years ago.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa04">In spite of this difficult period in my country's history, my Government reiterates its trust in the institutions of the United Nations. We believe that everything should be done in order not to hamper the progress that has been achieved by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations in the search for solutions to this tragedy.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa05">My delegation is also pleased that the United Nations is making further efforts in this regard and that it is attempting to work appropriately and effectively and with respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are particularly pleased by the establishment of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), whose many tasks include helping defend human rights, including those of children.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa06">As regards defending and protecting children's rights, my delegation wishes to pay tribute to the United Nations Children's Fund and to the Governments of Belgium and Canada for the major role that they have played in the successful holding of the Forum on the demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers, which was held in Kinshasa from 6 to 10 December last.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa07">In spite of the war taking place in our country, my Government, wishing to honour its international obligations regarding the protection and promotion of the rights of child soldiers, has taken a number of other protective measures -- to demobilize child soldiers, to reintegrate them into society and to prohibit the recruitment of minors. We would also like to announce that last week our Government declared a moratorium on capital punishment. Lastly, my Government has just issued an amnesty and released more than one hundred prisoners on 10 December, Human Rights Day.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa08">Rather than condemning the Democratic Republic of the Congo by the adoption of resolutions that are not at all motivated by humanitarian concerns, but rather by obscure political goals, the European Union could usefully give its support to my country through constructive cooperation for the defence and protection of human rights. My delegation feels entitled the expect from the European Union a sincere effort to better initiate and carry out a fruitful relationship and the necessary support in this field in accordance with the Congolese national programme.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa09">In this regard, and in accordance with the instruments to which it is party, my country is prepared to continue to display its good will with regard to human rights. I am also pleased to announce that through the establishment of the Supreme Court of Justice my Government has undertaken judiciary reform, and it reiterates its invitation to the international community to help us in this process. My Government believes that the international community would be doing useful work if it were to help our efforts in this respect, if it really wants to effectively tackle violations of human rights, to which effort it has committed itself.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, my Government wishes to state that in no way is it concerned by this draft resolution in the sense that the text is not concerned with the protection and promotion of human rights in my country. It is a text that is used by some for politicized goals that should not have been the subject of discussion in this Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa11">My delegation would also like to ask you, Mr. President, to please withdraw the question of the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the agenda of future sessions of the General Assembly. My Government would like to reassure you that it will continue its full cooperation with all United Nations bodies entrusted with issues of human rights and international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa12">Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the delegations that have understood the justice of our cause and that have given us unfailing support by voting against this resolution in the Third Committee. We ask them to continue to support us. As for those who were not able to do so in the past, we ask them to join us and vote against this resolution and thus do justice to the Congolese people, who have suffered so much from the ills of war and who do not need this new tribulation.</p>

	<p id="pg033-bk07-pa03">Moreover, China is always in favour of increased understanding and enhanced cooperation through exchanges and dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

We regret to note that it contains an attempt to partition that country among the Shi'a, Turkmen and Assyrians, as evidenced in paragraph 3 (j). Syria forcefully rejects this and any attempt to assail the territorial integrity of Iraq and to interfere in the northern part of that country under the pretext of defending human rights. Declarations on the creation of a security zone in northern Iraq and similar measures threaten the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa02">Moreover, the resolution once again proposes the adoption of and support for an institutionalized system of control over all human rights in any given country by deploying a human rights observer mission in Iraq.

<div class="spoken" id="pg034-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Spirollari</span> <span class="nation">Albania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg034-bk03-pa01">I should like to explain our vote on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-183.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 54/183</a> on the situation of human rights in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk03-pa02">The situation of human rights in Kosovo has been on the agenda of this body for a number of years now. The General Assembly quite justly drew the attention of the international community to the brutal and continuous violation of the human rights of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Despite the growing concern on this issue, the situation of human rights in Kosovo worsened, assuming the proportions of a threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk03-pa03">In the spring of this year, it reached the point of open conflict in Kosovo. The Serbian military and paramilitary, accompanied by the police forces and thugs, launched the most brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide in Europe since the end of the Second World War. One million ethnic Albanians were forced to leave their houses and lands under the threat of being killed. Thousands of people were killed and buried in mass graves all over Kosovo. Hundreds of thousands had to live in the open on root plants. The houses and businesses of ethnic Albanians were burned to ashes. A long trail of people -- women, children and the elderly -- walking for days or rushed in train-wagons towards neighbouring countries, readily recalled scenes from a reality that Europe had already left behind: the worst years of the Holocaust. Albania alone received around 500,000 people, which raised the local population by 15 per cent in a matter of days.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk03-pa04">In these circumstances, in order to preserve the sacred principles of the United Nations Charter and of humanitarian law, the international community intervened decisively to protect the population that was under threat of disappearance. The Albanians of Kosovo strongly supported this action and saw the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries as their sole protector and defender of human principles in the face of systematic oppression and long-term strategy of the Belgrade authorities to ethnically cleanse Kosovo of its indigenous Albanians.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk03-pa05">Today Kosovo is enjoying long-desired freedom. Over 90 per cent of the refugees are back, and 90 per cent of the schools are open. People are doing their best to rebuild their lives, and a sense of normalcy is being restored. The reality that only a few months ago was unthinkable is now taking shape with the presence of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR).</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk03-pa06">My delegation would like to express its appreciation and gratitude to the United States delegation for presenting for a second time a draft resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo. Although Albania was the main sponsor of such resolutions for a number of years, this time we were not able to co-sponsor it because of a principled position. The resolution does not have any reference to the will of the people of Kosovo, a reference that was a fundamental element of previous resolutions. It is our strong view that sustainable peace in the Balkans and the process of integration of that region into Europe would have to take into consideration the right to self-determination of Kosovars as a way towards a lasting solution, in accordance with the Rambouillet Accords. Any other solution precluding the people of Kosovo from expressing their will would be just another step away from peace and a way of ignoring reality.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg035-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bhattacharjee</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa01">I am speaking in explanation of vote on the resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa02">India voted against the resolution because it is inconsistent with the manner in which the question of human rights violations in the former Republic of Yugoslavia has been treated. On the one hand, we have but one resolution on the situation of human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -- three independent, sovereign nations; while, on the other hand, there is this resolution on a part of the territory of one of the countries dealt with in the other resolution. By implication, this treatment appears to treat Kosovo as an indeterminate territory, not as an integral part of the country concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa03">Secondly, the fundamental flaw in the resolution is that it is critical of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for all that is happening in Kosovo, ignoring the fact that Kosovo is administered by the United Nations, with the assistance of regional bodies. As the Special Rapporteur has noted, the human rights of the Serbs and other ethnic minorities, such as the Roma, are being violated despite their presence -- and not by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa04">Regrettably, this resolution represents the use of human rights as a political instrument. We deplore this, both because it politicizes human rights and because it calls into question the territorial integrity of a member State. We were unable to support this resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg035-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Naber</span> <span class="nation">Jordan</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa01">My delegation would like to mention, with reference to draft resolutions II and VII, that any unanimity on human rights should establish the fact that human rights belong to everyone, regardless of cultural, religious, racial or political orientation. In this regard, we have to refer to the major achievements of the world over the last half century in promoting, publicizing and strengthening respect for human rights on a very broad scale through the adoption of international instruments and conventions that deal with the protection of those rights, and the existence of the political will to apply them.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa02">The issue of human rights in all countries is legitimately a main concern for the world as a whole. In this respect, international monitoring of human rights standards could have a bearing on the sensitive issue of State sovereignty. Nevertheless, this sovereignty cannot be used to justify discrimination against persons or depriving them of their internationally guaranteed rights. The standards of human rights should provide the foundation for justice throughout the world, and the monitoring of their application must be looked at from a global, objective standpoint. Accountability should be based on recognized standards and norms.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk02-pa03">That is why my delegation believes all States and individuals have responsibility for the promotion of such norms through a constructive and sustained dialogue as an important step towards consensus. My delegation has taken into consideration the fact that a genuine and constructive dialogue is taking place with regard to draft resolutions II and VII under this agenda item.</p>

	<p id="pg035-bk04-pa03">In the eighth preambular paragraph of draft resolution III, we would request that the French translation of the English phrase "and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations" be made consistent with the Secretary-General's report from which it is quoted -- namely, <a href="../pdf/S-1999-896.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/896</a>, paragraph 104.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk04-pa04">In draft resolution VII, "Situation of human rights in the Sudan", we would request that operative paragraph 2, subparagraph (a) (i), be reflected as it was adopted in the Third Committee. It has been rearranged by editing. I will read it out as it is in document A/C.3/54/L.81, adopted in the Third Committee:</p>
