<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Alimov</span> <span class="nation">Tajikistan</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Today's meeting of the Security Council is taking place at a time of crucial importance for Tajikistan. On 6 November 1999, our country held presidential elections, with a choice of candidates. This was the most important and outstanding event in the political life of Tajikistan since the signing in June 1997 in Moscow of the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan. I should also like to recall that the elections took place after the successful holding, on 26 September this year, of a national referendum on changes and amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The presidential elections convincingly demonstrated that the main political forces in our country do indeed desire to find a constructive solution to their differences in the interests of moving the peace process forward on the basis of the implementation of the General Agreement. The elections were exceptionally important, not least because they were the first to be held in Tajikistan under the new conditions of political pluralism. The Islamic Revival Party, a political and religious opposition party, participated in the election campaign after having resumed its legal activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">As the Council knows, an absolute majority of voters throughout the country voted in favour of the current President of the Republic of Tajikistan. Despite the existing political, philosophical and religious differences in Tajik society, as a whole it thereby voiced its strong support for Emomali Rakhmonov and the policy that he has adopted for moving forward and strengthening the process of peace and national reconciliation. The presidential elections were an important step forward towards establishing lasting peace and stability and reliable conditions for further democratic development in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The successful implementation of these political measures and the further progress in implementing the General Agreement were helped to a large extent by the continuing generous support provided by the guarantor States, the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other international organizations directly involved in carrying out the work of strengthening peace in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">I would like to take this opportunity to convey my sincere thanks to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Tajikistan, Mr. Ivo Petrov, and to all the personnel of UNMOT, who in close cooperation with members of the Contact Group are continuing actively to help in the practical implementation of the General Agreement. We view the Security Council's intention to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) for a further six months as reflecting the Council's deep interest in strengthening and consolidating the vitally important results that have already been achieved, with United Nations assistance, in the peace process in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The full and active support of the United Nations will be decisive as Tajik society faces another very important political issue: the holding of the first parliamentary elections under the new conditions. The Commission on National Reconciliation is already drafting a law on elections to the Majlis-i Oli, the Parliament of our republic. The draft law is to be submitted to the President by 20 November. This important work is being done with assistance from the joint OSCE/United Nations assessment mission, which will soon visit Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">We are pleased to note that by the draft resolution, the Security Council would welcome the signing on 5 November 1999, at Dushanbe, by the President of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali S. Rakhmonov, and by the Chairman of the Commission on National Reconciliation, Mr. Abdullo Nuri, of the Protocol on political guarantees for the preparation and conduct of the parliamentary elections. We are glad that members of the Council view this as a necessary basis for the careful preparation of those elections, which will meet international standards.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">The Government of Tajikistan is sincerely resolved to create all conditions necessary for ensuring that the forthcoming elections to the two-chamber Parliament will constitute a new milestone in our progress towards strengthening the democratic basis for the viability of the whole of Tajik society, so that we can enter the twenty-first century in step with the rest of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Tajikistan has high hopes that the international community will increase its efforts to support democratic change in our country, <i>inter alia</i>, by responding with due generosity to the consolidated inter-agency appeal for 2000. We view comprehensive international support as an important, indeed vital, factor for ensuring that the peace process in our country is irreversible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">I wish in conclusion to emphasize that Tajikistan is sincerely grateful to the United Nations and to the Security Council for the attention they have devoted to our problems and for their efforts to resolve them. We are grateful that the international community is increasingly focusing its efforts not so much on dealing with the direct consequences of the past internal conflict in our country but rather on providing comprehensive assistance to the consistent implementation in Tajikistan of socio-economic and democratic reforms, which are strongly supported by the leadership of our country.</p>
