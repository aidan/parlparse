	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">Members will recall that at its 79th plenary meeting, on 20 December 2002, the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-300.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 57/300</a>, entitled "Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change". In paragraph 37 of that resolution, the General Assembly</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">"Notes the proposal of the Secretary-General for a single-stage intergovernmental review of the programme budget and medium-term plan, contained in action 22 of his report, and requests the Secretary-General to submit a report clarifying his proposal for consideration by the General Assembly at its resumed fifty-seventh session."</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa03">In that connection, the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change -- Intergovernmental review of the medium-term plan and the programme budget", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-786.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/786</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa04">In numerous consultations I have held with Member States it was repeatedly suggested that the discussion of this report in plenary meeting be postponed to the fifty-eighth session, a time during which other issues and reports related to the agenda item entitled "Strengthening of the United Nations system" would be considered.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa05">On 10 June 2003, I addressed a letter to all Permanent Representatives to the United Nations requesting their views on a proposal to defer consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on the intergovernmental review of the medium-term plan and the programme budget to the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa06">In the absence of objection, it is my intention to propose to the General Assembly that it defer consideration of the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change -- Intergovernmental review of the medium-term plan and the programme budget" to the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa07">I see no objection.

	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">During the course of its resumed session, from 5 to 30 May and on 2 and 4 June 2003, the Fifth Committee held 11 formal meetings and numerous informal meetings. In accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-233.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 49/233</a>, of 23 December 1994, the resumed session of the Fifth Committee was devoted primarily to the consideration of issues related to the financing of United Nations peacekeeping missions and related peacekeeping issues.

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk16">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Stoffer</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk16-pa01">My delegation wishes to make a statement for the record on draft resolution II in the report of the Fifth Committee on agenda item 112 (<a href="../pdf/A-57-649-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/57/649/Add.2</a>) with respect to the financial situation of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW).</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk16-pa02">In the Third Committee last fall, the United States voted against the draft resolution that opened the way for INSTRAW to receive funding from the United Nations regular budget for 2002-2003. On 4 June of this year, the Fifth Committee adopted draft resolution <a href="../pdf/AC.5-57-L.88.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.5/57/L.88</a>. The United States dissociated itself from consensus on that occasion, and we do so again today.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk16-pa03">The United States has opposed funding INSTRAW from the regular budget because it is supposed to be an institution funded from voluntary contributions. That is the mandate INSTRAW received from the Economic and Social Council. Despite that mandate, the United States reluctantly allowed INSTRAW to receive funding from the regular budget on two recent occasions. On the first occasion, in December 2001, we allowed a subvention of $600,000 for INSTRAW with the understanding that it would be the last request for funds from the regular budget. Again in December 2002, we were asked to accept an additional regular budget allocation for INSTRAW. The second request was for $250,000 from the contingency fund to provide sufficient resources to allow INSTRAW to hire a Director and to raise voluntary funds. We were again assured that it would be the last request for funds from the regular budget. Now we are assembled here again to approve an additional $250,000 for INSTRAW from the regular budget's contingency fund.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk16-pa04">I wish to make clear that the United States will strongly oppose any further funding for INSTRAW from the United Nations regular budget. Moreover, it is our view that resources in the contingency fund are to be used for the most urgent needs of the United Nations. The Contingency Fund was not established for funding ongoing research and training activities, and especially not for an institution that is to be voluntarily funded.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk16-pa05">The Economic and Social Council established INSTRAW as an independent, voluntarily funded institution. Failure to fulfil its mandate, however, will mean that the institution may no longer endure. Therefore, for all of the reasons just stated, the United States dissociates itself from consensus on draft resolution II.</p>

With the presentation today of <a href="../pdf/A-57-522-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/522/Add.1</a>, which introduces the draft resolution submitted under item 78 to the General Assembly by the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), the reporting obligations of the Fourth Committee for and to this session of the General Assembly are fulfilled.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk22-pa02">The Special Political and Decolonization Committee considered the item at its 12th to 15th meetings during the first part of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly and again at its resumed session on 28 May 2003. At its resumed session the Special Political and Decolonization Committee took up the item and examined the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations and adopted a draft resolution without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk22-pa03">The draft resolution submitted under item 78 is contained in paragraph 8 of the report. In its operative paragraphs the draft resolution recommended by the Special Political and Decolonization Committee welcomes the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations; endorses the proposals, recommendations and conclusions of the Special Committee contained in paragraphs 39 to 206 of its report; and urges Member States to take all necessary steps to implement them. The draft resolution also reiterates the conditions under which personnel-contributing countries may become members of the Special Committee, decides that the Special Committee shall continue its efforts and requests it to submit a report on its work to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk22-pa04">I now have the honour to present to the General Assembly for its consideration and adoption the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-57-522-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/522/Add.1</a>, entitled "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects".</p>
