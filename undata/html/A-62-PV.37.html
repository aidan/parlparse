<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hannesson</span> <span class="nation">Iceland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">Let me start by thanking Director General ElBaradei for his comprehensive report on the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">Iceland is among the States sponsoring the draft resolution on the report of the IAEA.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The IAEA celebrated its fiftieth anniversary last July. Iceland would like to reaffirm its commitment to the organization and its valuable role in international nuclear cooperation and nuclear safety. The three pillars of the IAEA's Statute -- safety and security, science and technology, and safeguards and verification -- remain solid. But the verification of the peaceful uses of nuclear materials in order to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons is currently facing its greatest challenge. We as Member States cannot spare any effort to secure a high level of safety in all nuclear and radiological applications and installations. My country strongly supports international cooperation in order to maintain and improve safety in that area, and reiterates the important and indispensable role of the IAEA in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">Iceland attaches great importance to the IAEA's technical cooperation work aimed at the use of nuclear technology in a safe, secure and sustainable manner. That includes the areas of human health, food and agriculture, nuclear science and the management of radioactive waste. Nuclear technology plays an important role in combating the spread of disease and hunger, in particular in developing countries. Iceland recognizes that valuable work, an makes an annual voluntary contribution to the IAEA's technology fund.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">We welcome recent developments with regard to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Iceland appreciates the swift response by the IAEA in February following the diplomatic breakthrough. The shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities and the implementation of verification and monitoring measures by the IAEA are important first steps. We urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to resume the implementation of its comprehensive safeguards agreement under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">With respect to the nuclear activities of Iran, we hope that the current work plan between the IAEA and Iran will lead to a resolution of outstanding questions. Effective implementation of the work plan is of course a prerequisite for any progress. However, we still have strong concerns concerning the implications of Iran's nuclear programme. We regret that Iran has not fulfilled its obligations under Security Council resolutions or the requirements established by the IAEA. The Government of Iran must take steps to build confidence with regard to the scope and nature of its nuclear programme. We urge Iran to ratify and bring into force the additional protocol to the comprehensive safeguards agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">In conclusion, the IAEA is indispensable for nuclear cooperation and global nuclear safety. I reiterate Iceland's full support for the organization, and our willingness to contribute to its work and cooperation efforts.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gumbi</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">My delegation would also like to thank the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the very insightful annual report of the Agency covering the year 2006. We commend the Agency for yet another elaborate and user-friendly report on achievements and shortcomings in the areas of technology, safety and verification, which are the three pillars of the Agency's mandate to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">The annual report of the Agency for 2006 has once more strengthened our correctness in recognizing the Agency as the leading multilateral institution for ensuring the peaceful uses of nuclear energy as set out in article II of the IAEA's Statute. This annual report has also reaffirmed my delegation's belief that the peaceful application of nuclear energy has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to the improvement of living standards, the fight against poverty and the promotion of sustainable development, thereby strengthening international peace and security and facilitating the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">Our meeting is taking place at a time when there is a worldwide increase in the number of countries that are considering the nuclear power option in their national energy mix to meet their energy demands. We are indeed in an era where nuclear power is suddenly gaining prominence because of the potential it has to place countries in a better position to enhance the security of energy supplies and to mitigate the discharge of carbon into the atmosphere, as the energy produced from fossil fuel accounts for about half of human-made greenhouse gases.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">The rise in the demand for nuclear power comes with challenges and responsibilities. Nuclear material and its production have become harder to control. There is an increase in the number of countries seeking to master the nuclear fuel cycle to ensure a supply of nuclear fuel. In turn, mastering the fuel cycle, and the ability arising therefrom to enrich uranium or separate plutonium, brings more countries closer to a nuclear weapons capability. Needless to say, this all has a direct bearing on the Agency's verification activities, technical cooperation assistance, nuclear fuel management and nuclear safety and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa05">My delegation is concerned that in budgeting for the Agency there are always inadequate funds for necessary technological innovation investments. South Africa believes that that situation needs to be corrected in order to extricate the Agency from the predicament of having to rely on one or a few countries' technical resources to carry out its verification mandate. That unjustified dependency has the potential to put into question IAEA's verification findings and will ultimately undermine the credibility of its verification function.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa06">That near-crisis situation is further exacerbated by the small number of safeguards agreements between the Agency and its member States. That matter requires our urgent and serious attention, because there are some States that have yet to take the first basic step required by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to put into force comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency. We call on those States to fulfil their obligations under article III of the NPT as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa07">The Agency's safeguards system is not a static one, but it needs to be adapted to changing circumstances. It is for that reason that South Africa supported -- unfortunately, to no avail -- attempts at the recently concluded IAEA General Conference aimed at strengthening the safeguards system through the incorporation into the safeguards resolution language directly derived from article III.B, paragraph 1, of the IAEA Statute, as well as from step 10 of the 13 practical steps for nuclear disarmament agreed at the 2000 NPT Review Conference. The rejection of these proposals is a cause for concern for my delegation and seems to represent a tendency by some Member States to renege on commitments made when joining the Agency and on their previous undertakings made in the NPT. We also wonder if these negative developments are not a manifestation of complacency and the false belief that the safeguards system has been perfected.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa08">Notwithstanding, South Africa recognizes the indispensable role that the Additional Protocol can play as an additional measure to provide the necessary confidence and the desired assurances that Member States apply their nuclear technology solely for peaceful purposes and that no declared or undeclared material is diverted to weapons programmes. South Africa believes that countries with access to advanced technologies bear a greater responsibility to provide such assurances and to build confidence in the peaceful nature of their nuclear programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa09">Inasmuch as the Additional Protocol is voluntary, South Africa believes that it is an important confidence- and security-building measure that continues to play an essential role in creating an environment conducive to nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation but that it should not be used as a condition for supplying nuclear material. As stated in previous occasions, South Africa will continue to reject that discriminatory attempt.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa10">In addition to strengthening the Agency's verification function in these challenging moments, South Africa believes the Agency's Technical Cooperation Fund deserves urgent and decisive action. This Fund is a statutory and political commitment that needs to be realized. The technical cooperation projects of the Agency constitute important building blocks to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in the areas of water security, environmental sustainability, maternal and child health and the combating of disease, hunger and poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa11">Over the years, the developing countries have repeatedly stressed that the funding of the Agency's technical cooperation projects must be sufficient, predictable and assured. They have also stressed the need for the technical cooperation budget to be increased, as it is clearly not sufficient. South Africa believes that the time has arrived to conclusively correct the mistake of the past fifty years by incorporating the funding of technical cooperation projects into the regular budget.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa12">Likewise, my delegation expresses its fullest support for the proposal of the Director General to engage a high-level panel of experts to study, review and consider options for financing the Agency's requirements. South Africa is of the view that the findings of this process should be engaged in a constructive manner and be carefully considered with a view to making appropriate recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa13">The supply of nuclear fuel is a factor that will play a prominent role in the anticipated future growth of nuclear power. In this connection South Africa has been following with keen interest the debate and various proposals on multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, as well as developments in the area of research reactor conversion and highly enriched uranium repatriation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa14">With regard to the nuclear fuel cycle, South Africa has noted with deep concern that a number of proposals made on this matter during the last few years are geared towards restricting the right of countries to develop domestic capabilities. Such conditionalities do not only contradict the inalienable right of States to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful purposes as provided for in the NPT, but also exacerbate existing inequalities, including through the creation of another kind of cartel that would exclude full participation, particularly by States in full compliance with their safeguards obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa15">South Africa thinks that it is imperative to ensure that no unwarranted restrictions are imposed. What is required is a non-discriminatory approach that would assure the reliable supply of nuclear fuel, while fully respecting the choices of States and protecting their inalienable right to pursue peaceful nuclear programmes, consistent with their non-proliferation obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa16">South Africa is considering options for cooperation with other countries over the entire nuclear-fuel cycle, from the mining and processing of uranium through to nuclear power generation, fuel reprocessing and the disposal of nuclear waste. South Africa has also produced a draft nuclear energy policy and strategy paper for public comment. Given the scale of the intended South African nuclear programme and the need for regulatory efficiency, it is envisaged that all the regulatory functions -- such as environmental, design, construction, operations, decommissioning and decontamination processes -- will be centralized in a single nuclear and radiation safety statutory agency.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa17">While South Africa acknowledges that prevailing proliferation concerns have prompted others to propose restrictions and controls over the legitimate peaceful uses of nuclear energy, it is important that such concerns be matched by reinforcement of the obligation to achieve nuclear disarmament.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa18">My delegation would also like recall, for the benefit of this gathering, its position on research reactor conversion and highly enriched uranium (HEU) repatriation. As South Africa pointed out at the International Symposium on HEU in Norway in June last year, we are supportive of national efforts towards the conversion of civilian facilities from HEU to low enriched uranium (LEU), but we caution against attempts aimed at efforts related to the reduction of HEU for peaceful civilian purposes. Such national decisions are indeed laudable and, in our view, are contributing in a very real way towards minimizing the inherent risks associated with HEU.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa19">However, if we are indeed concerned about and committed to reducing threats to our collective security, and not merely the real or perceived threats against a select few, we cannot exclusively focus on reducing reliance on HEU for peaceful purposes, without any real commitment and progress towards the elimination of HEU and other fissile materials that are primarily being used for military purposes. In South Africa's view, the threat to our very existence constituted by the continued utilization of such material for weapons purposes remains as real as ever.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa20">Nuclear safety is fast proving to be an integral part of nuclear programmes and will require serious consideration as more countries are considering the introduction or expansion of nuclear power. South Africa commends the Agency for its work in the area of nuclear safety and supports the various safety standards, guides and requirements. South Africa welcomes the networking practices to improve the global nuclear safety regime and has taken the initiative to establish an African forum of nuclear regulators to share experiences and has requested the Agency to provide guidance and assistance in this endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa21">South Africa is committed to the use of IAEA Safety Standards as a benchmark in the implementation of our regulatory mandate and supports the IAEA initiative related to the rationalization and harmonization of the Safety Standards. South Africa would like to recommend a greater harmonization of the requirements related to safety and those related to security, as those requirements are interdependent in many cases.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa22">South Africa remains seriously concerned and shares the international community's concern over nuclear security. South Africa agrees that the threat of nuclear terrorism is one of the challenges the world faces in reaching our common goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. Although each and every State has the responsibility to control and secure fissile material or other nuclear materials and to prevent such materials from being illegally obtained or used, relevant instruments can and should play an important role in strengthening our national and collective efforts in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa23">The issue of protection against nuclear terrorism lies very much at the heart of South Africa's concerns as we may draw from the Agency's expertise and require equipment for the array of security measures to be put in place for the soccer world championship in South Africa in 2010.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa24">In conclusion, South Africa believes that continuous and irreversible progress in nuclear disarmament and other related nuclear arms control measures remain fundamental to the promotion of nuclear non-proliferation. The systematic and progressive elimination of all nuclear weapons and the assurance that they will never be produced again remains the only assurance against their use. That should remain our goal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa25">Nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin, and are mutually reinforcing. The verifiable and irreversible elimination of nuclear weapons should prevent the use of nuclear weapons, irrespective of whose hands they are in. That would effectively curb their proliferation, because one cannot proliferate what one does not have.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa26">Last but not least, my delegation associates itself with the statement made this morning by the Ambassador of Benin on behalf of the Group of African States. South Africa will also support, and has co-sponsored, the draft resolution on the IAEA, which was introduced by the Chairperson of the Agency's Board of Governors.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khazaee</span> <span class="nation">Iran</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">Allow me, at the outset, to express our gratitude to Mr. ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his tireless efforts and for the insightful report to the General Assembly on the main activities of the Agency during the year 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The report indicates that the Agency is increasingly developing its activities in many areas of nuclear technology that are of great interest and importance to the human community. The IAEA was established with the principal objective of accelerating and enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. The ever-increasing demands of member States for the use of nuclear science and associated technology to sustainably meet their socio-economic requirements underscore the need to ensure comprehensive fulfilment of the Agency's main responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">It is a well-recognized fact that nuclear technology has broad peaceful applications in numerous fields -- ranging from food production, human health, water resources management and agricultural and industrial applications to providing a renewable source of energy. In particular, the IAEA has a specific mandate in relation to nuclear power. Access to reliable and adequate sources of energy is essential for development. The demand for energy around the world continues to increase rapidly. That has led a number of countries, in particular developing countries, to embark upon planning for the construction of nuclear power reactors, as well as for significant expansion in their existing programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">As the report indicates, for the first time, the latest projections recognize that nuclear power will not only help to meet the increased demand for energy supplies but will also mitigate the discharge of carbon into the atmosphere. In that context, efforts to strengthen the Agency's technical cooperation activities aimed at improving the capabilities of developing countries in nuclear energy production, as a component of their energy mix, should be pursued as a matter of priority.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) reaffirmed the important objectives of the Agency and recognized the inalienable right of all States parties to the NPT to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Under article IV of the NPT, States parties undertook to facilitate the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In fact, the inalienable right of all NPT States parties to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, without discrimination, constitutes one of the three major pillars upon which the NPT is founded. Notwithstanding such requirements, the cooperation of developed countries -- as the main suppliers of sophisticated nuclear technology -- with developing nations has remained at an unsatisfactory level. In fact, nuclear cooperation between suppliers and recipients has been beset by restrictions, obstacles and disruptions. Instead of promoting cooperation, the club of nuclear haves, which is laden with discrimination and a lack of transparency, was created, inter alia, to hamper the access of developing members of the NPT to nuclear power technology, under the pretext of non-proliferation concerns. To remedy that shortcoming, the IAEA could and should play a decisive role by vigorously pursuing balanced and non-discriminatory application of the provisions of the NPT and IAEA safeguards.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">Moreover, it is unfortunate that, after 50 years of existence, the budget of the international cooperation section of the Agency remains unsteady due to its voluntary nature and the conditionality imposed by certain member States on its allocations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">The application of safeguards is among the main functions of the Agency. While great efforts have been made by the Agency to apply and promote the universality of the safeguards system to all relevant nuclear activities, it is distressing that some members of the Agency have yet to conclude their comprehensive safeguards agreements. We call on all such members to fulfil their obligations at the earliest possible time.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">Furthermore, there is a dangerous trend at work that is moving in the opposite direction of safeguarding the NPT and ensuring its universality. Under that trend, those who have chosen not to accede to the NPT not only are not subject to any pressure to do so, but are also encouraged and rewarded in different ways. For an example, the Zionist regime has been allowed to acquire a large stockpile of nuclear weapons in the volatile Middle East region, and to defy the will of all the States of the region and the international community to turn the Middle East into a zone free of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa09">The Islamic Republic of Iran considers the development of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to be its inalienable right. We have therefore invested extensive human and material resources in the field of nuclear power, within the framework of the country's overall economic plan.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa10">As we have stressed time and again, Iran's nuclear programme is completely peaceful. All reports issued by the IAEA since November 2003 have been indicative of the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. The Agency has repeatedly reaffirmed that it "has not seen indications of diversion of nuclear material to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices". That assertion has also been attested to by the Director General of the IAEA in his various public statements. Nevertheless, in an unwarranted move orchestrated by a few of its permanent members, the Security Council has taken unlawful, unnecessary and unjustifiable actions against the peaceful nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Indeed, Iran's peaceful nuclear programme poses no threat to international peace and security. Therefore, dealing with this issue in the Security Council is unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa11">Without a doubt, the move to bring the Iranian nuclear file to the Security Council and the intention of the co-sponsors of the resolutions adopted thus far have been derived from their ulterior motives and narrow national considerations in order to deprive the Iranian people of their inalienable rights, rather than emanating from so-called proliferation concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa12">Despite the politically motivated actions by a few countries, which have led to the deadlock and interruption of negotiations, the Islamic Republic of Iran has, once again, taken a new initiative that has received worldwide support and appreciation. In that context, Iran agreed to take a major step in negotiating with the Agency on the modalities of dealing with the few outstanding issues. As a result of intensive negotiations which were held between the two sides, the final text of the mutual understanding, reflected in the Agency's document <a href="../pdf/INFCIRC-711.pdf" class="nolink">INFCIRC/711</a>, was concluded on 21 August 2007 in Tehran.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa13">Bearing in mind past experience in dealing with such technical issues with the Agency, it was agreed that all issues should be taken up in a sequential and well-defined time frame, rather than dealing with them simultaneously and without prioritization. In a very short period of time, two of the major remaining issues, namely plutonium experimentation and the contamination at the Karaj facility, were resolved.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa14">According to the agreed work plan, the issues of P-1 and P-2 centrifuges are under extensive discussion. In order to carry these discussion forward, several meetings have been held between Iranian and IAEA officials in a professional and cooperative atmosphere. At present, the new round of such meetings is taking place in Tehran.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa15">As the IAEA Director General reported to the Board of Governors, the agreed work plan is "a significant step forward". Therefore, it is essential to note that Iran's initiative has created a new and positive environment that necessitates the return of its nuclear dossier to the Agency's framework in full. In our view, the right path for the peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue goes through dialogue and technical elaboration within its proper and legal context, which is the framework of the IAEA.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa16">In the same vein, I wish to echo the view expressed by many delegations that the Iranian nuclear issue needs to be settled through multilateral means, and that resorting to unilateral measures would only exacerbate the situation and complicate its resolution. There is no doubt that the recent United States unilateral measures against Iran only seek to undermine the current negotiations and cooperation between Iran and the Agency. In this respect, it suffices to make it clear that no number of irrational United States policies will be able to dissuade us from pursuing our legitimate rights and interests. We have already enunciated our position on this issue in detail, both here in New York and in the capital.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa17">Finally, the people and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran are determined to exercise their inalienable right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and to build on their own scientific advances in developing various peaceful aspects of this technology. Iran commits itself to its obligations under the NPT and does not request anything more than the exercise of its inalienable rights.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Park Hee-kwon</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">At the outset, my delegation would like to express its sincere appreciation to Mr. ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his comprehensive report on the Agency's activities. We are pleased to take note of the Agency's recent achievements in the fields of technology, safety and security and verification, which are described in the annual report of the IAEA for 2006. In addition, my delegation commends the Director General and his staff for their dedication to fulfilling their responsibilities with integrity and professionalism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">As a strong supporter of the work of the IAEA, the Republic of Korea underlines the importance of promoting the safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology, and is committed to maintaining full cooperation in all areas of the Agency's activities. In this regard, my delegation would like to highlight some issues that we consider relevant to the future development of the IAEA.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">First, we believe that the universalization of the Model Additional Protocol is an essential means for improving the current safeguards and verification regime. We fully share the Director General's view that only for those States with comprehensive safeguards agreements and the additional protocols in place will the Agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear material or activities be fully realized. In this regard, my delegation hopes that those States that have not done so will sign, ratify and fully implement additional protocols without undue delay.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Secondly, the Republic of Korea attaches great importance to the development of a new multilateral framework for the nuclear fuel cycle. My Government supports initiatives to develop a mechanism to provide reliable and equitable access to nuclear technologies and fuel while limiting proliferation risks. As a major user of nuclear energy, the Republic of Korea will continue to participate in and make positive contributions to the relevant discussions on this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">Thirdly, we believe that the peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be promoted, ensuring a high standard of nuclear safety and security. In this regard, the Republic of Korea will continue to support the Agency's efforts to build and strengthen an international nuclear safety and security regime and further enhance its cooperation with the Agency.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">My delegation would like to take this opportunity to briefly highlight the recent developments in the Six-Party Talks process. Since the resumption of the Fifth Round of the Six-Party Talks in February of this year, there has been significant progress in realizing the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005. On 13 February 2007, the Six Parties agreed on the Initial Actions for the Implementation of the Joint Statement, taking that consensus forward another step by laying out specific actions to implement the Joint Statement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">The 13 February agreement paved the way for re-establishing the relationship between the IAEA and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, resulting in visits to that country by Agency teams and an agreement between the two parties on an ad hoc arrangement for monitoring and verification of the Democratic People's Republic's Yongbyon nuclear facility. Since July of this year, the Agency has been able to verify the shutdown of the Yongbyon facility and is continuing to implement the ad hoc arrangement, with the cooperation of the Democratic People's Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">My delegation welcomes the Agency's successful implementation of the ad hoc arrangement and reiterates its support and appreciation to the Director General and his staff for conducting the monitoring and verification activities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a timely, impartial and professional manner.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">Following the 13 February agreement, another step forward was taken during the Second Session of the Sixth Round of the Talks, held in Beijing from 27 to 30 September 2007, at which the Six Parties reached agreement on the Second-Phase Actions for the Implementation of the September 2005 Joint Statement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">According to that agreement, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will complete the disablement of the 5-megawatt experimental reactor, the reprocessing plant and the nuclear fuel rod fabrication plant at Yongbyon by the end of this year. It is expected that the actual disablement process will start in early November. In addition, the Democratic People's Republic will provide a complete and correct declaration of all of its nuclear programmes, in accordance with the 13 February agreement, within the same time frame. The other five parties also agreed, in turn, to take corresponding measures in accordance with the 13 February agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa11">If the declaration and the disablement measures are smoothly implemented, we believe that we can achieve the main process of abandonment of these nuclear facilities by next year. Completing these second-phase actions in a timely manner will give impetus to the negotiations aimed at achieving the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner. To that end, my delegation hopes that the Six Parties will continue to take further steps without delay, in accordance with their commitments, towards the full implementation of the Joint Statement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa12">As the Six-Party Talks process continues, my Government will continue to work closely with all parties concerned for a peaceful resolution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear issue and trusts that the international community will continue to render its valuable support in that regard.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Figueiredo</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">On behalf of the Republic of Angola, it is my pleasure to congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to preside over the work of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. Allow me also to extend my congratulations to the other members of the Bureau. We are confident that under his able leadership the session will successfully conclude its work. He can be assured of our full support and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">This year, we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). For the past 50 years the organization has carried out its mandate with efficiency and credence. The Nobel Peace Prize awarded in 2005 to the Agency and to its Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, was a tribute to the professional and impartial performance over the last half century. The Angolan Government would therefore like to reiterate its support for and full confidence in the Director General and the secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">The Agency's report in document GC(51)-5 correctly reflects the work carried out by the organization during the year 2006 under the three pillars of its mandate, namely, technology, safety and security, and verification. It clearly illustrates that the Agency continued to carry out a wide range of activities related to the application of nuclear technologies in areas such as human health, food and agriculture, industry, water resources management, the environment, knowledge management and nuclear energy planning and production, thereby contributing to sustainable development in Members States, especially in the developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The Agency's Technical Cooperation Programme is the main statutory vehicle for cost-effective transfer of nuclear technologies and know-how to Member States. To encourage greater self-reliance, the Agency helps to build, strengthen and maintain national and regional capacities for using nuclear technology in a safe, secure and sustainable manner.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">The Technical Cooperation Programme helps developing countries in matching appropriate technologies to identified needs and in building relevant national technical competencies and expertise. In that context, we wish to underscore that the promotion of the peaceful applications of atomic energy constitutes a fundamental element of the core activities of the Agency and is of the utmost importance to developing countries for the improvement of their socio-economic condition. We therefore believe that insufficient and unpredictable funding of the Technical Cooperation Programme would have a negative impact on the promotional activities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">In that connection, we wish to recall a resolution of the Agency's General Conference, resolution GC(50)RES-12, which in its preamble states that the financing of technical cooperation should be in line with the concept of shared responsibility, under which there is a common engagement towards financing and enhancing the activities of the Agency.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">The Angolan Government encourages all Member States to pay their contributions to the regular budget and the Technical Cooperation Fund in full and on time. The payment of extrabudgetary contributions for the financing of projects that are Board approved but for which no immediate funds are available for implementation should not be neglected.  The  Republic of Angola became a member of the IAEA eight years ago, and we are among the States which regularly pay their assessed contributions to the organization. The Angolan Government appreciates the assistance from which the country benefits within the framework of the IAEA's technical cooperation programme.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">At present, the ongoing technical cooperation programme consists of nine projects dealing with the establishment of the first radiotherapy centre, introduction of nuclear medicine techniques to clinical practices, veterinary drug residue monitoring, isotope techniques to study the effect of bio and inorganic fertilizers, mutation breeding and the establishment of non-destructive testing laboratories for industrial applications.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Angola is also taking part in several regional and interregional projects included in the African Regional Co-operative Agreement for Research (AFRA) programmes. In this context, we would like to underline the importance of the IAEA project on coastal zone management, which addresses the adverse effects of harmful algal blooms and in which Namibia and the Republic of South Africa are also participating.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">In addition, the IAEA has provided assistance to my country in establishing the legal framework and regulatory infrastructure for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. On 28 June a national atomic energy law was promulgated as an important step towards the establishment of a national radiation protection institute, which will become a reality in the near future. In this regard, we wish to thank the IAEA for its valuable support.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">For the 2009-2011 technical cooperation programming cycle, the Angolan Government has submitted for the IAEA's consideration six project concepts in the areas of nuclear physics, agriculture, human health, water resources, industrial applications and radiation protection. The projects involve the use of nuclear control systems, isotope hydrology for sustainable management of groundwater resources, sustaining national capability in maintenance and repair, improvement of beans through mutation breeding, the extension of a nuclear physics teaching laboratory to phase II and the strengthening of national capacity in medical physics. For considerations of efficiency, the IAEA organizes training courses, seminars, workshops, scientific visits and fellowships and provides expert advice and equipment.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa12">My Government recognizes that the strengthening of the IAEA's technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful use of atomic energy, and its practical applications, will substantially contribute to the well-being and quality of life of the peoples of the world, particularly those of developing member States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa13">However, we believe that for many developing countries, in particular Africa, the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger by 50 per cent by 2015, as foreseen by the United Nations, requires especially the eradication or control of cancer, tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis, HIV/AIDS, anopheles mosquitoes and malaria, and locusts, among other things. All these factors are additional hindrances to socio-economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa14">Global warming as a consequence of the atmospheric pollution resulting from human activity, which has been causing dramatic and dangerous climate changes, has become a serious threat to development and the security of humanity. We believe that as a first step to countering this scourge, all countries should sign and implement the international protocols relating to the protection of the environment, such as the Kyoto and Montreal Protocols. In this regard, my Government welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-General in inviting the countries that are major polluters of the atmosphere to contribute to its protection more resources.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa15">With regard to cancer, we appreciate the policy of seeking to develop a strategy for the implementation of the Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT). We encourage the IAEA to proceed in its collaboration with other relevant national, regional and international organizations to foster the development of cost-effective systems for radiation treatment of cancer. In the same vein, we appeal to all member States to continue making contributions to PACT to enable the achievement of its goal, inter alia, to assist developing countries in integrating radiotherapy into the broader framework of cancer prevention and control. We also welcome the voluntary contributions of some member States, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International Development, the United States National Cancer Institute and private corporations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa16">Regarding the tsetse fly and the trypanosomiasis disease it transmits, my country supports the IAEA's activities aimed at the eradication or control of the tsetse fly through the use of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). We appreciate its continued support to African member States in their efforts to build national capabilities and further develop techniques for applying SIT in the creation of tsetse-free zones. We also appreciate the Agency's support for the African Union's Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign in its contribution to the implementation of plan of action in some countries on the continent.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa17">Taking into account the progress achieved in the application of SIT in combating tsetse fly in some African countries, Angola wishes to encourage the IAEA, in partnership with other relevant organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization, to further strengthen their research with a view to utilizing SIT in the control or eradication of the anopheles mosquito and malaria, locusts and other insects which hinder the socio-economic development of the continent. In the same context, we welcome the decision of the United Nations Regional Consultation on the New Partnership for Africa's Development, held in Algiers in July 2006, where methods and techniques for the integrated campaign against locusts were discussed and where recommendations emerged for the integration of nuclear applications in eliminating these insects and in establishing regional centres for studies and training in this field.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa18">Last but not least, HIV/AIDS has been one of the most serious public health problems in modern history since its discovery in 1981. This disease is a far worse problem in some parts of the world than in others. Most people infected with AIDS live in the developing countries of Asia and Africa, while most of the deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS retards economic growth by destroying human capital and, consequently, increasing poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa19">In this context, we encourage the IAEA, in partnership with relevant national, regional and international organizations, to explore new possibilities to counter this ever-growing scourge. The Angolan Government notes with appreciation the regional project, Initiatives in HIV -- molecular epidemiology and immunology, in support of the WHO/UNAIDS African AIDS Vaccine Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa20">With regard to nuclear verification, the nuclear non-proliferation and arms control regime continues to face a broad set of challenges. The Government of Angola is of the view that it is important to reinforce the monitoring of the application of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to move towards global disarmament. We appreciate all pertinent initiatives taken in compliance with United Nations Charter, according to the concept of multilateralism and the principles which govern relations between States. That means the equality of all States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa21">Angola, like the great majority of other members of the Assembly, recognizes the inalienable right of all States to produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In this context, my Government appreciates and supports the initiative to assist developing countries interested in small and medium-sized reactors, in order to address economic development while protecting the environment and ensuring safety and security.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa22">The Angolan Government associates itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Benin on behalf of the African States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa23">To conclude, the Government of the Republic of Angola recommends the approval of the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency by the General Assembly.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ali</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I wish to join previous speakers in thanking the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for his presentation to the Assembly of the annual report of the Agency for 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">Malaysia highly appreciates the IAEA's role in assisting developing Member States in planning for and in the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes. However, more should be done to advance the inalienable rights of developing Member States, especially to develop the research, production and use of nuclear energy, as well as the right to participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material and technology for peaceful purposes, without discrimination and in conformity with their respective safeguards agreements, as enshrined under article IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">With regard to cooperation concerning the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Malaysia is one of those countries that has greatly benefited from the IAEA's Technical Assistance and Cooperation Programme. Initially a Programme recipient, Malaysia is now providing experts for IAEA missions to other developing countries under the Programme. In addition, we are an active supporter of the Programme, particularly in terms of hosting various IAEA conferences, seminars, workshops, meetings and regional training courses, as well as training Agency fellows. A substantial amount of the local organizational costs are absorbed by the Government of Malaysia. We do this because we see much value in the Programme, particularly for developing Member States, in developing nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">Despite our commitment to the Programme, we are somewhat disappointed that at times we are unable to secure places for our scientists and engineers to be trained in the nuclear field in countries with more highly developed nuclear technology and programmes. This could be attributed to a tightened control regime by those countries on the transfer of nuclear and nuclear-related material, equipment and technologies.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">While appreciating the concerns of those countries with more advanced nuclear sectors, Malaysia wishes to reaffirm that our intention in seeking to develop indigenous expertise in peaceful uses of nuclear technology, in line with our non-proliferation and safeguards commitments under the NPT, is with a view to further contributing to the Agency's Technical Assistance and Cooperation regime. Malaysia therefore urges the IAEA to look into this matter with a view to finding a way forward on the issue.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Having forsworn nuclear weapons, Malaysia is of the view that developing non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the NPT deserve to be accorded preferential treatment in terms of access to nuclear equipment, material and technology for peaceful civilian uses over States not parties, whether through the IAEA Technical Assistance and Cooperation Programme or through bilateral arrangements.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">We are now witnessing increased interest in nuclear energy as an alternative source of energy. Currently, among the developing countries, particularly in Asia, there is a strong interest in harnessing nuclear power for meeting future energy needs. As indicated in the IAEA report, 15 out of the 30 nuclear reactors currently being constructed in developing countries are located in Asia.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The three factors fuelling this interest, as identified by the Director-General in his statement to the fifty-first regular session of the IAEA General Conference, on 17 September 2007, are the steady growth in energy demand, the increasing concerns about energy security and the challenge of climate change. Malaysia shares that view. Currently, Malaysia depends on natural gas resources for over 70 per cent of its power generation. But, as a rapidly developing country, it will need to keep its future energy options open.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">In this connection, Malaysia maintains a keen interest in any possible progress in the development of equitable multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. Malaysia is of the view that such arrangements regarding the nuclear fuel cycle would be beneficial to developing countries in the long term, especially in cases where those countries would need to eventually embark on a nuclear power programme to help meet future energy demands. In that context, Malaysia views any such multilateral approach as a means of minimizing the investment costs required for any country to embark on nuclear power generation to help meet its future energy demand, while also guaranteeing supplies.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">Malaysia is also of the view that a temporary voluntary waiver of such rights as a precondition for participation in any such multilateral approach could be considered. We wish to emphasize, however, that the application of such a waiver should be effective only for the duration of the multilateral arrangement. Furthermore, such a waiver should also be paired with an assurance of continued supply to the relevant nuclear fuel cycle services and material, as well as with appropriate guarantees, including guaranteed financial and other relevant compensation for failure of supply for reasons other than violation or breach of nuclear non-proliferation commitments.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa11">That notwithstanding, Malaysia also firmly believes that any multilateral approach to the nuclear fuel cycle should not adversely affect the fundamental inalienable rights of the NPT States parties to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, either by imposing a mandatory permanent suspension of any part of such rights as a precondition for participation by any NPT State Party in any such multilateral approach, or otherwise.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa12">Notwithstanding Malaysia's support for moves towards improving the assurances of supply in the field of nuclear power generation technology, which in our view would significantly contribute towards reducing the risks of the further proliferation of sensitive technologies, such moves should also not distract global attention away from the obligation of nuclear-weapon States to undertake to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa13">Despite the overwhelming attention and emphasis placed on ensuring nuclear non-proliferation, Malaysia remains firmly convinced that the pursuit of general, complete and irreversible nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control is the most effective way of removing the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation, and that the total elimination of such weapons remains the only guarantee against their use or the threat of their use.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa14">In the context of pursuing the aim of total elimination of nuclear weapons, Malaysia remains concerned that a majority of the nuclear-weapon States have yet to conclude the Protocol to the Treaty on the South-East Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone. In this regard, we welcome China's readiness to accede to the Protocol, and call upon the remaining nuclear-weapon States to consider acceding to the Protocol at the earliest opportunity. On a related note, we welcome the establishment of the nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia as the first such zone to be established in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa15">Malaysia also wishes to call for the prompt establishment of a similar nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-487(1981).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 487 (1981)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991).pdf" class="pdf">687 (1991)</a>, and relevant General Assembly resolutions adopted by consensus. Malaysia also calls on Israel to accede to the NPT and promptly place all of its nuclear facilities under IAEA full-scope safeguards, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-487(1981).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 487 (1981)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa16">On the implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia reiterates its recognition of the IAEA as the sole competent authority for the verification of the safeguards obligations of that country as well of other member States. Malaysia believes that Iran's willingness to allow continuous IAEA inspection and verification of its nuclear facilities will help in gaining the trust and in building the confidence of the international community in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. In this regard, Malaysia welcomes the positive developments concerning Iran's cooperation with the IAEA and hopes that all outstanding questions over the Iranian nuclear programme can be resolved in an amicable and mutually agreeable manner.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa17">Similarly, Malaysia welcomes the positive actions taken on the part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, particularly its decision to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility and in allowing IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear facilities, pursuant to the 13 February agreement. Malaysia views such actions as significant confidence-building measures that could contribute towards efforts aimed at achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Malaysia remains convinced of the value of the Six-Party Talks process, particularly in terms of reaching a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nuclear issue, and we hope that all concerned parties will continue to remain committed to the process.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa18">In conclusion, Malaysia would like to express once again its appreciation to Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, as well as to the IAEA secretariat for their significant and valuable work in upholding the three pillars of the Agency's mandate -- namely, nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pramudwinai</span> <span class="nation">Thailand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">At the outset, my delegation wishes to congratulate the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on its fiftieth anniversary this year and for its achievements, notably the progress made on the workplan with Iran and the monitoring, verification and disablement of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We strongly encourage and support Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to continue their cooperation with the IAEA in order to maintain the momentum of creating an environment conducive to peace and prosperity in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Thailand also wishes to express its support for the broadening of the IAEA's mandate in promoting and regulating the peaceful uses of nuclear power for development. Thailand stands ready to work with the IAEA in improving nuclear safety and security towards the objective of nuclear non-proliferation through effective safeguards and verification measures. In this connection, we welcome the IAEA's five new members, and the 11 incoming members of the Agency's Board of Governors.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Thailand notes with satisfaction the IAEA's 2006 Annual Report, in particular the new initiatives and implementation of nuclear application programmes in various fields. In our view, nuclear technology applications constitute an area where the constructive role of the IAEA in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear power deserves more emphasis and active support.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">As the fifty-eighth member of the IAEA and one of its founding members -- since 1957 -- and current member of the Board of Governors for the term 2006-2008, Thailand fully complies with the Agency's rules and regulations and with all relevant codes of conduct on the safety and security of radioactive sources. We welcome the keynote address by Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the IAEA's Director General, at the Sixth Congress on Science and Technology for Development in Thailand on 16 July 2007, where the role of nuclear power as an engine for development was underscored. In particular, we fully support the view that the role of nuclear energy in relation to sustainable development needs to be re-evaluated in the context of emerging and interrelated issues -- namely, energy security and climate change.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">As a State party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Thailand recognizes and supports the inalienable right of all States to develop, research, produce and utilize nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, without discrimination, under the NPT. Acknowledging the symbiotic linkage between energy, security and development, and the exigencies of climate change resulting from the use of fossil fuels, Thailand considers nuclear power to be one of the sources of viable alternative energy options and therefore welcomes the reassessment of its role in sustainable development in accordance with both Agenda 21 and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">As there is a need to diversify energy sources and to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, Thailand looks to nuclear energy. In July of this year, Thailand announced its plan to develop nuclear energy under the National Power Development Plan for the next 14 years, in which nuclear-powered electricity generation is envisaged by 2021. The Office of Atoms for Peace of Thailand, as the national regulatory body, together with Thailand's Institute of Nuclear Technology and the National Energy Policy Council, as the operational and policymaking bodies, respectively, have already commenced work with the IAEA on issues relating to the necessary educational, industrial, legal, and institutional instruments. Thailand's Nuclear Power Infrastructure Preparatory Committee has also already been set up.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Thailand further welcomes the IAEA's active role in applying nuclear technology for other development purposes, especially in the fields of medicine, food and agriculture, environmental management and industry. Thailand thus encourages countries to work with the IAEA in reporting their progress in fulfilling international obligations regarding the peaceful use of nuclear energy and in strengthening the implementation of safeguards systems.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">The report, which outlines programmes and activities undertaken by the IAEA in conjunction with its member States, provides encouraging signs that the Agency is taking the right approach in supporting the rights of its members to utilize nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and in strengthening its legal and institutional role in safety and verification regimes.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">With regard to strategies on non-proliferation issues, Thailand welcomes the IAEA's efforts to explore multilateral mechanisms to ensure reliable supply of and access to fuel cycle services for States that choose not to acquire full fuel cycle capabilities.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">Regarding the Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF), Thailand applauds the important role the TCF has been playing in strengthening technology transfer and promoting scientific and technological cooperation in areas such as basic human needs and sustainable development. Nevertheless, additional emphasis must be given to how the Fund could be used and managed more effectively without sacrificing the benefits of nuclear technology to Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa11">Finally, Thailand reiterates its support for the indispensable role of the IAEA in nuclear technology, safety and verification for the peace and prosperity of its member States and the international community. Thailand commends the IAEA for its integrity, impartiality and professionalism in promoting and ensuring the peaceful uses of nuclear energy for development, and hence its competence and central role as part of the disarmament and non-proliferation agenda.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Mladineo</span> <span class="nation">Croatia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Croatia has aligned itself with the statement made by the representative of Portugal on behalf of the European Union. I shall therefore limit my remarks to a few issues of particular interest to my country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">At the outset, let me stress that, following last year's election to the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Governor from Croatia was elected Vice-Chairman of the Board this September. This result confirms our readiness to play a constructive part in IAEA activities. Moreover, it demonstrates Croatia's appreciation of the Agency's unique contribution to peace, security and development in the world at this difficult and critical time for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Let me also express Croatia's appreciation for the Agency's comprehensive annual report. I would like to thank the Director General, Mr. ElBaradei, for presenting the report this morning. Croatia fully supports its substance and is again pleased to be among the sponsors of the draft resolution on the report.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">Croatia commends the Agency for the successful continuation of its wide-ranging activities in the fields of technology, safety and verification. We particularly support efforts to continuously upgrade and develop the Agency's concepts and means to effectively address dangerous new trends in nuclear proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">The Agency was established 50 years ago to promote safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies. In this regard, Croatia reiterates that comprehensive safeguards agreements together with the Additional Protocols constitute the current IAEA verification standard. Achieving the universal application of a strengthened safeguards system is an urgent priority, and the fact that more than 100 countries have yet to bring into force their additional protocols is a cause of great concern. At the same time, there is a parallel need to increase the Agency's verification resources to enable it to deal effectively with growing verification demands.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">Croatia supports the Agency's activities in the area of strengthening national capacities in order to prevent proliferation and increase nuclear security. National measures should include improvement of export and import controls, strengthening of border controls, re-evaluation of legislative frameworks, more frequent exchanges of relevant information at the national and international levels, and the improvement of public awareness on the issue of proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">Croatia signed and ratified the Additional Protocol, the amendment to article VI of the IAEA statute and the amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. Croatia also supports the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the supplementary guidance on the import and export of radioactive sources.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">One of the most beneficial aspects of successful cooperation between Croatia and the Agency has been within the framework of its technical cooperation programme, where the Agency supports five ongoing projects in Croatia, together with its contributions to and co-organization of workshops and seminars hosted by Croatia, addressing issues of non-proliferation, radiation protection and the fight against trafficking and potential threats by terrorists against the security of nuclear and radioactive material.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">In that context, we are also pleased to have strengthened our role in the region, bearing in mind the importance of coordinated and effective regional measures aimed at maximizing the peaceful use of nuclear energy and confronting the growing risks of proliferation and nuclear terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">As the role of the Agency continues to expand, the challenges it faces remain important and difficult. The annual report makes it perfectly clear that these challenges can be addressed only by partnering with its stakeholders: member States, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, national counterparts and the public. Croatia pledges its unequivocal commitment to that partnership as we move along the path towards sustainable non-proliferation and genuine "atoms for peace".</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rachkov</span> <span class="nation">Belarus</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">This year, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary. In its 50 years of existence, the Agency has acquired exclusive status as the leading international body capable of dealing with the question of the safe use of nuclear power for peaceful purposes and for ensuring effective control over the implementation of international obligations relating to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">States members of the Agency and its secretariat are doing truly colossal work. As part of its technical cooperation programme, the IAEA is providing interested member States with multifaceted assistance in making use of cutting-edge nuclear technology. Very careful work is being done to ensure a global system of nuclear and radiological security. An action plan to combat nuclear terrorism is being carried out. Measures are being taken to enhance the physical protection of nuclear and radioactive materials. Consistent steps are being taken to ensure the universalization of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and to enhance the effectiveness of the IAEA safeguards system. Work is also being done to protect nuclear knowledge and train nuclear specialists.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Belarus has been actively promoting the implementation of all of these activities in the work of IAEA. Our country is fully behind the activities of the agency in its work towards achieving the IAEA slogan, "Atoms for peace". We believe that all of the machinery available in the Agency should be used to the maximum extent possible in order to achieve those aims. We consider the machinery for technical cooperation within IAEA today as the most important instrument for transmitting and implementing up-to-date nuclear ideas, technology and experience.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The implementation of technical cooperation projects by the Agency in Belarus have provided considerable assistance to national efforts in a number of areas relating to the possible use of nuclear know-how and technology. Moreover, Belarus suffered the full brunt of the Chernobyl tragedy, and the success of mutual assistance as part of its cooperation with IAEA has made it possible to implement a number of socio-economic and medical measures that have allowed for the rehabilitation of the damaged regions and have ensured their sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">At this stage of its existence, IAEA is particularly important in terms of cooperation with member States that are interested in setting up their own nuclear power programmes. We are pleased to note that IAEA activities along those lines are becoming more systematic in nature. That is particularly important given the increasing number of Governments that have announced their intentions to implement national programmes to develop nuclear power, including projects to construct nuclear power stations on their territory. In that context, a very promising area of work for the Agency is its evaluation of new approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle to ensure guaranteed supplies of nuclear fuel to interested consumers.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">Belarus is a convinced and consistent supporter of enhancing and ensuring the universalization of the non-proliferation regime, and we have unfailingly discharged our obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the safeguards agreements. We are aware of the complexity and the multifaceted nature of the implementation of the NPT, but we nonetheless do believe that cooperation under that Treaty should lead to positive experiences in implementing all of its provisions, including the IAEA safeguards agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">In that connection, any country that discharges its obligations under the NPT should have unimpeded access to the development of its nuclear power.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">The delegation of Belarus is pleased to note that the IAEA resolution on strengthening the Agency's activities in the field of technical cooperation reflects the value of the Agency's contribution to international efforts in overcoming the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. The Government of Belarus intends to continue to create favourable conditions for the Agency in its work to mitigate the consequences of the catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. We call on all member States of the Agency to support IAEA activities in that very important area.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank Mr. ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for presenting the annual report of the Agency. Pakistan appreciates the role played by IAEA in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the diverse areas of power generation, health and medicine, agriculture, hydrology, industry, environment and basic sciences. We assure Mr. ElBaradei and his colleagues of our full support and cooperation in achieving progress and prosperity for all.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">IAEA has completed five decades working as a successful organization. Its role as the world's focal point in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy assumes greater significance in view of the rapidly growing global energy demand and shortage of fossil fuel reserves, as well as the diverse challenges of the environment and proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">The Agency's report for 2006 underscores the key role of nuclear power in enhancing the security of energy supply while also mitigating the discharge of carbon into the atmosphere. The Agency can make a significant contribution to meeting the needs and challenges of the twenty-first century by ensuring equitable access to nuclear materials, technology and equipment for peaceful purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">Pakistan attaches the highest importance to the technical cooperation programme of the IAEA. We have benefited from and contributed to the technical cooperation programme.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">Pakistan was one of the earliest countries to launch a programme of nuclear power generation and have developed the entire range of nuclear fuel cycle facilities. Parallel to the development of the nuclear fuel cycle, I would briefly draw attention to our achievements in other sectors.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">In the area of nuclear research, the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology has emerged as a major research institution in the region for basic and applied research in the fields of nuclear physics, nuclear chemistry, nuclear materials, nuclear engineering, radioisotope production and applications.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission is playing a vital role in the application of nuclear science and technology in the human health sector. The Commission has so far established 13 nuclear medicine and oncology centres and institutions throughout the country for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The PAEC is also collaborating with international agencies such as the IAEA, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the International Union Against Cancer, the World Health Organization and others in technical cooperation projects, providing training for technical human resource development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">The PAEC has been playing a major role in harnessing nuclear techniques in agriculture and other biological research since its inception. Our National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering is a centre dedicated to the application of biotechnology in agriculture, industry, health and environment. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission has also established research laboratories in the fields of isotope hydrology and isotope ecology.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">With a sizeable civilian nuclear programme and decades of experience in nuclear operations in the areas of power generation, health, medicine, agriculture, biotechnology and industrial applications, Pakistan is uniquely placed to offer cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy to developing countries under IAEA safeguards. We look forward to further strengthening our participation in the IAEA's promotional activities.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">Since the foundation of the atomic energy programme, Pakistan has always recognized that nuclear safety and security in the national and international context is a vital objective. We have therefore established strong safety and security infrastructure, including a strong and independent Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA). Pakistan is a party to the Nuclear Safety Convention, the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and other relevant IAEA instruments. Nuclear safety arrangements at civilian facilities in Pakistan are subjected to peer reviews and regular inspections by IAEA missions. On the security side, the PNRA requires all operators to implement the security arrangements as contained in IAEA document INFCIRC-225-Rev.4, which constitutes the current international standard in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa11">The PNRA is implementing a National Nuclear Security Action Plan which aims at, first, strengthening the security of nuclear and radioactive materials and facilities containing such materials; secondly, prevention and detection of illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials; and, thirdly, responding to incidents of illicit trafficking and emergencies. The PNRA is cooperating with the IAEA for capacity-building in this context.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa12">Pakistan's economy has expanded at an average annual growth rate of 7 per cent from 2002 to 2007. Electricity demand increased at 8 per cent per annum. At the current rate of growth, the demand for electricity would increase from 20,000 megawatts at present to 163,000 megawatts by 2030.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa13">Pakistan's indigenous energy resources are limited. The Government of Pakistan has therefore launched a 25-year Energy Security Plan to cater for the rising demand for energy. The strategy for the development of the power sector is maximum utilization of indigenous energy resources to reduce dependence on imported fuels. Nuclear power generation will be an indispensable element in our national energy security strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa14">This Energy Security Plan envisages increase in nuclear power generation capacity from the present 425 megawatts to 8,800 megawatts by the year 2030, representing an increase in the proportion of energy that nuclear electricity generation will supply from the 0.8 per cent to 4.2 per cent. This will entail setting up several additional nuclear power reactors.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa15">To support the planned expansion of nuclear power in Pakistan, we have embarked upon the establishment of a uranium conversion and enrichment facility that will cater for the needs for fuel of our nuclear power plants. At the last IAEA General Conference, Pakistan made an announcement concerning the possibility of placing this facility under IAEA safeguards. This voluntary measure would be facilitated through Pakistan's non-discriminatory integration into the international arrangements for peaceful nuclear cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa16">Pakistan has been closely following recent proposals and initiatives on assurances of supply of nuclear fuel. The basis of acceptance of any such mechanism will be that of trust in the system. It should encourage expansion of nuclear power through the assured supply of nuclear fuel and other related services in a non-discriminatory manner. Above all, consistent with the existing realities, any such mechanism should include all States with advanced fuel cycle capabilities, without discrimination. In particular, the report of the Expert Group established by the Director General of the IAEA emphasizes the need to make the three non-NPT States partners of the multilateral nuclear fuel cycle approach. It also envisages the establishment of nuclear parks in countries under IAEA supervision.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa17">Pakistan recognizes the important role played by the IAEA verification regime. We have fully complied with our obligations pursuant to our safeguards agreements with the IAEA. We share the view that all States should fully comply with their safeguards obligations and international commitments. The most important step towards maintaining the credibility of the safeguards regime is the fulfilment of their legal obligations by all States. A balance between the Agency's regulatory, promotional and safety functions will ensure the continuing relevance of the Agency in the twenty-first century in the context of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy as well as non-proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa18">In conclusion, let me say that the international community has well recognized and commended the vital role that Director General ElBaradei and the IAEA are playing in the promotion of peaceful nuclear cooperation and non-proliferation. Mr. ElBaradei's remarks regarding several current issues deserve close consideration by all the concerned parties.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa19">There is a disconnect, however, between the call of some for full-scope safeguards and the additional protocol as the standard for peaceful nuclear cooperation, and their simultaneous readiness to consider selective exceptions from such standards. Pakistan supports the Director General's call for a new framework for the use of nuclear energy that responds to "the lessons we have learned and the current reality" (<a href="../html/A-62-PV.36.html">A/62/PV.36</a>). And this will have to be done on a non-discriminatory basis. We also welcome the recognition of the linkage between non-proliferation and disarmament. For its part, for the past several years, Pakistan has called for evolving a new consensus on disarmament and non-proliferation which would encompass the new framework for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We hope that the Secretary-General will consider convening an international conference or a special session of the General Assembly to help in evolving such a new consensus.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Mohamed-Noor</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">My delegation would first like to thank the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, for his comprehensive report. The IAEA continues to do excellent work, despite the challenges it faces. That is testimony to the skill and leadership of its Director General. We believe that the IAEA should continue to be the global focal point for nuclear cooperation, in line with its three pillars of technology, safety and security and verification.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Last year, we were focused on nuclear developments in Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This year, we welcome the closure of the Yongbyon nuclear facility in the latter country, as verified by the IAEA, and the return of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the Six-Party Talks. Continuing cooperation between the IAEA and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will lead to enhanced security in the Korean peninsula. In tandem, we hope that Iran will also continue to cooperate with the IAEA in building confidence and resolving the outstanding questions pertaining to its nuclear programme.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">The Asia-Pacific region's demand for energy has increased with its rapid economic development. This demand can only become more pronounced in the future. At present, fossil fuels meet most of Asia's energy needs. The question going forward is whether this situation can continue. Fossil fuels are finite and not always easy to extract; high oil prices are one manifestation of this. There are also concerns about the pollutive effects of fossil fuels and how fossil fuel emissions contribute to climate change. With these concerns in mind, it is no surprise that many countries are exploring alternative sources of energy that may be cleaner and more stable in terms of price and long-term availability. In short, many countries are looking at nuclear power.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), States have the sovereign right to use nuclear energy for peaceful means. However, countries that explore the nuclear energy option also have a grave responsibility to carefully consider safety issues. Accidents involving nuclear facilities have horrible effects that range over great distances and manifest themselves over a very lengthy period of time. One need only hark back to the Chernobyl tragedy of more than 20 years ago. Just this year, there was a fire and a leak at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant when an earthquake struck Niigata province in Japan.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">States newly considering nuclear power should also adopt measures to assuage concerns about safety and security issues. The IAEA's Department of Nuclear Safety and Security has a pivotal role to play in helping these countries achieve the necessary safety standards. The IAEA can help States build capacity regarding safety and security issues associated with the use of nuclear energy. We fully support the Department's objective of a strong, sustainable and visible global safety regime that provides for the protection of people and the environment from the effects of ionizing radiation, for the minimization of the likelihood of accidents or malicious acts that could endanger life and property and for the effective mitigation of the effects of any such incidents. In this regard, we welcome the IAEA's activities to build, strengthen and maintain national and regional capacities for using nuclear technology in a safe, secure and sustainable manner, and we encourage the IAEA to continue these activities.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">The IAEA should also continue its technical cooperation with relevant countries and explore more partnerships and cooperation with other players in the nuclear energy market. States should draw on the IAEA's expertise in these areas.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">Singapore supports the IAEA's objective of providing authoritative guidance and advice on nuclear safety approaches, policies and principles. To this end, IAEA's safety standards are of paramount importance and provide a widely accepted basis for nuclear safety. States considering nuclear power should look towards these international standards in setting their own guidelines and should build on the IAEA's framework when developing nuclear safety regimes. Singapore thus welcomes the IAEA's efforts to extend its safety and security standards and best practices throughout the world.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">We support the introduction of a new IAEA safety review initiative, the Integrated Regulatory Review Service, the adoption of the Fundamental Safety Principles by the IAEA Board of Governors, and the continuation of the IAEA's peer review mechanism. These initiatives will help countries and regional organizations build up a body of standards, knowledge and expertise on nuclear safety issues.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">Importantly, the effectiveness of the IAEA necessarily depends in large part on cooperation from States. States should continue to work, in cooperation with the IAEA, on creating a culture of safety among nuclear regulators, operators and employees. Regional safety and security regimes under the auspices of the IAEA, such as the Asian Nuclear Safety Network, are useful in building up State capacity based on the IAEA's safety protocols and standards.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">Within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we also recognize the IAEA's role and expertise in the area of safety. The plan of action that was adopted by ASEAN Foreign Ministers in July to implement the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone, for instance, calls for ASEAN to work with the IAEA and other partners in developing a legal framework to meet international standards on nuclear safety. ASEAN energy ministers, at their annual meeting in Singapore on 23 August 2007, also endorsed in principle the establishment of a nuclear energy safety subsector network to discuss nuclear safety issues.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">These developments go hand in hand with efforts to look for alternative, carbon-free and sustainable energy sources. In this regard, ASEAN looks forward to working closely with the IAEA in developing a regional framework of collaboration and cooperation, as well as adopting the best practices in this field. We believe this is timely, as more South-East Asian countries have either indicated an interest in or are pursuing nuclear energy programmes, in line with increasing energy needs. We believe that, for their part, companies involved in the provision of nuclear energy plants must also help ensure that nuclear power plants meet the highest safety standards. This includes issues such as location and design, the management and disposal of spent nuclear fuel and human capacity to run the plants properly.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">The IAEA's role in building confidence about the safety and security aspects of nuclear energy is crucial. Nuclear energy is obviously an option for States considering alternative sources of energy. But those same States must ensure that this energy can be sourced safely. Cooperation with the IAEA in developing their nuclear power is essential for those States' -- and, indeed, the wider regions' -- safety and security. It would be tragic if nuclear energy became the source of future problems. Singapore believes that the IAEA can continue to do good work in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa13">Singapore will continue to support the IAEA's mission and activities in the future.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kryzhanivskyi</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">Ukraine has aligned itself with the statement made by the representative of Portugal on behalf of the European Union (EU) and associated countries. Therefore, I shall limit my remarks to a few issues of particular importance to my country.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">At the outset, on behalf of the Government of Ukraine, I would like to congratulate the new States members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- the Republic of Cape Verde, the Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Burundi, the Kingdom of Bahrain and Nepal -- and to wish them every success in their activities within the Agency. The enlargement of the IAEA's membership is additional evidence of the Agency's growing authority.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">As is known, Ukraine voluntarily renounced what was then the world's third largest nuclear weapons arsenal. That is further evidence that we are a country for which the peaceful use of nuclear energy is one of the fundamental principles of sustainable development for all nations seeking a more secure and predictable environment.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">We share the view that it is necessary to expand the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in a safe and secure manner, with reduced risk of proliferation. That is the idea behind the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, which we joined on l6 September 2007 by signing its Statement of Principles.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">Regarding the Agency's activity in evaluating the worldwide long-term use of nuclear energy, my country attaches special importance to the IAEA's work in studying the options for meeting energy demands. We note and value the initiative of the Agency on the creation of a non-discriminatory mechanism of nuclear fuel supply. We believe that a guaranteed nuclear fuel supply, in conformity with the principle of nuclear non-proliferation and under the Agency's auspices, will be essential in improving the energy independence and security of Member States, especially developing ones.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">Since my country suffered the world's worst nuclear accident, at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, we pay special attention to compliance with effective safety standards and to ensuring that these are in accordance with internationally recognized norms. Safety performance indicators at Ukrainian nuclear power plants meet the requirements of national and international norms in this sphere, which was confirmed by Operational Safety Review Team missions to Ukrainian nuclear power plants. Nevertheless, my country continues to upgrade its approaches to nuclear power plant safety improvement. We do this at the national level and in the framework of international cooperation. We also update legislation in the field of nuclear energy use, and we strengthen relevant institutional capabilities of the national regulatory authority.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">It is my pleasure to note that the enhancement of nuclear security, the improvement of nuclear materials and the security of radioactive sources worldwide remain among the Agency's priorities. My country attaches special importance to activity aimed at supporting the Illicit Trafficking Database because it gives an opportunity to assess trends in this sphere for further improvement, development and implementation of measures aimed at securing the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We have actively participated in that programme since 1997, and we call upon all Member States to engage more actively in exchanges of information with the Database.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">My country considers the Comprehensive Safeguards System as an important tool to ensure the absence of undeclared activities and of the diversion of related nuclear materials. We are confident that the safeguards agreements, together with additional protocols, should constitute the IAEA verification standard. Ukraine encourages all States that still have not done so to sign, ratify and implement comprehensive safeguards agreements without further delay.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">My country fulfils its international obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Additional Protocol on safeguards between Ukraine and the IAEA. I would like to take this opportunity to once again express our gratitude to the Agency for its assistance in implementing the Additional Protocol in Ukraine.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa10">We reaffirm our position that achievement of the universality of the safeguards system must be considered a priority task by the Agency. The IAEA must devote special attention to safeguards implementation in countries striving to develop nuclear activities.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa11">It is well known that the issues of the mitigation of consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and the transformation of the shelter object at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant into an environmentally sound system remain among the priorities for Ukraine.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa12">I am pleased to inform the General Assembly that in September the contracts in the construction of a new safe confinement over the shelter and of an interim spent fuel storage facility for the Chernobyl site were signed in Kyiv. We appreciate highly the efforts of all the countries involved, contributors and donors to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and the Nuclear Safety Account of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for their valuable contributions that made the conclusion of those contracts possible. We are convinced that the implementation of the contracts will be crucial for overcoming the consequences of Chernobyl, and we call upon all parties concerned to further foster this process.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa13">Ukraine welcomes the long-standing partnership with the IAEA in the implementation of radiological support for the rehabilitation of the Chernobyl-affected areas. We particularly welcome the efforts of the Agency to enhance the radiation safety of the local communities in the Chernobyl area, to improve the long-term strategy of radiological monitoring and to disseminate information.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa14">During this General Assembly session, we will submit a draft resolution on the strengthening of international cooperation to mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. We shall look forward to its adoption by consensus next month. In the spirit of solidarity, we kindly invite other Member States to join in sponsoring that document.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa15">Ukraine shares the concerns regarding new threats of nuclear terrorism. Therefore, we welcome the development of effective measures aimed at preventing the acquisition by terrorists of nuclear and radiological weapons and the means of their delivery in the framework of initiatives on the suppression of nuclear terrorism, as well as other international and regional programmes in this field. At this point, we note with satisfaction the entry into force in July 2007 of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa16">In conclusion, I would like to echo the words of support expressed earlier regarding the report of the IAEA, and to note again our appreciation for the activities of the IAEA Director General, Mr. ElBaradei, as well as for those of the Agency's secretariat, in strengthening international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Ukraine will continue to participate actively in the Agency's activities in order to help to fulfil this important mission.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa17">Ukraine fully supports the draft resolution entitled "Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency" (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.5.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.5</a>).</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Aitimova</span> <span class="nation">Kazakhstan</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">First of all, I would like to join other delegations in thanking Director General Mohamed ElBaradei for his presentation of the annual report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">As a member of the IAEA, Kazakhstan takes effective measures to meet its obligations in strengthening the non-proliferation regime, as well as in implementing the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement. By renouncing our possession of the world's fourth-largest nuclear arsenal, we again confirmed our country's devotion to implementing its international obligations. We have established and are consistently improving a system to combat the illicit transfer of nuclear material and technology. At the same time, we call for careful reflection on the introduction of new limits to the transfer of nuclear technologies so as not to create unjustified barriers to the peaceful use of nuclear power.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">We in Kazakhstan are working, with IAEA assistance, to implement the provisions of the new version of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">In the town of Kurchatov, we have started work on a nuclear technology park, which will be a basis for the development of peaceful applications of nuclear power, including the development of nuclear power in our country. We have begun operating a heavy ion accelerator and are continuing the construction of a Kazakh research tokomak. We are also designing a major nuclear medicine centre.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">Kazakhstan has the second largest uranium deposits in the world, and we clearly understand the importance and responsibility of not using uranium for any purposes other than peaceful ones. This year, Kazakhstan signed an intergovernmental agreement with Russia on the creation of an international uranium enrichment centre in Angarsk. My colleague, the representative of the Russian Federation, alluded to this earlier today (see <a href="../html/A-62-PV.36.html">A/62/PV.36</a>). We believe that the creation of a multinational centre for uranium enrichment would make it possible to ensure reliable uranium fuel, while at the same time deferring the proliferation of sensitive technology from the civilian nuclear fuel cycle. We are an active participant in the process of strengthening the non-proliferation regime, both worldwide and in the Central Asian region.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">Kazakhstan recognizes the right of each country to develop peaceful nuclear technology. We must find ways to resolve the conflict situations that have arisen recently. These ways should not infringe on the right of countries to technological development or their access to knowledge and should restore the confidence of the international community with regard to peaceful nuclear activity. This is certainly a very complex task, but the experience of the IAEA and of its Director General with his firm and principled position makes it possible for us to hope for a successful resolution to this problem.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">We need to improve the monitoring system regarding a whole range of problems relating to nuclear weapons and technology while at the same time ensuring that the nuclear atom is used for exclusively peaceful purposes, not for military purposes. We feel that it is logical to create, under the auspices of the IAEA, mechanisms, including international centres, to ensure a reliable fuel supply for nuclear power stations and to manage the secure storage and reprocessing of waste at particularly sensitive stages of the fuel cycle.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa08">It is clear that we will need to resolve political, commercial and financial questions to do this and it is possible that such proposals may seem somewhat unrealistic today, but I think we have to start moving along these lines. We do support the IAEA report and note the statement made today by the Director General and his initiative for new approaches to the peaceful use of nuclear power. We believe that, once they have been thoroughly discussed, we could agree on general guidelines for developing innovative nuclear technology.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, we would like to express again our firm support for the activities of the IAEA, and we assure you that Kazakhstan will continue to consistently live up to its reputation as a responsible international partner in this area. As is our custom, Kazakhstan is one of the sponsors of the resolution to be adopted today by the General Assembly on the IAEA.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Abdallah</span> <span class="nation">Sudan</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">I would like to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly and wish him every success in his lofty post. We would also like to express our appreciation and thanks to Mr. ElBaradei, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his comprehensive report to the General Assembly. This report reviews the action and plans of the IAEA with regard to the transfer of technology for peaceful purposes, the preservation of the international nuclear security regime and the strengthening of the security of nuclear installations. This stresses the growing role of the IAEA, particularly in the area of cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy and for development.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">My delegation welcomes the draft resolution presented by Chile on the report of the IAEA for 2006. We support this draft resolution, in conformity with the African Group's position as expressed to the General Assembly by the representative of Benin. On behalf of the delegation of Sudan, it is a great pleasure to welcome the representative of Chile and to congratulate him on his election as Head of the Board of Governors. We highly appreciate the efforts of the IAEA in the area of cooperation with various scientific bodies to improve agricultural crops and their characteristics, as well as to develop vaccines, a nuclear medicine programme, particularly in medicines used in the fight against cancer, one of the deadliest diseases of our time.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa03">My delegation reaffirms the right of States, without any discrimination, to undertake research and produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in accordance with international conventions. We call on States to preserve the credibility of the IAEA and its vital role by refraining from exerting pressure on the Agency or from interfering with its activities. In this context, we ask that justice and equity be respected in dealing with certain States, through dialogue and negotiations, so as to come to suitable solutions in accordance with international agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa04">The delegation of the Sudan reaffirms its established position to support the aspirations of all geographical regions to make their regions free from nuclear weapons, on the basis of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which is one of the main pillars of international peace and security. The Middle East region is still a long way away from achieving this goal. For decades now, Israel, the only State in the region to possess nuclear weapons, is opposed to such initiatives and refuses to sign the NPT and its Additional Protocol, despite the appeals and repeated calls of the international community to that effect. Israel's accession to the Treaty and its Protocol is the only way to put an end to tensions in the region and to open the path to peace for everyone. Declaring the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone remains the best way to reinforce regional security and to maintain international peace.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa05">Helping developing countries to develop their national legislation will complete the work of the IAEA in implementing the programmes and plans for technical cooperation. We hope that cooperation will be promoted within the framework of the Agency's health programmes in order to activate and support regional and continental projects in the fight against mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the disease that kills most people in Africa, so that our continent can implement its economic and social development programmes. We highly appreciate the work of the IAEA on the African continent and we hope that the Agency's budget will be increased so that it can fight poverty and diseases and support nuclear treatment institutions, on the African continent.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is, in essence, an issue directly linked to the end of the hostile policy of the United States and its nuclear threat against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. A peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiations is our consistent policy. This is well proved by our efforts dedicated to the hard process of resolving the issue since the early 1990s. Our ultimate goal, with regard to the nuclear issue, is the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">The 19 September 2005 Joint Statement and the practical actions taken for its implementation thus far are a clear indication of the unwavering political will of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will continue to implement faithfully its obligations pursuant to the 19 September Joint Statement on the basis of the principle of actions for actions. That requires the United States to take political measures such as removing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the list of States sponsors of terrorism and terminating the obligations of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as they have pledged to do.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">In particular, Japan should do positive things to achieve progress in the ongoing Six-Party Talks, not merely in words but in actions. Japan's call for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1718(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1718 (2006)</a> is nothing but a manifestation of their ulterior intentions to block current progress. No issues will be resolved by sanctions or pressure, as has been proven by history.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">As for the draft resolution before us, with strong reservations on some paragraphs contained in IAEA General Conference resolution <a href="../pdf/GC(51)-RES-16.pdf" class="nolink">GC(51)/RES/16</a>, my delegation wishes to inform the Assembly that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would like to join in the consensus adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.5.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.5</a>, entitled "Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency", with the expectation of continued progress in the six-party talks and a fair approach by the Agency to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Darwish</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa01">Our delegation joined the consensus on the draft resolution entitled "Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency" (<a href="../pdf/A-62-L.5.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/L.5</a>), guided by its belief in the importance of the role of the Agency in monitoring nuclear non-proliferation and guaranteeing the right of all Member States, big and small alike, to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa02">However, our delegation wishes to place on record our disappointment and regret over the double standards exhibited by several States in the various successive conferences of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities and the Israeli nuclear threat. That has resulted in the annual postponement of the discussion of this question, while major international pressure is being brought to bear on other States as they exercise their sovereign right to possess nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa03">In that regard, we recall that this item has remained on the agenda of the IAEA General Conference for over a decade, during which time many resolutions emerged in favour of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone and calling upon Israel to abandon the nuclear option, to subject its nuclear facilities to international inspection and to the safeguards agreement, along with the other States in the region, and to strive to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone that has no place for the policies of nuclear terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa04">We should also mention that we were also disappointed with the failure of the international community to send a clear message to Israel, in which it affirms the importance of good intentions and serious work to implement the principle of nuclear non-proliferation in an equitable and transparent manner, instead of the policy of nuclear hypocrisy practiced by some States which will only lead to greater threats to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa05">Our delegation would like to emphasize that continuous manoeuvring to silence the voice of the truth vis--vis the Israeli nuclear threat and danger to the Middle East will lead to frustration on the part of the States and peoples of the region and will cause a nuclear arms race, the results of which will be the responsibility of the States that are covering up the danger posed by Israeli nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa06">The annual vote which is usually held in the First Committee on the draft resolution entitled "Threat of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East" is clear evidence of the unsound position of those States that have mounted obstacles to the discussion of this item at previous IAEA General Conferences. That is especially true since the seventh preambular paragraph of this year's First Committee draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/AC.1-62-L.2.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.1/62/L.2</a>) refers to concerns about the continued presence of nuclear facilities in the Middle East that are not subject to the safeguards regime. The eighth preambular paragraph of the same draft also notes that Israel remains the only State in the Middle East that is not yet a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa07">Also, operative paragraphs 2 and 3 of the First Committee's draft resolution emphasize the importance of Israel joining, without any delay, the NPT, and having all its nuclear facilities subjected to comprehensive IAEA safeguards. Israel is urged not to develop, produce, test or possess nuclear weapons, but to abandon the possession of such weapons as an important confidence-building measure among all States in the region and a step towards promoting peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk04-pa08">All those demands represent the international and regional will to protect international and regional peace and security from the threat of Israeli nuclear arms.</p>
