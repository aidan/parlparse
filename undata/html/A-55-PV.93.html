	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk07-pa02">My Government is disappointed to note that the list before us today -- at least the copy that we have -- does not accord with that mandate. It does not reflect the full panoply of views on these important questions. I therefore recommend that interested NGOs be allowed to participate provisionally in this week's activities, and that we take up approval of the list when it is complete.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk02-pa01">After some confusion, I can say that the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA), which represents the research-based pharmaceutical companies, has Economic and Social Council status and is, therefore, ex officio, accredited to the whole process. I am sorry that it is not on the list that was submitted to Member States. As the Assembly knows, in addition to those organizations that have Economic and Social Council status, there are some that are members of the Programme Coordinating Board of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and on the list of additional civil society representatives. I hope that the confusion has been clarified.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk06-pa01">I do not want to prolong this discussion, but I would like to express my understanding of the situation. I recall that when, a couple of weeks ago, this list was released and shared in the informal consultations, chaired by your facilitator, Mr. President, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS explained that it had not been able to process all the requests from various non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and that it recommended -- and it was agreed in principle at that time -- that there could be a second exercise -- and a second document issued -- whereby we could approve another group of NGOs. If that is indeed the situation, my delegation would strongly recommend that we proceed to approve this list on the understanding that we will be considering another list at a future point.</div>
