Today is 29 June. On this occasion we commemorate his valuable services to the United Nations and to the cause of peace. We would like to convey to the family of Mr. Beye our remembrance of his services and our gratitude to them for what he did for the United Nations and for all of us.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council calls for an immediate suspension of hostilities in Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council calls on the armed groups to enter into negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its profound concern at the continuation of the conflict in Burundi and its toll on the civilian population. In that context, the Security Council stresses once again its support for the Arusha process and the efforts of the Facilitator, Nelson Mandela.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council strongly emphasizes to the parties to the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement of August 2000 (Arusha Agreement) the need to implement all the immediately applicable provisions of the Agreement, including the provisions for the establishment of new institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council calls upon the parties to the Arusha Agreement to continue searching, together with all parties concerned, for solutions to outstanding issues in the Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council expresses grave concern at continuing human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law, and stresses the need for all parties to ensure respect for human rights and humanitarian law. In particular, it urges the belligerents to commit themselves immediately to the protection of civilians, in particular their life, physical integrity and the means necessary for their survival. It also reiterates its call for safe and unhindered access for the delivery of humanitarian aid to all people in need.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"The Security Council encourages the Secretary-General through his representatives to continue to engage the armed groups and contribute to coordinated efforts to bring about a political settlement of the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">"The Security Council reiterates its call to the donor community to increase its humanitarian and development assistance to the people of Burundi, in keeping with their pledges given at the Paris Donor Conference on 11-12 December 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">"The Security Council remains actively seized of the situation in Burundi, and in this context, will continue to receive regular reporting from the Secretariat on developments in and around the country. The Security Council stands ready to consider, in the light of progress in the above areas, further contributions to the peace process, and the implementation of the Arusha Agreement."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-17.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/17</a>.</p>
