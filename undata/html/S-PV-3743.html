<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), <a href="../pdf/S-1997-115.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/115</a>.

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">The first speaker is the Vice-Minister without Portfolio of Angola, His Excellency General Higino Carneiro, whom I welcome and on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Carneiro</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> <span class="language">Portuguese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my Government, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month; I also congratulate your predecessor on his excellent work last month.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I would like also to convey our appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, even in the short time he has been at the helm of the Organization, has already shown his personal commitment to a speedy settlement of the Angolan problem. His coming trip to Angola will convey the international community's firm support for the peace process and will be a gesture of encouragement to the participants in that process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The current deliberations on Angola are taking place at a time of increasing tension in Africa, particularly in the Great Lakes region. This is mobilizing the attention and the efforts of the members of the Security Council, with the goal of ending hostilities and thus preventing a new escalation of violence on the continent.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Two years ago, when the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-976(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 976 (1995)</a> authorizing the establishment of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), there were many pessimistic voices predicting that a return to war was only a matter of time, and saying that this peace operation was doomed to failure. However, time and events have proved the opposite, and this leads us to believe that the path to peace seems irreversible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Since its signing in 1994, the Lusaka Protocol has substantially altered the situation in Angola. Angola is experiencing its longest period without war since it was established as an independent nation. The advances made since the beginning of the implementation of the Protocol are obvious. But obviously, more advances could have been made, especially as regards national reconciliation, had UNITA assumed a more constructive attitude throughout this period of implementation of the Lusaka Protocol.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The advances in the peace process to date would not have been possible without action by the international community and, in particular, by the Security Council, which has employed various means of pressure, including, in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a>, enforcement measures against UNITA; these have proved effective in gaining compliance with many provisions of the accords.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">Exerting further pressure upon UNITA continues to be necessary because of the excessive delays in the application of the Lusaka accord, caused by obstacles systematically raised by UNITA. An illustration of this situation is that the establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation and the swearing in of UNITA deputies to the parliament did not occur on the dates agreed upon solely because UNITA decided not to send its representatives to Luanda as agreed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">The new elements by which UNITA is now attempting to place conditions on its participation in the Government and in the parliament run counter to the spirit and letter of the Lusaka Protocol; their acceptance would mean the renegotiation of that accord. We reiterate that the formation of the Government and the swearing in of members of parliament should take place unconditionally, without any linkages, and within the legal framework defined by the accords and other agreements that are valid for the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Another important goal of the process that has yet to be achieved is the expansion of the State's central administration in areas occupied by UNITA. Although there has been some progress in this regard, the failure to complete the process is entirely the responsibility of UNITA. Moreover, UNITA continues to impede free movement of people and goods in those areas.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">Prompt completion of the pending tasks under the peace accord is crucial. If the accord is not to become fragile, the peace process cannot be allowed to drag on indefinitely. It should not be dependent upon wills that are not those of the Angolan people and not in the nation's interests; the Angolan people have always been the war's main victims and continue to be the victims of its consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">UNITA must be clear about its intentions. It must cease raising new obstacles and must show in practical deeds if it is in fact motivated by good faith and political will. The systematic way in which UNITA invokes arguments in order not to honour its commitments leads us to believe that we are facing delaying tactics aimed at blocking the country's normal functioning, creating an untenable situation for the Government, exhausting the patience of the international community and provoking the renegotiation of the Lusaka Protocol.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">We have always assumed that participation in Angolan society by a UNITA that has been transformed into a true political party is fundamental and healthy for the functioning of our democracy. So we do not understand why UNITA should create difficulties that prevent it from playing its role as a political party in accordance with Angolan law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">The Government, together with UNAVEM and the troika of observers, is now undertaking intensive efforts towards satisfactorily completing all pending military tasks, towards the swearing in of the deputies and towards the formation of a Government of National Unity. We continue to hope that UNITA will cooperate by not insisting on hampering the achievement of these important objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">Given the prospects for success in the implementation of the peace accords, the Council should begin to study the future role to be played by the United Nations, taking into consideration that some tasks will remain to be completed and that others, by their nature, will continue to require the assistance of the personnel and framework of the United Nations. The extension of State administration, completion of the formation of the Angolan Armed Forces, the integration of UNITA personnel into the National Police, the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants, and the removal of mines and other explosive devices are, as of now, some of the areas which should receive priority. Their achievement will help guarantee the country's political and military stability.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">It is also in the light of the prospect of success of the peace accords that the Government expects the beginning of a more effective and comprehensive implementation of the community rehabilitation and national reconciliation programme. I would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks to the Governments and international institutions which are helping this programme, and to appeal to those that promised to provide funds during the round table held in Brussels in 1994 to honour their commitments, so that Angola can enter a new era of economic and social progress.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">Allow me to express, on behalf of the Angolan people and Government, our most profound gratitude, and to underscore the dedication and spirit of sacrifice of all UNAVEM personnel, some of whom have lost their lives or have became incapacitated as they carried out their noble duties.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">We must also highlight the active role played by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, who has been a tireless negotiator and advocate for the cause of peace in Angola, as well as the contributions of the countries of the troika -- the United States, Portugal and the Russian Federation -- the Organization of African Unity, the troop-contributing countries, and all Governments that have continued to offer their help to restore peace and stability in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">Finally, we wish to thank the Governments, the United Nations humanitarian agencies and the non-governmental organizations for their generous assistance to the populations most affected by the war.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">I should like also to take this opportunity to convey, on behalf of the Angolan Government, our most profound condolences to the Ambassador of China on the passing of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, an outstanding Chinese leader and political figure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">The draft resolution to be adopted today has the support of my Government, and it is our hope that it will contribute to speeding the restoration of peace in Angola.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the Vice-Minister without Portfolio of the Republic of Angola for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">It is with pleasure that I wish to welcome His Excellency General Higino Carneiro, the Vice-Minister without Portfolio of the Republic of Angola, and to thank him for a most instructive statement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">We note also with satisfaction the presence among us of Mr. Beye, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, who, along with the troika of Observer States, is working actively for the settlement of the Angolan problem. The Russian Federation, which is a member of the troika, is deeply interested in the success and progress of the peace process and in the rapid restoration of stability and peace in that country. We are sparing no effort to attain those objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Putting an end to the many years of conflict in Angola -- the last unsettled hotbed of tension in southern Africa -- would be a major blessing for the people of that country and of the countries of the region, and it would also represent a substantial success for the peacemaking activities of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">While we note with satisfaction that Angola, step by step, has been making its way towards peace, we are concerned at the fact that this process is proceeding with difficulty, constantly encountering new obstacles because of the lack of due cooperation on the part of UNITA. As a result, in recent months once again the pace of implementation of military and other tasks has been slowed down, and twice agreements for a time-table for the establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation have been broken off. This is undermining the trust so painstakingly established between the Angolan parties and is complicating the situation in the country as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">The Russian delegation agrees with the conclusion of the report of the Secretary-General to the effect that attempts to link up various aspects of the peace process and to evade contracted obligations should immediately be put to an end. It is only on that basis that the international community can continue effective support for the peace process in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">We believe that, as the settlement has entered a decisive and complex phase, we must now send the Angolan parties, and first and foremost UNITA, a clear-cut signal on the inadmissibility of further delays in resolving military and other issues and in establishing a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. This is of critical importance to the success of the entire peace process and that of national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">On this basis, we support the option proposed in the report of the Secretary-General to extend the current mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) for one month, along with a clear-cut warning that if, by 31 March, no such Government has been established because of procrastination on the part of UNITA, the Security Council will have to consider taking appropriate and concrete measures with regard to that organization. We hope that this extremely clear signal will be correctly understood by UNITA and that the Angolan parties will effectively use the additional time given them for a speedy movement forward of the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">We believe that the draft resolution submitted for consideration by the Security Council is adequate to the task at this current stage of the Angolan settlement. Along with other members of the Security Council, we will vote in its favour.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Konishi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I should like to welcome the presence of the Vice-Minister without Portfolio of the Republic of Angola, His Excellency General Higino Carneiro. I should like also to express my sincere appreciation to the Special Representative, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, and to the representatives of the troika countries -- Portugal, the Russian Federation and the United States -- for their dedicated efforts to foster and support the peace process in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Permit me first of all to state that Japan supports the draft resolution before us and in particular the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) for an additional month, until 31 March 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">At the same time, I must hasten to add that my Government finds it profoundly regrettable that it was the failure, once again, of the parties concerned to establish a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation that has compelled the Security Council to take this decision. While Japan recognizes that some progress has been made, it urgently calls upon UNITA in particular to cooperate in efforts to advance the peace process without any linkages or further delay.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">We have strong hopes that in the report the Secretary-General is to submit to the Council on 20 March, he will be able to confirm that the long-awaited goal of the formation of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation has in fact been achieved.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Other issues of serious concern must be addressed. I refer in particular to the quartering and demobilization of UNITA troops and their integration into the joint Angolan Armed Forces. My delegation also stresses the importance of guaranteeing the safety of personnel engaged in humanitarian activities. The peace process cannot be considered to have been successfully concluded until these issues are resolved.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">As was made clear in the presidential statement of 30 January, it is up to the Angolans themselves to restore peace in their country. UNAVEM III and an anticipated follow-on presence can only assist them in their efforts, and cannot remain in Angola indefinitely. Thus it is imperative that all parties, especially UNITA, demonstrate a commitment to the peace process by establishing a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation without further delay.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">My delegation believes that once this goal has been achieved and the follow-on Mission is in place, it will play an important role in promoting reconciliation throughout the nation. In this regard, we support the recommendation of the Secretary-General to maintain and enhance the Political Affairs Division of UNAVEM III as the transition to the follow-on Mission proceeds. Japan also hopes that this Mission will be effective in educating citizens in such areas as the consolidation of peace, the promotion of national reconciliation and respect for human rights, and the multi-party system of government by disseminating the necessary information. It may be suggested that the Secretary-General report to the Council on the activities of the follow-on Mission on a regular basis. Once the details of this Mission -- such as its mandate, modalities and time-frame -- are worked out, Japan, for its part, will be ready to consider how it can best contribute to the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">Japan has been making various contributions to expedite the peace process in Angola. Let me cite just two areas in which it has provided assistance. Deeply concerned at the proliferation of landmines, whose victims are most often innocent civilians, Japan has earmarked for demining activities in Angola $1.4 million of the $2 million it contributed to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance. It has also made a contribution of $1 million through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to support the return and resettlement of Angolan refugees who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">Once it is apparent that peace has taken root throughout the nation with the establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, Japan will be in a position to consider making further contributions, taking into consideration the needs for reconstruction and development of the country as a whole.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Richmond</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">I would first like to welcome the leader of the Angolan delegation, General Carneiro, and also express our appreciation for the untiring efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Beye, and for the efforts of the representatives of the troika.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">At the end of December, when the Council last extended the mandate of United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), a goal of 28 February 1997 was set for the parties in Angola to complete their peace process commitments. It is very disappointing that, due largely to a lack of cooperation from UNITA, the date for the formation of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation has still not been set and that a number of other issues are still outstanding. The people of Angola deserve better than these repeated delays and unfulfilled commitments. We urge both parties, but particularly UNITA, to put an end to brinkmanship, to drop the linkages and conditions which create an atmosphere of mistrust and to show the flexibility and commitment which are now essential to finishing the job.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">It is clear what needs to be done. UNITA must stop its delaying tactics and send its deputies to the National Assembly and its nominated members of the future Government of National Unity and Reconciliation to Luanda. The Government of National Unity and Reconciliation must be established by the end of March. The outstanding political and military aspects of the peace process, including the selection and incorporation of UNITA soldiers into the Angolan Armed Forces, must be completed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">We should also like to see an early meeting between President Dos Santos and Mr. Savimbi in Angola. That would be a welcome and visible signal of the commitment of both leaders to moving the peace process forward.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">To allow these tasks to be accomplished, we are in favour of extending the mandate of UNAVEM III until 31 March 1997, as proposed in the draft resolution before us. But the international community will be watching the situation closely. In his report, the Secretary-General suggests that the Security Council might consider appropriate steps if a new Government has not been formed by the end of March. We hope that this will not be necessary, but nobody should be in no doubt that we are prepared to consider such steps in those circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">We support the Secretary-General's recommendation on a follow-on observer mission, including the increased number of human rights monitors. We agree that a continued United Nations presence will be necessary to consolidate the peace process, but we hope that its role will be complete by the end of 1997. By then, we hope the international community will be focusing its efforts on assisting the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation with the enormous task of reconstruction and rehabilitation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">The United Nations and, through it, the wider international community have made an enormous investment in bringing peace to Angola since the parties signed the Lusaka Protocol in November 1994. The British Government is ready to join the rest of the international community in continuing to help the people of Angola so that they can begin to enjoy the economic prosperity and political stability that only a successful peace process can bring. But none of this will be possible unless the parties, and UNITA in particular, honour their obligations and move quickly to complete the outstanding tasks. The responsibility is theirs.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Elaraby</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for the information and observations contained in his latest report on the situation in Angola (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-115.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/115</a>). I should also like to extend my thanks and appreciation to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, for his strenuous and constructive efforts to achieve peace in Angola. I would like to welcome General Carneiro, who is participating in this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">In its presidential statement three weeks ago, the Security Council called upon the Angolan Government and UNITA to implement the commitments they had undertaken in January: the formation of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation; the arrival of 17 UNITA deputies in Luanda to take their seats in Parliament; and the settlement of the question of the special status of Mr. Savimbi. We are deeply concerned that -- despite the continued efforts of the United Nations, Special Representative Mr. Beye, the three troika countries and the countries of the Southern African Development Community -- these undertakings have been only partially implemented.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">The delegation of Egypt, like others, believes that only UNITA's determined political will to become a political party and to abstain from any practice that would delay the implementation of the peace agreement break the stalemate in implementing the Lusaka Protocol. We are convinced that this cannot be achieved without pressure being exerted by the international community and the troika countries on the UNITA leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">The Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Beye, mentioned yesterday when he met with the members of the Security Council that the United Nations has achieved concrete progress. He referred to the halt to bloodshed among Angolans and to the quartering of UNITA forces in camps. I would like to add to the list the success of the United Nations in training Angolans in demining, as well as its efforts to repair bridges and roads and rebuild the infrastructure of the country. These are successes worth mentioning.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">Paragraphs 22 and 50 of the report of the Secretary-General refer to the critical shortfall in the financing necessary to maintain the 15 quartering areas of UNITA forces -- which have to be kept until the end of next month -- and to the fact that the unpaid assessed contributions to the Special Account for UNAVEM for the period since its inception amounted to $150.2 million. These points deserve the special attention of the members of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">The delegation of Egypt would like to affirm its support for the Secretary-General's recommendations in his report regarding the future of UNAVEM III. In particular, we support those related to continuing the United Nations presence in Angola during 1997. We are also in favour of keeping the Special Representative in Luanda and providing him with the necessary support personnel. Moreover, we support increasing the strength of the Mission's civilian police and maintaining the logistics staff until next August.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Park</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">We note with serious concern and deep frustration that the progress in the Angolan peace process during the last few weeks has not matched our expectations, despite the presidential statement the Security Council adopted on 30 January. We anxiously expected positive progress to take place through consultations in the Joint Commission and through other facilitating efforts by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the troika of observer countries.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">May I also take this opportunity to welcome the Vice-Minister without portfolio of the Angolan Government, General Carneiro, whose statement was greatly appreciated by my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">We are now once again extending the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) without that mandate having been completely fulfilled due to procrastination by the direct parties to the peace process. Despite this frustration, we certainly believe that the gains achieved so far in the Angolan peace process have to be maintained and strengthened to new levels. The enormous efforts and resources that the international community has put into the cause of peace in Angola simply should not be allowed to end short of a success. The Angolan peace process stands now at a critical juncture, and we must make another definitive push to help establish a unified Government and speed up the consolidation of peace and national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">To achieve this, we believe that the international community should at this time give a firm and unequivocal message to the Angolan parties. They must realize that any further procrastination in the peace process will not be tolerated. We should make clear once again that continued international support, including the presence of UNAVEM III, is linked to progress in the peace process, and that the Council will consider further measures on that basis. For this reason, we support the recommendation of the Secretary-General to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III for one month, with the clear indication that the Council is considering the imposition of stronger measures against those responsible for delays. The draft resolution before the Council reflects such an approach and we will vote in its favour.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">In the same vein, we also believe that the question of a post-UNAVEM-III United Nations presence should be carefully scrutinized in the light of progress in the Angolan peace process. In this regard, we remind the Angolan parties once again that the ultimate responsibility for peace and reconciliation in Angola rests with the Angolan parties themselves. The future of Angola lies in no other hands but theirs.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Finally, we would also like to stress the importance of the expeditious implementation of the many tasks remaining under the Lusaka Protocol, aside from the establishment of a unified Government. Peace cannot take firm root unless such problems as the high number of deserters from quartering areas, the delay in the formation of a unified armed forces and the unsatisfactory level of disarmament of civilians are expeditiously addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Let me conclude by expressing our sincere hope that we all can soon celebrate the establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation and see all the remaining issues resolved by the time Council meets again to consider this matter.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Monteiro</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Portugal has reason to believe that the Angolan peace process shows positive signs. Although there has been slow progress in certain areas, one cannot speak of stagnation. In fact, the ceasefire is holding, and the Government of Angola and UNITA are showing that they remain committed to political dialogue. However, both parties, and in particular UNITA, must now also indicate clearly to the international community that they are willing to abide by the agreements to which they freely subscribed. This has been essentially a stop-and-go process. The Security Council, in its presidential statement of 30 January 1997, reminded UNITA and the Government of Angola that the international community can only provide assistance if progress is achieved in the peace process, and that it is in this context that it will consider a United Nations presence in Angola after the expiration of the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Significant and crucial tasks in both military and political aspects of the peace process remain unfulfilled and are behind schedule. In fact, over the last two weeks, since the publication of the report of the Secretary-General, no significant moves have been made in the selection and incorporation of UNITA personnel into the Angolan Armed Forces, in the closure of quartering areas, in the process of demobilization and in the extension of State administration throughout the entire territory of Angola. Recent reports that the procedures concerning demobilization and the extension of the administration have been agreed upon by the Government of Angola and UNITA are, however, encouraging. On the other hand, and despite the agreement reached in the Joint Commission, UNITA failed to send to Luanda by 12 February all of its members with seats in the National Assembly and all those designated to take part in the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. In fact, UNITA bears a special responsibility to demonstrate its commitment to the full implementation of the "Acordos de Paz" and the Lusaka Protocol, without attempting to establish new conditions or linkages.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">The Security Council has before it a draft resolution extending the mandate of UNAVEM III, this time until 31 March. This gives the parties one month to move the peace process forward by completing the remaining tasks, no more, no less.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">The complexity of the issues in the Angolan peace process require some flexibility on the part of the international community. Today, at a time when UNAVEM III should be completing its mission, we recognize that the United Nations must continue its current mandate in support of the peace process. We fully agree with the view expressed in the most recent report of the Secretary-General that the pace of the planned withdrawal of formed military units should take into account the situation on the ground. We must not lose sight of the fact that the United Nations plays a vital role in bringing peace to Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">The peace process in Angola has reached a crossroads. This resolution indicates clearly the way to proceed. The remaining tasks under the "Acordos de Paz" and the Lusaka Protocol must be completed within the next month. We appeal to all concerned to take the right path and lead the weary Angolan people to a brighter future. Allow me to reaffirm how much we appreciate the remarkable work of Mr. Beye, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. We pay tribute to his untiring efforts on the ground, and we thank him in particular for travelling to New York to brief the Council. His presence here has been enlightening and informative. His commitment to peace in Angola and his faith in the process make us all more confident that our efforts will succeed.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">This is in accordance with a sentence that the distinguished representative of the Angolan Government, General Higino Carneiro, spoke just a few minutes ago: "the path to peace seems irreversible". <i>(Supra, p. 2</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">We all hope so.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Osvald</span> <span class="nation">Sweden</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">My delegation wishes, first of all, to welcome General Carneiro, Vice-Minister without Portfolio of Angola, to our debate today. When the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) was established two years ago, it was envisaged that the Lusaka Protocol would be fully implemented by the beginning of 1997. Despite considerable progress in the peace process, not all commitments under the Protocol have been fulfilled. A number of political and military aspects remain to be implemented. Sweden urges both parties, in particular UNITA, to fulfil all their obligations under the peace accords.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">The United Nations has played a crucial role in the Angolan peace process. The Organization has an important role to play in seeing the peace process through and in consolidating the gains achieved so far. However, we must remember that it is the Angolan parties which bear the ultimate responsibility for restoring peace in Angola. The success of the peace process requires strong determination and efforts to build mutual trust.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Today, the Security Council is sending a clear message to Angola. The failure of UNITA to implement fully the conclusions of the meeting of the Joint Commission on 23 January this year is cause for deep concern. All UNITA National Assembly members and officials designated to the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation must arrive in Luanda and assume their respective posts. The Government of National Unity and Reconciliation must be established without further delay.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">The completion of the process of selection and incorporation of the UNITA troops into the Angolan Armed Forces is another essential component in the process ahead, as is a successful and orderly demobilization. The international community must continue to extend its full support to demobilization efforts, not least the efforts directed at the demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers. We have an unequivocal responsibility towards these children, the most vulnerable victims of conflict: to recognize their plight, to condemn and prevent the exploitation of children in conflicts and to do what is in our power to help provide a future for those already exposed to the scourge of war.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Sweden is a contributor to UNAVEM III. The pace of the planned withdrawal of the United Nations formed military units must, in our view, take into account both the short extension of the UNAVEM III mandate and the situation on the ground. Sweden's long-standing commitment to the peace process in Angola stands firm. We have contributed military observers, civilian police and demining specialists to UNAVEM III and made significant financial contributions to support Angola's transition from a war-torn country. It is our firm hope that the next time we discuss Angola in the Security Council, it will be on the basis of definite progress in the peace process. In view of the fact that the Government has not yet been formed, Sweden agrees with the Secretary-General that the mandate of UNAVEM III should be extended by one month. We will vote in favour of the draft before the Council today.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">In conclusion, I should like to express the appreciation of my Government to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, to the three observer States -- Portugal, the Russian Federation and the United States -- and to the personnel of UNAVEM III for their efforts to assist the parties in advancing the peace process.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Mackenna</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I should like to welcome the Vice-Minister without Portfolio of Angola, General Carneiro.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Tomorrow, it will be two years since the establishment of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III). On this occasion, the Council should be considering the follow-up to that United Nations operation following the implementation of the Angolan peace accords. Unfortunately, this has not proved possible, as the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation has not yet been formed in Angola and the implementation of the remaining political and military aspects of the peace process has been delayed. That is why we have before us a draft resolution renewing the mandate of UNAVEM III for one month and urging the parties, in particular UNITA, to establish such a Government without further delay and to resolve all outstanding questions, including military issues.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The draft resolution is concise, but it contains a clear and direct message. My delegation will support it and hopes that it will be properly received by those to whom it is directed.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Although this has been a long and difficult process, there have been positive results. Nevertheless, it is clear that the problems in Angola have not yet come to an end and we can foresee difficulties on the political horizon. The parties, in particular UNITA, must seek to fulfil their commitments, consolidate peace and lead their people on the path of development. For all of these reasons, my delegation, along with the entire international community, will pay great attention to events in Angola during this crucial period in its history.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">In conclusion, I should like to place on record our thanks to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Beye, to the troika of observer States, and to all of those in the field who have made it possible for Angola to move off the path of war and embark on the path of peace.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Liu Jieyi</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">At the outset, the delegation of China would like to thank the Vice-Minister without Portfolio of Angola, General Carneiro, for his condolences on the passing of Mr. Deng Xiaoping. The delegation of China will convey his sentiments to the Chinese Government and people and to the family of Mr. Deng Xiaoping.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">The Chinese delegation is deeply concerned about the series of reversals suffered by the peace process and by the repeated delays in the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. It may be recalled that the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which was plagued by outstanding problems in the military area, was long delayed. After subsequent efforts by the parties, the military component is finally nearing completion. Unfortunately, the peace process is now experiencing a similar stalling and stalemate in the political area. This is deeply disturbing to the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">As the Secretary-General has pointed out numerous times, the resolution of the question of Angola ultimately rests with the Angolan people themselves. After years of strife, Angola has its work cut out. The Angolan people are in dire need of a tranquil life and a stable environment conducive to rehabilitation and reconstruction. The Chinese delegation has appealed on many occasions, and will appeal here once again, to the two sides in Angola, in particular UNITA, to take to heart the interests of the nation and the aspirations of their people, demonstrate the necessary good faith and positive attitude and resolve their differences through consultations. We call on them to take effective action to complete all the tasks outlined in the Lusaka Protocol and the mutually agreed consolidated timetable so as successfully to conclude the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-976(1995).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 976 (1995)</a>, the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) is due to complete its mission at the end of this month. Since its establishment, this, the largest peacekeeping operation ever, has made important contributions to monitoring the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, facilitating the restoration of peace to Angola and bringing about national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">We understood that at this crucial juncture in the peace process, there is an urgent need for generous assistance from the international community, including from the United Nations. Accordingly, the Chinese delegation supports the extension of the mandate of UNAVEM III to 31 March and will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us. At the same time, we believe that the success of the peacekeeping operation hinges on the cooperation and support of the parties concerned. We hope that both sides in Angola, particularly UNITA, will seize this opportunity to cooperate with UNAVEM III with a view to bringing the peace process in Angola to fruition. We also hope that other actors, including African countries, will continue to play a positive role in bringing peace to Angola. China, for its part, will continue to make its contribution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">Finally, I would like to thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his Special Representative, Maître Beye, as well as the three observer States and the personnel of UNAVEM for their contribution to the peace process in Angola.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cabral</span> <span class="nation">Guinea-Bissau</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like to join in welcoming the head of the Angolan delegation. I thank him for his contribution to our debate.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">After two years, the mandate for the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) is drawing to an end, at least in legal terms. It is therefore time to take stock, an exercise that is often instructive but always difficult to carry out. The Angolan problem is too complex and requires us to abandon our customary methods of analysis and understanding -- methods that may nonetheless be useful in other situations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">My delegation is pleased that this concern has served as a guiding principle in the drafting of the Secretary-General's report, the speedy delivery and clearsightedness of which we commend.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">In order to be objective, any stock-taking, however provisional, must be based on a variety of observations and take into account facts whose importance and nature cannot be translated into figures, eluding as they do otherwise valid bookkeeping standards. Some imponderables are difficult to quantify. Some progress, linked to the psychological aspect of negotiations, cannot, unfortunately, be expressed in numbers and calculations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">For us, it is not a question of simply judging, even if we believe that there is nothing wrong with noting the difficulties of a process which, however complicated, is still subject to standard, unavoidable rules. We should not lose hope, even if there are reasons for dissatisfaction. The steps we take should be motivational, because it is our duty to encourage. Our responsibility is to support all those of good will who have made the unity and national reconciliation of Angola their prime concern, their crusade and their reason for hope.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Yes, there have been delays -- many delays, even -- in the establishment of structures provided for under the Lusaka Protocol. Yes, the agreed timetable has not been respected. But does this mean that no progress has been made? The truth is that a momentum has been established, even though it remains characterized by slow, sometimes hesitant steps where we would prefer to see long, vigorous strides. The peace process has advanced and is still advancing. It is not accelerating, but the progress is continual. The major obstacles have been or are about to be eliminated. There is still the crucial issue of restoring the long-shaken trust between the protagonists. Indeed, we must solve the psychological problems by promoting a culture of peace and of national reconciliation, a goal which the international community has pursued with regularity and determination.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">Therein lies the merit of the United Nations and of all those who, on our behalf, are working tirelessly to consolidate peace in Angola. Never has a United Nations operation mobilized so many human and financial resources in response to the appeal of a people in distress. We are therefore deeply beholden to the members of UNAVEM III, who, sometimes at risk to their lives, are fighting alongside our Angolan brothers to win the battle for peace. I should like here to welcome among us of the leader of them all, Maître Blondin Beye, Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Angola, a skilful and inventive negotiator, to whom we pay tribute for his dedication, foresight, determination and unflinching optimism, without which the road to peace would have been far longer.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The results show the validity of this United Nations Mission and the exemplary qualities of those who have agreed to shoulder, on our behalf, the responsibility for conducting it successfully. We should like here and now to thank them most warmly.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">After so much effort on the part of the international community, can any outcome to the problem in Angola be imagined other than the restoration of peace, the establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation? Both of these should constitute cornerstones in the construction of a new type of relations among brothers who were enemies only yesterday. This Government is necessary not just because it will symbolize the participation of all political parties represented in the Parliament, but because it establishes an important starting point for efforts to strengthen still fragile balances and constitutes a special forum for joint action that can help the taking of decisions devoted to the common management of national affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">Indeed, it is in the sharing of fully assumed responsibilities by all the political protagonists in the future of the Angolan people that will be forged a national solidarity indispensable to the establishment of well-being for all and of the Angolan nation in full unity. There is no better alternative than that leading to a true peace with honour, a peace of minds and hearts, so necessary to the monumental work of national reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa11">The international community is duty-bound to contribute to and ensure national harmony in Angola while creating conditions for a better life for the Angolan people, a heroic people that has suffered immensely and deserves finally, and I hope permanently, to enjoy peace.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa12">We must therefore persevere. We must do our utmost to convince those who still have doubts today -- doubts that are sometimes valid -- and work to establish a climate of mutual trust. All Angolans, whether they belong to the party in power or to UNITA, must try to look beyond themselves and take part in the long-awaited national renewal. The path has been long, the difficulties enormous, but the dawn of hope is breaking. Let us be firm without being dogmatic; let us contain our frustrations and overcome our impatience, however legitimate. Let us see to it that there are no longer any unjustifiable delays or destructive disagreement. Let us urge Angolans to establish trust amongst themselves and to work together in a pluralistic democracy that respects the rights of all. We must encourage our Angolan friends to build their nation and to work for the betterment of their country and the well-being of their people. Let us attempt to promote a culture of peace, unity and national reconciliation, in that country so dear to our hearts whose destiny is indissolubly linked to the common future of all Africans.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa13">These are the unfailing intentions of my country, Guinea-Bissau, whose delegation today will vote in favour of the draft resolution under consideration, with the renewed hope that the next report of the Secretary-General will give us all reason to celebrate the victory of the Angolan people over themselves and the enshrinement of the immeasurable contribution made by the international community to the establishment of peace in Angola and therefore in the rest of the African continent.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Berrocal Soto</span> <span class="nation">Costa Rica</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">Allow me at the outset to associate myself with all of those who have extended a welcome to the representative of the Government of Angola, General Carneiro, the Vice-Minister without Portfolio.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">My country fully supports the draft resolution that is under consideration by the Security Council regarding the situation in Angola based on the "Acordos de Paz para Angola", the Lusaka Protocol and prior resolutions of the Security Council. This is a meaningful and well-balanced draft that reflects the criticism and concern expressed by delegations in informal meetings and consultations regarding the urgent need for the Government of Angola, and in particular UNITA, to resolve all the remaining military and other problems and form without further delay the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">In this connection, Costa Rica would like to express its deep regret at the delays that have hindered and slowed the formation of that Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. We also wish to appeal to the highest leaders of UNITA so that the Ministers, deputies and senior military and civilian leaders with positions of responsibility will effectively and without further delay arrive in Luanda, in accordance with the process agreed to with the Government of Angola. We believe that this is the crucial issue. This is the wish of the international community, and it is the explicit and clear message of the draft resolution that the Security Council is about to adopt.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">On the basis of the work of that Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, the people of Angola will embark on the path to a mature and responsible democracy. War will be left behind, and so must any unilateral will for domination on the part of any of the parties. What is urgent now is to create a democratic culture of peace and of national reconciliation so that soon, in free elections and without pressure, the Angolan people will be able freely to express their views and decide on their future. It is up to the people of Angola alone to assume that paramount responsibility of voting and deciding.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">What lies ahead for the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation is therefore a commitment that entails enormous historical responsibilities. It must enact fundamental laws and create the necessary political conditions and infrastructure so that in free elections, the people of Angola will be able to express themselves democratically. This is the spirit of the "Acordos de Paz"; it is the spirit of the Lusaka Protocol. This is also the wish of the international community, and it is the message that is contained in this draft resolution of the Security Council. We fully share these feelings, and for this reason we associate ourselves with our vote on this draft resolution on Angola and with the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) until 31 March 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Finally, I should like, on behalf of my delegation, to express my country's gratitude to the countries of the troika -- the Russian Federation, the United States and Portugal -- for their valuable contribution to the peace process in Angola, We also wish to express our gratitude to Mr. Beye, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, who has been a primary protagonist in the quest for peace in Angola.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Richardson</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">Let me begin by noting that this is my first opportunity -- and, accordingly, a distinct honor -- to deliver an explanation of vote on behalf of the United States in the Council. Again, I thank my other colleagues on the Council for their very warm welcome.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">We welcome the Secretary-General's report on the situation in Angola and express our appreciation for the efforts of the Special Representative. We also welcome the General and his delegation here this afternoon. We wish to add our thanks for the contributions of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), and also to thank the States that provide personnel for UNAVEM III.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Today, as we consider the extension of the UNAVEM III mandate, we must confront the reality that the time-tables agreed to and the actions promised by the parties in Angola to advance the peace process have not been fulfilled. The Government of National Unity and Reconciliation was not formed on 25 January, and the difficult task of extending central government control over the entire country has been delayed. In addition, the camps established as an interim measure in demobilizing UNITA's forces are still full, even though the UNAVEM III forces that protect these camps are scheduled to be withdrawn.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">My Government is dismayed at these delays in the implementation of the peace process. Because of these delays, the Security Council draft resolution, in line with the Secretary-General's recommendations, provides only for a one-month extension of UNAVEM III's mandate. During this period, UNAVEM III's remaining personnel will continue to perform their missions while the withdrawal continues, and the Security Council will review its involvement in the Angolan peace process. Our future course will be determined by the progress made by the parties in Angola in implementing fully their commitments under the Lusaka Protocol.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">The message for the parties, especially UNITA, is clear. We are deeply concerned with UNITA's primary role in causing the failure of the time-table established by the Joint Commission for the formation of the unity Government. The draft resolution notes the readiness of the Council to consider the imposition of further measures if the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation is not formed by 20 March. We are willing to hold this action in abeyance for only a short while longer. Too much time has already been wasted. Too many Angolans continue to suffer. The benefits of peace must replace the constantly delayed hopes of the people of Angola. All the Angolan people seek is an end to death and destruction and a chance to rebuild their shattered lives.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">We would also warn the parties against any involvement in the conflict in Zaire. We have reaffirmed the presidential statement of 7 February 1997, which</p>
	<blockquote id="pg012-bk01-pa07">"calls upon all States in the region to refrain, in accordance with their obligations under the Charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, from any act, including cross-border incursions, which would threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any State and exacerbate the situation in the region, including endangering the refugees and displaced persons." <i>(S/PRST/1997/5, p. 1)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">The United States remains a strong friend of Angola, and we are proud of the role we have played in the troika of Observer States. I wish to commend our good friend the Ambassador of Portugal for his successful efforts and the Ambassador of Russia for his participation in this effort.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">We all remain committed to a peaceful and prosperous future for Angola. The United States provided $104.7 million in humanitarian and development assistance to Angola in fiscal year 1996, and expects to provide nearly $92 million this fiscal year.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">I have seen firsthand, as many here have, the terrible devastation and the enormous suffering that this conflict has inflicted on the people of Angola. I have visited this country three times. All the Angolan people seek is a chance for peace, reconciliation and reconstruction, and I believe that we all feel that they are entitled to that opportunity. Accordingly, we urge the parties to understand the message of this draft resolution. The international community has already played its part in helping the Government of Angola and UNITA meet their commitments to peace. Now we are waiting for them to live up to their promises. They must do so if this international support is to continue. It is time to clear the camps of the former unity Government and to get on with the task of building peace.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">Kenya welcomes the report of the Secretary-General, which deals comprehensively with the main issues on the situation in Angola. We are grateful to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, for their efforts in that country. My delegation also appreciates the role that the troika has played in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Kenya has consistently advocated that, if everything works according to plan, at the expiration of the current mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), there should be some form of follow-on presence of the United Nations in that country. It is therefore noteworthy that in his report the Secretary-General has seen the need for such a presence and has made concrete recommendations for a reconstituted United Nations presence in the form of an observer mission, with its various necessary components to be determined according to the needs of the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">My delegation regretfully notes that despite the numerous opportunities afforded to the parties to ensure the successful implementation of the peace accord, they have failed to fulfil their obligations as expected. As a result, there has been a serious lack of progress, and the proposed formation of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation has lately been postponed on two occasions. We are concerned at the wasted opportunity.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">My delegation wishes to reiterate the importance it attaches to the full implementation by the Government of Angola and UNITA of the peace accords and the relevant Security Council resolutions, and is disappointed at the continued postponement of the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. Kenya believes that formation of a unity Government would be the culmination of the current efforts in the search for peace and would mark the beginning of the consolidation of that peace.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">We call upon UNITA to cooperate with the Government of Angola in the remaining tasks leading to the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. We also call upon UNITA to cooperate with the Government of Angola in implementing the remaining stages of the peace process, including the military aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">My delegation has thoroughly studied the report of the Secretary-General and his recommendations, and has concluded that they are appropriate in the current circumstances. We therefore support the draft resolution. We hope that the message we shall send by adopting it will trigger some movement towards progress in the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">I now put to the vote the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1997-162.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/162</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ladsous</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa01">I would first like to welcome Mr. Carneiro, Vice-Minister without Portfolio of Angola, and also the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Beye, whom I would also like to commend for his talent and dedication through these difficult years.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa02">Two years ago, in February 1995, the Council, by adopting <a href="../pdf/S-RES-976(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 976 (1995)</a>, requested that the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) be completed in February 1997, that is, at a date when the objectives of the Lusaka Protocol were to be achieved. Unfortunately, we must note that this is not the case. UNITA bears primary responsibility for the many delays which today compel us once again to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa03">Of course, a great deal has been done in the last 12 months. Peace in Angola is now at hand. However, UNITA must make the final efforts necessary to comply with the obligations it has entered into by signing the Lusaka Protocol. This of course concerns the military aspect of the agreement, which has not been fully implemented, but also -- and above all -- the establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, which should have been set up this month.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa04">The establishment of this government is in fact a crucial stage for the Angolan people. It constitutes the real culmination of the peace process. This government must now be quickly established. It is also absolutely necessary that the former belligerents demonstrate close coordination to enable the future Government of Angola to establish its authority over the entire territory. Finally, we hope that the demobilization of soldiers which have not yet been incorporated into the Angolan Armed Forces may be carried out promptly and with the continued support of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa05"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1098(1997).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1098 (1997)</a> provides that the Council could consider imposing new measures against UNITA pursuant to paragraph 26 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a> of 15 September 1993, if the Government is not established within the required time frame. We keenly hope that we will not have to go to that extreme. It would in fact be very disappointing to encounter new difficulties now that we are getting very close to our goals.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa06">The Angolan people legitimately aspires to peace and security. In the past 10 years southern Africa has seen considerable development; Angolans deserve -- after all the trials they have endured -- to benefit from these changes, which will allow them to enjoy democracy and sustainable development.</p>

	<p id="pg014-bk04-pa01">A number of speakers still remain on my list. However, given the lateness of the hour, I now propose, with the consent of the Council, to suspend the meeting until 3.30 p.m.</p>

<div class="italicline" id="pg014-bk05">

	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa01">The next speaker is the Permanent Representative of Malawi. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk07">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rubadiri</span> <span class="nation">Malawi</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk07-pa01">We extend to you, Sir, our most sincere congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of February. We congratulate equally your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of Japan, who served as President for the month of January.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk07-pa02">The Malawi delegation has read with keen interest the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), as contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1997-115.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/115</a> of 7 February 1997. We have also monitored developments in that country, which has suffered for too long, and whose people's longing for peace and tranquility cannot be denied any longer.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk07-pa03">We are very disappointed that today, on the eve of the day on which we were supposed to be celebrating the completion of the mandate of UNAVEM III, we are, alas, in no mood for joyful ululation. We are most concerned that UNITA has once again seen fit to delay the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, contrary to the letter and spirit of the Lusaka Protocol, and against a whole wave of international public opinion. From the Southern African Development Community (SADC), from the rest of Africa, and from the international community at large come prayers for peace in this cherished African land that fed foreign explorers and was a way-station as they journeyed to the Far East.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk07-pa04">We are concerned that there are other remaining political and military aspects of the whole process which, if delayed further, would bring about a major setback to the peace process. Questions relating to the selection of UNITA soldiers and their incorporation into the armed forces, as well as to general demobilization, need to be addressed more resolutely.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk07-pa05">Once again, we appeal to all the parties concerned, particularly to UNITA, to exert extra efforts to take the necessary action that will meaningfully translate into practical results the aspirations of the Angolan people -- and of all of us here, and everywhere, who believe that peace and the process of reconstruction and development in Angola cannot be delayed any longer. The African vision, during Africa's tenure of leadership of the United Nations into the twenty-first century, holds dear the resolution of this bloody conflict in historic Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk07-pa06">The international community will continue, as it has in the past, to play a critical role in the successful outcome of developments in Angola. We welcome the useful analysis and recommendations set out by the Secretary-General in his report. The international community, however, cannot, with a clear conscience, abandon Angola now. Many challenges still lie ahead. We are most gratified that the Security Council is today ready to meet this challenge. We support the extension of the mandate of UNAVEM III, as agreed by the Council this afternoon. We also support the activation of the relevant provision of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a> of 15 September 1993, should UNITA continue its intransigent ways. We are therefore happy that the resolution before the Security Council has been unanimously adopted by all the member countries.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk07-pa07">Let me conclude by acknowledging, as we have done previously, the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, and all UNAVEM III personnel and humanitarian workers, whose work in very difficult circumstances has made it abundantly clear that the service for peace is a godly endeavour. We pay particular tribute to those whose lives have been lost to this noble cause. For them, and for the concern of us all, we must send a strong message to the leadership of UNITA that it is a living Angola that must be born, not the carcass of a mutilated citizenry of orphaned children, women and old men.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk07-pa08">We pray that the next time the Council meets on this issue it will be to take on the duty of rebuilding lives and rebuilding a nation.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Malawi for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Mozambique. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dos Santos</span> <span class="nation">Mozambique</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I would like to join others who have spoken before me in congratulating you, Sir, on the magnificent leadership you have provided this Council in the month of February. We are particularly happy to see you preside over our deliberations on the important agenda item before this body today. My delegation extends its sincere congratulations to your predecessor, Ambassador Hisashi Owada, Permanent Representative of Japan, for the remarkable way in which he guided the affairs of the Council for the month of January.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">Allow me also to express my delegation's gratitude to the Secretary-General for the comprehensive report before us today and for his efforts in search of real peace and reconciliation in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">When we last addressed the Council, we expressed our concern at the slow pace of the implementation of the "Acordos de Paz" for Angola and of the relevant resolutions of this body. While we appreciate the encouraging developments, as presented in the Secretary-General's report, we cannot fail to register our desire to see greater commitment translated into concrete action, particularly on the part of UNITA.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">From the messages we received just prior to the last debate in the Council, we were led to believe that by this time we would be celebrating the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation and that there would be free movement of people and goods throughout Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">As we meet today, the implementation of the remaining and crucial aspects of the Lusaka Protocol, particularly the incorporation of UNITA troops into the Angolan Armed Forces, demobilization and the extension of State administration throughout Angola, have not yet been completed. We are constantly faced with new elements being introduced in order to delay or postpone actions already agreed upon. This should not be allowed to continue. We concur with the observations in the Secretary-General's report that attempts to introduce linkages or conditions for moving the peace process forward should not be supported by the international community and must be abandoned immediately.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">In order for the peace process in Angola to make tangible and desirable progress, UNITA has to take urgent and decisive steps towards the implementation of all aspects of the Lusaka Protocol. The UNITA leadership has to ensure that deputies to the National Assembly, as well as those who are to take part in the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, return to Luanda.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">We believe that the Angolan Government has shown commitment, made efforts to comply with its obligations and demonstrated the necessary political will to accommodate UNITA and its leadership so as to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">The international community, under the aegis of the United Nations, has played a constructive role in helping the Angolan people to restore peace in their land and reconcile.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa09">The Secretary-General's reports indicates that Angola continues to face severe economic challenges and that efforts are being undertaken by the Government and cooperating partners to address the situation and initiate a reconstruction programme. These efforts will not succeed if they are not backed by steady progress in the peace process, which will build confidence in the economy.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa10">The challenges of reintegrating demobilized soldiers and of demining can be dealt with more adequately in conditions of stability, with the Government providing the attention that these programmes require. The support of the international community in this area remains of paramount importance. Post-conflict peace-building is a necessary precondition for lasting peace and stability. Mozambique is undergoing a similar process. It is a daunting task, but it certainly pays dividends.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa11">We would also like to register our support for the Secretary-General's proposed phased withdrawal of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) and arrangements for a transition period. We equally support the extension of the UNAVEM III mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa12">In conclusion, my delegation wishes to reaffirm its continued unconditional support for and solidarity with the people and the Government of Angola in their search for peace. My delegation would also like to seize this opportunity to reiterate its gratitude to all members of the Security Council for their active commitment to the restoration of peace, harmony and national reconciliation in Angola.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Monteiro</span> <span class="nation">Cape Verde</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">I congratulate you, Sir, on the highly competent manner in which you have guided the work of the Security Council during the month of February. I also thank your predecessor, Ambassador Owada of Japan, for his very successful work during the course of the last month.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">I am grateful for the opportunity my delegation has been given to speak before the Council at this formal meeting on the question of Angola, which is a topic of the utmost importance to us.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">Looking back, we note the extent to which the Government and UNITA have progressed in their quest for peaceful national reconciliation. That path has been an extremely long and difficult one. Lusaka came about only after several missed opportunities. Subsequently, the prevailing lack of confidence became a major, multifaceted constraint that led to many uncertainties and setbacks.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">Throughout this entire process, the Angolan conflict has received extraordinary attention from the United Nations and the international community, and in particular from some of its member States. This has provided consistent and increasingly effective support for the cause of peace in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">We have now reached a stage that can be described only as a decisive turning-point, a stage at which two must become one: one Government, one army, one police force, and, lastly, one country.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">The first military units of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) have been withdrawn; further withdrawals are soon to take place, in keeping with the agreed time-tables; and the ceasefire continues to be very broadly respected.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">These are positive aspects in the field of military activities. However, these cannot mask the slowness and inadequacies in other areas of activity, such as in the essential area of the selection and integration of soldiers and officers of UNITA into the Angolan Armed Forces and the National Police.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">However, reconstruction and the demining of roads seem to be proceeding satisfactorily; they are being carried out as part of a planned institutional framework. These activities will have a positive and immediate impact on the lives of the people and will restore their confidence.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">Likewise, we note improvements in certain significant areas of economic management, such as lower inflation and a stabilization of the exchange rate, as well as other measures adopted as regards prices and budgetary activities. We congratulate the Government on these accomplishments and express the hope that this initial success will gain strength and become part of a broader process of reversing the economic and social situation in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">All eyes are now focused on the completion of the establishment of the Angolan Parliament and the setting up of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. This is as it should be. These two issues are indeed the keystone of the Lusaka accords. To a certain extent, they represent the final test of confidence -- the point of no return.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa11">The two successive deferrals of the dates agreed for these events fully justify the prevailing sense of concern and urgency. My delegation fully endorses the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's report of 7 February on this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa12">Indeed, given that the establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation has been stalled, it would be unreasonable for us to expect to be able to implement the upcoming complementary agreements, or others that the parties might enter into in the near future, with a view further to hone this common endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa13">Quite the contrary: the political will must be mustered to follow the course that has been charted and thus build on the accrued capital of goodwill and understanding. We are confident that this will be the case and that the Angolan political scene will soon see decisive action.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa14">In the report I mentioned earlier, the Secretary-General, while issuing recommendations concerning a United Nations presence throughout 1997, is making a more immediate proposal to extend UNAVEM's mandate for one month, indicating that a closer follow-up of the commitments that are in abeyance is considered good policy.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa15">The next report of the Secretary-General, which will come out before the end of the period in question, will be reporting to the Council on the expected establishment of the Government. The Council will be deliberating on this basis. We hope that the report will note positive developments and thereby spare the Council the need to impose measures, including those provided for in paragraph 26 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a> of 15 September 1993. Nonetheless, the Council is prepared to do so if necessary, as stipulated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1098(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1098 (1997)</a>, which it has just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa16">In the forthcoming phase of the United Nations mission in Angola, apart from support for national reconciliation as such, special emphasis will be placed on humanitarian issues in view of the way they are considered in this context. The issues of relief and rehabilitation, quartering and demobilization will be included.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa17">Significant resources will be required. The figures speak for themselves: almost half a million former combatants and their families, a million displaced persons, tens of thousands of refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa18">It is essential, if we are to avoid the worst at either the humanitarian or the security level, that international efforts to finance scheduled activities be maintained. To that end, the response to the comprehensive inter-agency appeal that is being planned must be such as to meet this challenge.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa19">In conclusion, we thank the Secretary-General for his persistent and consistent efforts, as can be seen in his report of 7 February, which clearly shows the changes to be made in the United Nations presence on the ground in Angola during the next phase, which is one of observation. This presence will focus more on promoting national reconciliation and on consolidating the newfound peace.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa20">We join the Government of Angola in once again expressing our thanks for the untiring efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. We thank also the three Observer States and the other Member States that have been contributing to the cause of peace in Angola.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Andjaba</span> <span class="nation">Namibia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of February. Given your experience and diplomatic skill, we have no doubt that the Council will be provided with sure leadership. At the same time, we wish to extend our sincere congratulations to your predecessor, Ambassador Owada of Japan, for the remarkable way in which he conducted the affairs of the Council during the month of January.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">My delegation would also like to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the situation in Angola, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1997-115.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/115</a> of 7 February 1997, and for his efforts to further the cause of peace in that country. The same sentiments are extended to his Special Representative, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, whose devotion to bringing peace to Angola has been exemplary.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">Let me also extend my Government's gratitude to the troika -- the Governments of Portugal, Russia and the United States -- in their search for peace in Angola. Our appreciation is also extended to the entire UNAVEM III staff, the United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations for their tireless efforts in carrying out their respective mandates with determination under difficult conditions. I would like to assure them of my Government's full support.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">On 11 December 1996, I made a statement before this body in which, among other things, I expressed the grave concern to my Government over certain areas: the desertion of UNITA troops from the quartering areas; the delay in implementing all outstanding political and military issues, especially the agreement on the status of the leader of UNITA; the establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation; the establishment of state administration in various regions of the country; and the demobilization and incorporation of UNITA troops into the Angolan Armed Forces. Despite the fact that the peace process has witnessed some encouraging developments in recent months, these concerns today remain unresolved, owing mainly to the lack of cooperation by UNITA.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">The delay by UNITA creates serious doubts in our minds about whether it is really committed to the implementation of the letter and spirit of the Lusaka Protocol. In this regard, we call upon the parties, in particular UNITA, to consider, first of all, the interests of the people of Angola, who have seen no peace in their lifetime. UNITA needs to be reminded in a very clear message that the people of Angola need peace and that Angola needs development. This is the primary responsibility of all the leaders in Angola. They should therefore come together and form the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation without further delay. If they fail to do this, the Security Council must consider taking appropriate measures, including the imposition of sanctions against UNITA, in accordance with its relevant resolutions on Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">Finally, my delegation is pleased with the adoption this morning of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1098(1997).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1098 (1997)</a>, which, among other things, extends the mandate of UNAVEM III until 31 March 1997. We fully agree with the recommendation of the Secretary-General that the United Nations maintain its presence in Angola until the end of 1997 in order to ensure that the achievements made so far are consolidated.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mangoaela</span> <span class="nation">Lesotho</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of February. We are confident that the Council's business will profit from your wisdom and experience. I also wish to extend Lesotho's warmest congratulations to your predecessor, Ambassador Hisashi Owada of Japan, for a job well done last month. Allow me also to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his most insightful report on the situation in Angola and to his Special Representative, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, for his tireless efforts and unwavering commitment to the search for peace in Angola. The troika of the observers of the peace process and the countries contributing troops to the Angolan operations also deserve our commendation.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">When the Security Council reviewed the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) in December 1996, we were keenly aware of the slow pace in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, as a result of which the peace process continued to run behind schedule. Our hopes were rekindled, however, by some of the steps, limited as they were, that both the Government of Angola and UNITA were taking towards implementing the Lusaka Protocol. We were particularly pleased that the quartering of troops was proceeding relatively smoothly. Having thoroughly considered the report of the Secretary-General, and conscious of the need to keep the momentum of the peace process going, we reminded the signatories of the Lusaka Protocol of their obligations towards the Angolan people and the international community and supported the extension of the mandate of UNAVEM III, with the firm expectation that further progress would be made within a reasonable time frame in order to give new impetus to the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">The establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, which is the next crucial step towards an Angola free of the deep divisions that have characterized that country over the last three decades, remains elusive. We have been encouraging all parties to work together in good faith to complete the remaining tasks and form a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation without further delay.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">Despite a few signs of hope in the implementation of several tasks which were assigned to the parties, the Angolan peace process has again been characterized by difficulties and has been painfully slow and disappointing. It is regrettable that, as we meet today, the return to Luanda of UNITA deputies and the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation have once again been delayed, and the obligations of the Protocol have not been fulfilled. Besides threatening to unravel the gains made so far, these delays undermine the fragile peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">It is therefore a matter of great disappointment to us that we once again request this Council to ensure that UNITA fully complies with its obligations in a timely fashion and without any conditions or linkages, so as to bring about the long-awaited peace and stability in Angola and southern Africa. We believe that peace in Angola should be given a chance and it is for this reason that we support the extension of UNAVEM III to 31 March 1997, on the understanding that the situation will be reviewed on 20 March. If there is further procrastination, the Council should be at liberty to consider applying some of the measures within the framework of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 864 (1993)</a>, which shall oblige UNITA to respect fully and urgently the deadlines established by the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">The completion of the 15 quartering areas, followed by the quartering of over 70,000 UNITA troops, was a welcome development which demonstrated the political will of the Angolan leaders. In his report contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1997-115.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/115</a> of 7 February 1997, the Secretary-General informs us that the pace of the implementation of the remaining military and political tasks has also been very slow. It is regrettable that a large number of the quartered troops continue to leave the quartering areas, thus posing problems and further delays in the incorporation of UNITA troops into the Angolan Armed Forces. We again urge the parties to show real political will and complete the outstanding military tasks in order to put the process on the right path towards fulfilling the Lusaka Protocol commitments to the formation of a national army.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">The support of the international community for the Angolan peace process remains unshaken. This support has to be matched by commensurate political will measured through concrete and plausible actions on the part of the parties. It is therefore urgent and imperative for both parties, and in particular UNITA, to take decisive steps towards fulfilling their obligations under the Lusaka Protocol. This requires the parties to demonstrate the necessary flexibility and statesmanship in order for a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation to be established without further delay.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">The crisis in Angola has a negative impact on security and stability and on the economies within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. It is for this reason that the SADC countries require the parties to demonstrate the necessary flexibility to establish a new era of peace and cooperation in southern Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">Finally, we reiterate our call for the international community to continue to provide material support to the peace process at this crucial stage in order to facilitate the establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Lesotho for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of South Africa. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jele</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">South Africa adds its voice to those who have already congratulated you on your skilful stewardship of the Council's business during this month. We also extend our appreciation to Ambassador Owada of Japan for the most able manner in which he presided over the Council's deliberations during the month of January.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">The Secretary-General has placed before the Council a comprehensive report on the present status of the peace process in Angola, for which we thank him. My delegation also commends the ongoing efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to engage both parties in intensive consultations aimed at accelerating the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">It is most disappointing that the inauguration on 25 January 1997 of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation did not take place as envisaged in the December 1996 revised timetable of the Joint Commission, because UNITA withheld the dispatch of its deputies and officials nominated for the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation pending the resolution of the issue of the special status for its leader, Mr. Savimbi.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">Although in general the ceasefire continues to hold throughout Angola, it is a source of serious concern that there are still sporadic incidents of violence involving both parties, as these incidents could lead to an escalation of the conflict. In order to achieve lasting solutions to these problems, it is therefore important that both parties strictly observe the ceasefire and refrain from maintaining illegal checkpoints. We also feel that the dismantling of UNITA's four remaining command structures, as well as the provision of information on the strength and military equipment of the military detachment of the UNITA President, are issues which need urgent attention. My delegation is nevertheless gratified by the induction into the Angolan Armed Forces of the nine UNITA generals, which commenced on 20 December 1996, as well as by the arrival in Luanda of UNITA deputies and some ministers. We would, however, have had cause for greater optimism had all UNITA deputies and officials arrived in Luanda by the deadline of 12 February 1997. This would have facilitated an earlier installation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">We concur with the observation in the Secretary-General's report that in order to complete the implementation of the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol and to consolidate the gains made so far in the peace process, a continued, although reduced, presence of the United Nations in Angola will be required until the end of 1997. As the peace process enters a new phase, it will indeed be essential that the United Nations maintains its presence to ensure the completion of the process.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">We would also like to commend the international donor community for its tireless efforts in assisting the Angolan people with demining and with the repair of their war-ravaged infrastructure. More and generous assistance is needed to promote and sustain peace and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">We would also like to reiterate our previous plea for President Dos Santos and Mr. Savimbi to meet inside Angola as a matter of urgency. We believe that such a meeting is critical and would provide a welcome opportunity to address the issue of the status of Mr. Savimbi and other outstanding matters. However, my delegation believes, like many others, that any attempt in the course of addressing this issue to introduce linkages which impact on the implementation of the agreements should be regarded as unacceptable. We therefore urge the Council to take a firm and unequivocal stand in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">As the new Government in Angola will not be formed as envisaged, my delegation supports the extension of the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) until 31 March 1997. We urge that the Government of Angola and UNITA be prevailed upon to expedite the establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, and we are in full agreement with the request contained in the resolution just adopted that the Secretary-General report to the Council on 20 March 1997 on the status of the formation of the new government.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">The Council has repeatedly drawn attention to the reluctance of UNITA to implement outstanding military and political aspects of the Lusaka Protocol. We therefore feel strongly that the time has come for this body to act decisively and consider the implementation of appropriate measures against UNITA if it does not comply with its commitments.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">Allow me first, Sir, to convey the warm fraternal congratulations of my delegation on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of February. I am especially pleased that a worthy son of Africa has the honour of guiding the work of the Security Council at a time when, more than ever before, it is seized with questions of great importance for our continent. I am convinced that the Council will benefit greatly from your experience and from your wise and enlightened guidance.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">Might I also express the gratitude of my delegation to the Permanent Representative of Japan, who led the Council with competence and wisdom last month. At the same time I would like to convey to the Chinese delegation all our sympathy, our deep feelings and our solidarity in the wake of the passing of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who has left his mark on the history of China and of all the world's peoples. Finally, I should like to bid welcome to Vice-Minister Carneiro of Angola and to tell him how much we appreciated the important statement he made this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">The peace process in Angola is once again deadlocked. The indications provided by the Secretary-General in his recent report on the situation in Angola do not, unfortunately, inspire optimism, because of the great uncertainty for the future for peace in that brotherly country.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">Encouraging progress in the implementation of the military aspects of the Lusaka accords, rather than clearing the way for irreversible progress towards national reconciliation, has, unfortunately, been somewhat eroded, as is shown by the ever-increasing number of UNITA soldiers deserting the quartering areas. This is a disquieting phenomenon, and a source of serious concern for the international community and for the Angolan people, who have a legitimate aspiration to live in peace and stability and to devote their energy to the tasks of development and nation-building.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">The Secretary-General in his latest report to the Security Council, and the Security Council in its presidential statement of 30 January, clearly identify UNITA and its leadership as being responsible for the difficulties encountered in the process to implement all aspects of the Lusaka accords. The UNITA leadership is, without question, responsible before history, before the international community and before the Angolan people, for sabotaging the peace process, in which the international community has invested considerable effort, and for which it has made enormous sacrifices. In this context I should like to pay sincere tribute to the work and devotion of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), in which my country has the honour to participate.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">The obstructionist attitude and the delaying tactics of the UNITA leadership have clearly prevented the peace process from making new progress towards national reconciliation, in particular with regard to the establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation and the conclusion of an arrangement relating to the status of the leader of UNITA in keeping with the conclusions of the Lusaka accords. I should like here to welcome the positive attitude, open-mindedness and spirit of national understanding of the Angolan Government, which have made possible the progress that we have seen to date.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">Recent developments in the peace process in Angola require the international community to treat the matter with a greater sense of urgency. The Security Council in particular must not allow the peace process to become hostage to the delaying tactics of the UNITA leadership. It is clear that, rather than merely sending a political message to the UNITA leaders, the Council must shoulder its responsibilities by taking the necessary steps to make them adopt a more constructive attitude and honour the commitments they undertook in the framework of the Lusaka accords and the arrangements that they concluded with the Angolan Government, with the assistance and backing of UNAVEM.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">In renewing the mandate of UNAVEM III for a final period, the Security Council is counting on the sincerity, political will and good faith of UNITA. Events have shown that the UNITA leadership seems to be gambling on wearing down the international community to make it disengage, either to shatter the dynamic for peace in the country or to obtain extravagant advantages with regard to arrangements already concluded.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">At this crucial time for peace in Angola, the international community and the Security Council are called on to demonstrate, on the one hand, their solidarity with the people of Angola, and, on the other, a firm attitude towards UNITA. The international community cannot and must not become discouraged. Peace must be given another chance, because the future of the Angolan people is at stake, and, indeed, the security and peace of the continent of Africa.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Amorim</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">I should like, first of all, to congratulate you, Ambassador Mahugu, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of February. We are confident that under your wise guidance the work of the Security Council will be conducted in a highly effective way. Let me also take this opportunity to express our appreciation to your predecessor, Ambassador Hisashi Owada, for the competence with which he presided over the Council during the month of January.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">I should also like to present the condolences of the people and the Government of Brazil to the people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, on the passing away of the honourable leader, Deng Xiaoping.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">Once again, we pay tribute to the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, for his active role in bridging differences with a view to consolidating the peace process. Likewise, the endeavours of the troika of observer States should be recognized. I should also like to mention here the important presence of Mr. Higino Carneiro Vice-Minister without Portfolio of Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">The original mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) comes to an end tomorrow. Since it was first devised, UNAVEM III was planned to have a very clear "exit policy". It was envisaged that the tasks entrusted to it would be completed by February 1997. The facts, however, show that some of the tasks have yet to be fulfilled for lack of appropriate conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">The Government of National Unity and Reconciliation has not yet been formed. The status of Jonas Savimbi has not been clearly defined. Some of the military issues remain unresolved. In the quartering areas, UNITA soldiers still await demobilization. The incorporation of UNITA soldiers into the new Armed Forces is still well behind schedule.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">The United Nations has continuously striven for a lasting solution; it cannot be faulted for these delays. The main responsibility for the restoration of peace in Angola lies with the Angolans themselves. In particular, it should be noted that UNITA is required to take urgent and decisive steps to enable the peace process to be finalized. In his report contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1997-115.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1997/115</a>, the Secretary-General stresses that:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg022-bk02-pa07">"The pace of implementation of the remaining military and political tasks, owing mainly to the lack of cooperation of UNITA, has, once again, been painfully slow and disappointing". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-1997-115.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/115</a>, para. 51</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">One is led to recall once more that the international community has invested a great many resources in Angola in the past two years. UNAVEM III continues to be the largest United Nations peacekeeping operation now in place, and it represents a huge financial involvement for troop contributors, such as my own country. On the one hand, it is clear that the international community will not be able to maintain this level of involvement in Angola for much longer. On the other hand, the Security Council must take care not to withdraw UNAVEM III from the country before the peace process has become irreversible. The establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation is one of the major objectives in this regard, but other aspects such as the remaining military issues must be borne in mind.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">In examining the present situation, Brazil understands that an expression of readiness by the Security Council to consider the imposition of measures, including those specifically mentioned in paragraph 26 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a>, would be the appropriate way to proceed at this crucial stage.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">The extension of the UNAVEM III mandate for just one month may not be the ideal solution, but, in view of the present circumstances, this is a way of exerting additional pressure, particularly on UNITA, whose lack of cooperation has continued to cause unjustified delays in the peace process. Let us hope that the main differences can be sorted out and that solutions can be reached, so that the Angolan people may finally attain a long-awaited and well deserved peace.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Brazil for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Abdellah</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">Allow me first of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the Security Council and to express our joy at seeing you guide the work of this body with your characteristic skill and talent. I also congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Owada of Japan, for his excellent work last month. Lastly, I would like to welcome His Excellency Mr. Higino Carneiro, Vice-Minister without Portfolio of the Government of Angola, who has come here especially to participate in this important debate.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">The Security Council is considering the situation in Angola at a time when the peace process in that country has entered a critical phase in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. While progress has indeed been made in the quartering of UNITA troops and their incorporation into the Angolan Armed Forces, delays nonetheless continue to hinder the completion of this process. This has necessitated additional expenditures, which could have been earmarked for other activities, such as the demobilization and integration of former armed elements into civilian life.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">The situation has become even more disturbing following the increase in the number of deserters from quartering camps. Moreover, we are sorry to note that the UNITA members called upon to sit in the Angolan National Assembly have not yet arrived in Luanda as scheduled and that the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation has not yet been established. These delays only serve to sow doubt and mistrust in people's minds and threaten to further delay the peace process after so much sacrifice and effort.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">The Angolan parties must urgently demonstrate the political will needed to move forward and that they endeavour, through dialogue and consultation, to overcome the obstacles to a definitive settlement. A meeting between President Dos Santos and the leader of UNITA would be most helpful for the consideration of all those issues that are still prompting these delays, including the question of the future status of Mr. Savimbi.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">It is essential that UNITA honour its commitments without further delay, notably that of dispatching its representatives to Luanda, both to the National Assembly and to the headquarters of the future Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. It must also cooperate fully, with an eye to facilitating the extension of State administration throughout Angolan territory, so as to preserve the unity of the country and to ensure that the entire population enjoys public services. The procedures and mechanisms approved by the Joint Commission last month for the extension of State administration to the entire territory must serve as a basis for this goal.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">In this context, my delegation would like to pay a resounding tribute to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, who has made commendable efforts to smooth out difficulties and reconcile the views of the parties. The good offices of the three Observer States have also proven to be of great assistance and deserve to be pursued with the sustained support of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">My delegation also commends the humanitarian organizations for their activities, notably their contribution to demobilization operations despite the security problems inherent in this type of situation. My delegation must also express its appreciation for the essential role that the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) has unflaggingly played since its establishment. Thanks to the dedication and courage of its staff, the United Nations Mission has discharged its mandate in an exemplary fashion. It is essential that the two Angolan parties cooperate fully to help UNAVEM III to carry out its activities and to build on its achievements at a time when the Secretary-General is considering a transition plan for the United Nations Mission in the light of the progress made towards national reconciliation and peace.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">My delegation supports the extension of the mandate of UNAVEM III until 31 March 1997, as has just been decided. It is now up to UNITA to comply, unconditionally and without delay, with all the agreements that it has entered into under the Lusaka Protocol, failing which the Security Council would be compelled to consider appropriate measures.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">Lastly, I would highlight the importance of the international community's support for efforts aimed at restoring total peace in Angola. That country, devastated by a long fratricidal war, today requires the assistance of the international community for its economic recovery. My delegation commends all those parties that have contributed to the task of reconstruction and rehabilitation and expresses the wish that this commitment be strengthened in order to enable Angola once again to travel the path of peace, stability and prosperity.</p>

	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Tunisia for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of the Netherlands. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Berteling</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The following associated countries have aligned themselves with this statement: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Iceland and Norway also wish to align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">As I understand, Sir, that today is the penultimate day of your presidency, I should like to voice the appreciation of the European Union for your able stewardship of the Council during this month of February.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">During recent months, the Angolan peace process has shown some signs of progress: political contacts between the parties have taken place in the framework of the Joint Commission; violations of the ceasefire have diminished; the incorporation of UNITA troops into the Angolan Armed Forces has started; most UNITA policemen have been quartered; and the free movement of persons and goods throughout the country is improving.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">However, the peace process remains far from completed. UNITA, in particular, has yet to demonstrate its unequivocal commitment to the terms of the Lusaka Protocol. The slow pace of implementation of several crucial aspects of the peace process, in particular the integration of UNITA soldiers and officers into the Angolan Armed Forces and the Angolan National Police, demobilization and the extension of State administration throughout Angola, is cause for serious concern. The disarmament of the civilian population as well as the overall human rights situation remain unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">Further delays and difficulties have recently arisen. The European Union notes with concern that not all UNITA National Assembly members and officials designated for the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation had arrived in Luanda by the agreed date of 12 February 1997. As a consequence of the refusal by UNITA to meet the time-table established by the Joint Commission in the context of the Lusaka Protocol, the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation could not, as envisaged, be formed before the expiration of the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) on 28 February. In this regard, we wish to stress once again that linkages between the establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation and other outstanding or newly raised issues are not acceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">The European Union attaches paramount importance to preserving the spirit of Lusaka and is firmly committed to a long and lasting peace in Angola. The ultimate responsibility for the restoration of peace in Angola, however, rests with the Angolans themselves. In order to ensure the continued involvement of the international community in the peace process, it is imperative for the parties, in particular UNITA, to take urgent and decisive steps to fulfil their commitments. The European Union shares the view of the international community that continued pressure should be applied until compliance with the commitments undertaken in the Lusaka Protocol is assured. We therefore fully endorse the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III by only one month, until 31 March 1997, and we support the readiness of the Council to consider the imposition of appropriate measures, should the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation not have been formed by that date.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">The European Union will follow closely the discussion on the recommendations made by the Secretary-General on the future role of the United Nations in Angola. We agree with the Secretary-General that the pace of the planned withdrawal of United Nations-formed military units should take into account the state of affairs on the ground as regards, <i>inter alia</i>, the formation of the Angolan Armed Forces, demobilization, the closure of quartering areas and the extension of State administration.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">Over the years, the European Union and its member States have already provided substantial support -- in the order of several hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars -- for humanitarian, reconstruction and development activities in Angola. We continue to respond to specific needs. As the security situation in some regions continues to hamper the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the carrying out of reconstruction and development assistance, there is still an urgent need for security guarantees for international personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">We all are aware of the horrors that anti-personnel mines can cause to innocent civilians, often children. That is why the European Union and its member States have been among those who have provided significant political, financial, material and personnel support for demining activities. The United Nations has already cleared 4,500 kilometres of roads, and the training of Angolan demining brigades is continuing. The planned transfer by 1 March 1997 of the responsibility for support of the national mine clearance programme from UNAVEM III and the Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) cannot take place before the project concerning the development of a national mine clearance capacity in Angola has been approved. We therefore call upon the Angolan Government to do so urgently. The European Union wishes to express its concern at recent reports about the hampering of mine clearing activities, and calls on the parties, particularly on UNITA, to cooperate in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">Finally, I should like to pay tribute to Special Representative Maître Beye, who is with us today, for his untiring efforts and unwavering optimism in helping to bring the peace process forward. We should also like to express our deep appreciation for the role played by the three Observer States -- Portugal, the United States and the Russian Federation -- and for the important contributions made by the staff of UNAVEM III, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations in support of the consolidation of peace and national reconciliation in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">I should like to conclude by expressing the European Union's sincere condolences to the Government and people of China on the loss of their Paramount Leader, Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who contributed so much to the economic development of his country and its opening up to the international community.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">Before I make my statement, I am duty-bound to express, on behalf of my country, Mali, our sentiments of friendship to the People's Republic of China. I wish to convey once again to the representative of China our heartfelt words of condolence to him on the passing of Deng Xiaoping. China's loss is also Mali's.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">Mr. President, the delegation of Mali is pleased to see the Council meeting under your leadership during this month of February. Likewise, my delegation associates itself with previous speakers in congratulating your predecessor, Ambassador Owada, on the competence and authority with which he presided over the work of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">My delegation would like to welcome here General Carneiro, the head of the Angolan delegation. We listened carefully to his enlightening and constructive statement.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">I should like also to associate myself with previous speakers in conveying our gratitude to the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his exhaustive, clear and instructive report on this agenda item.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">Finally, might I convey the congratulations of my delegation to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Angola, our compatriot, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, and to the members of the troika, as well as to entire personnel of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) for their tireless efforts to advance the peace process in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Since our last meeting, the situation in Angola has seen considerable progress, which indicates that the peace process in that country is at a decisive turning-point. That is why this meeting is so important, because in the opinion of my delegation, it must take the peace process to its final phase. All hopes are now pinned on the full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, signed by the Government of Angola and UNITA on 20 November 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">The international community has allocated major resources in support of these hopes, notably through the establishment of UNAVEM III. It is imperative that these efforts bear fruit.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">The Government of Angola, which my delegation warmly congratulates, has made considerable efforts to discharge its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol. Unfortunately, this good will has not always been demonstrated by UNITA, whose delaying tactics my delegation strongly deplores. In this respect, my delegation once again appeals to UNITA to implement on a priority basis the military obligations it undertook to fulfil many months ago.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">My delegation sincerely hopes that the aspirations of the international community will not be disappointed once again and that UNITA will prove itself in the days to come on the occasion of the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">With regard to the current situation in Angola, the delegation of Mali welcomes the extension of the mandate of UNAVEM III, which remains the guarantor of peace and stability. My delegation therefore supports the firm, clear message sent to UNITA through the threat of sanctions to convince that movement to stick more faithfully to the peace process. That attitude alone, in the view of my delegation, can help the people of Angola to achieve their desire for peace and to build a better future geared towards development and democracy.</p>

The Chinese delegation will convey their messages to the Chinese Government and people, as well as to the family of Mr. Deng. We will certainly convey these condolences and their sincere wishes.</p>
